News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Latest Update for Google Home Gives It Upper Hand over Amazon’s Echo By Zara Ali Apr 21, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Home is the smart speaker that gives you an account of your every day and completes tasks by voice commands. It is one nifty device to have at your home to keep all the services streamlined. However, the only limitation on the device was its support for just one user account, but Google has changed it now. In its latest update, Google Home is getting multi-user support. This feature is currently limited to the users in the US but Google is expected to enhance the reach in the coming months. With this new update, Home users can train the device to recognise up to six different voices. It means that you can now connect different Google accounts on a single Google Home device. Multi-user support has made Google Home ideal for Home use as up to six family members can activate it with their voices. Related How To Connect Netflix, Spotify, and Pandora Accounts With Google Home Advertisement Google has employed its artificial intelligence neural networks technology to bring multi-user support to its smart home speaker. The same technology is used for Google search and Google translate. For now, only one account per user can be linked to Home. You cannot link both work and personal accounts with the device, you have to choose one. Related Google Home App Gets A New ‘Listen’ Tab For Easier Music Discovery And Streaming In a blog post about the latest update for Google Home, the company writes: When you connect your account on a Google Home, we ask you to say the phrases “Ok Google” and “Hey Google” two times each. Those phrases are then analyzed by a neural network, which can detect certain characteristics of a person’s voice. From that point on, any time you say “Ok Google” or “Hey Google” to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so it can understand if it’s you speaking or not. This comparison takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds. Now that Google Home has multi-user support, we wonder if Amazon Echo would also get it anytime soon. Amazon’s team is tipped to be developing new features for the Echo, which will make it compatible with the third-party services. These services also include Google products that are not yet compatible with Google Home.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Play Music Is the Default Music Player for Galaxy S8 Loaded with Extra Benefits By Zara Ali Apr 21, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit Samsung devices are not ideally bloat-free, in fact, the South Korean giant has faced quite a flak for its bloatware. The company has come a long way for its flagships and is now trying to steer clear of bloatware. In the latest development, Samsung revealed that Google Play Music would be the default music player on the Galaxy S8 lineup. We couldn’t be happier, as Play Music is any day better than any other third-party app brought by Samsung. Besides, Google Play Music is also showering some added benefits for the Galaxy S8. The service would allow users to save up to 100,000 songs the player for free. The storage capacity for the Galaxy S8 owners is almost double of what other phone users are currently getting. Making the deal sweeter, Google has also thrown in a three-month free trial of Play Music’s subscription-based streaming service. The audio library on Play Music includes more than 40 million songs, which means that the Galaxy S8 will have a huge spread of songs to choose and listen for free – for three months. Related Google Might Bring Its Default Ad-Blocking Feature for Chrome Browser Advertisement The benefits are not limited to Google Play Music only; the Galaxy S8 users would also get free access to YouTube Red. However, if you have already registered on YouTube Red, then this offer won’t be valid for you, even if you are a Galaxy S8 user. Google Play Music will also work with Samsung’s AI assistant – Bixby, which will debut on the Galaxy S8 later this Spring. Whenever Bixby comes on the phone, users will be able to command it to access Google Play Music. You just have to ask the assistant to “play music” and it will by default open Google’s Play Music app. For now, it is not clear whether the Galaxy S8 users would be allowed to tweak Bixby’s settings to make it choose their preferred music app for playing music by default. Related Google Accidentally Releases a “Confidential Internal Only” Update to Pixel XL To conclude, we would say that this partnership between Samsung and Google’s Play Music service seems legit. It stands to reason that many Galaxy S8 buyers would not use Google Play Music as the default app, as many users these days prefer services like Spotify, Tidal, Pandora, and others. However, it is still better that Samsung chose Play Music instead of coming up with its own service.

The 58-cm rover will be launched aboard an Indian rocket in December for the Google Lunar Xprize, a $20 million inducement prize contest organized by X Prize Foundation, an American nonprofit organization encouraging technological development through public competitions, and sponsored by Google Inc. In addition to the Japanese team called Hakuto, Indian, Israeli, U.S. and multinational groups will all launch lunar probes by the end of this year as well. The five probes will be required to move more than 500 meters on the surface of the moon and send high-definition moving and static images to Earth. The prize money will go to the first team to transmit the images. The United States, the former Soviet Union and China are the only countries that have successfully sent moon probes as national projects. The Xprize competition is aimed at promoting private-sector space exploration. Team Hakuto was formed in 2010 under the leadership of Takeshi Hakamada, founder and chief executive officer of ispace Inc., a space exploration startup in Tokyo. Hakuto’s technology is based on many years of research and development by Kazuya Yoshida, professor of aerospace engineering at Tohoku University. “We want to demonstrate that a private-sector project on the stage of space is possible,” Hakamada said. The surface environment of the moon is severe. Covered with regolith, or a layer of dust, soil and other superficial material, the temperature difference between day and night is more than 250 degrees. The moon is effectively surrounded by a vacuum and directly exposed to heat from the sun and cosmic radiation. The temperature rises to more than 100 degrees in the daytime and drops to more than 150 degrees below zero at night. The team revised the design of the rover seven times to overcome challenges including the severe environment and costs. To protect equipment in the rover, the vehicle is coated with fluorine resin that keeps the internal temperature between 60 and minus 25. Team Hakuto has also developed an adhesive that can resist the gap in temperatures. The rover itself is made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, the same extremely strong and light composite material used in modern aircraft. The plastic, in combination with design changes, reduced the rover’s weight to 4 kg from about 10 kg for a steep cost cut. A launch costs around ¥120 million (about $1 million) per kg of payload. The probe’s wheels have teeth made of a flexible plastic also used in eyeglass frames designed to prevent slippage while the rover traverses the lunar surface. Hakuto means white rabbit in Japanese and refers to a Japanese folktale in which the shape of a rabbit can be made out from darker parts of the moon’s surface. In February, the team picked Sorato (space rabbit) as the name of the rover after soliciting some 37,000 suggestions from the public. Following final tests on the Tottori Sand Dunes in Tottori Prefecture to determine the feasibility and durability of Sorato under extreme conditions, the rover will be sent to India in August to be launched together with the Indian team’s probe on Dec. 28. The probes are expected to reach the moon in about a month. “We will steadily advance preparations to win the competition,” Hakamada said.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > From home to outer space, the new Google Earth is… From home to outer space, the new Google Earth is full of things to do By Julian Chokkattu — April 20, 2017 3:30 PM Subscribe Share Google Earth Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: It was already easy enough to lose yourself in Google Earth. Whether you’re dodging through the narrow alleys of Kobe, Japan, or skimming Lake Achen in Austria, Google Earth offers rich 360-degree content, along with spectacular satellite imagery that can satiate any hunger for exploration. But Google went a step further this week with a major update that not only redesigned the interface, but also added rich textual and visual content from partners such as BBC Earth, NASA, and the Jane Goodall Institute. The new Voyager tab acts as a curated magazine that houses stories from these select partners, and it even features never before seen behind-the-scenes content from shows such as Planet Earth II. There’s also plenty of packaged content from the Google Street View team you can check out. Say goodbye to any other plans you had this weekend, as we explore all the new possibilities in the new Google Earth. This is home The first address most of us type when we see the blue marble floating in space is home. It’s why one of the highlights of the Culture category in the new Voyager tab is a series called “This is Home.” This series takes a look at some traditional homes of cultures and people most of us may not know much about. There are five homes you can visit at the moment: an Inuit Igloo, Bedouin tent, Reed House, Sherpa home, and Greenlandic Illoq. Tap on one and you’ll be taken to the geographical coordinates, with a brief description of the person and the area. There are usually three “cards” telling the story of the culture and the home — the first shows the satellite view, the second offers a Street View 360-degree image, and the third takes us into the home itself. Stories of more homes are on the way. This is Home Nature and wildlife Google Earth With the new Voyager tab, you can learn more about nature and wildlife than ever before. Partners include BBC Earth, the Jane Goodall Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, and The Ocean Agency, among others. What’s neat is that much of the content is from decades of back catalogs from these various agencies, and you can even find behind-the-scenes content that has yet to be aired — such as when the BBC Earth team found a Komodo dragon in their bathroom. A lot of this content includes videos you can watch in Google Earth, without needing to leave the site. The Natural Treasures series, for example, lets you choose environments like “Islands,” “Mountains,” and “Jungles,” to explore. For example, if you choose Mountains, you’ll get a story describing major mountains and the surrounding area. Most of these have accompanying videos you can enjoy. “We’re trying to give viewers that deeper experience,” Chadden Hunter, a producer at the BBC Natural History Unit, told Digital Trends. “With this fully interactive tool, we’re hoping people will just explore for hours.” There’s a lot of content to sift through, as there’s more than a 100 assets from BBC Earth alone. You can check it all out by tapping on the Voyager icon on the left, and clicking on Nature. The view from space Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends You can’t talk about Earth and satellite images without mentioning NASA, a partner with the new Google Earth. The space agency currently has two stories you can explore in Google Earth: “Scenes from Space” and “Reading the ABCs from Space.” The latter involves scrolling through the alphabet with geographical structures that look just like the letters — you’ll also find fun, quirky descriptions with each letter. “Scenes from Space” takes a look at gorgeous landscapes via satellite images, with a description and links to read more about what you’re seeing. To check out NASA Earth Observatory’s content, tap the Voyager icon, and head to Nature. Travel and history Google Earth Google already has Trips, an app you can use to plan your next vacation, but you can use the new Google Earth for this as well. The Travel tab in Voyager offers curated points of interest in major cities around the world, such as Paris, Tokyo, New York City, and more. If you choose to explore Paris, for example, you can find stories like “72 Hours in Paris: Day 1,” where you’ll see multiple points of interest to visit. The History tab seems to be more of an assortment of random stories from the Street View team and some other partners. The list here is small, but you can explore interesting pieces such as “The Hidden Worlds of the National Parks,” and “Lost Civilizations from Above.” A surprising Sesame Street tie-in Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Sesame Street is broadcast in more than 150 countries, reaching more than 156 million children around the world. The tie-in here is to provide educational content for children through the Muppets, who act as role models promoting education, good habits, respect, and understanding. The first story from Sesame Street on Google Earth is called “Girls Around the World,” and you’ll find aired content from 12 different co-productions in places such as Afghanistan and India. Tap on a country and children can learn a little about the place, meet the local Muppet, and even see the Muppet interviewing locals. There’s also a lot of content that’s told by kids, for kids. To find Sesame Street in Google Earth, tap on the Voyager icon on the left, tap on Culture, and find Sesame Street’s Girls Around the World. Expect more content to be added often. Sesame Street’s Girls Around the World Tips and tricks Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends There are a few neat tricks in the new Google Earth you should know about. Firstly, if you have a Google Chromecast, you can cast to your TV. On Chrome, find the Cast icon on the top right and share your tab to a nearby Chromecast device. On Android, you’ll need to open the Google Home app, slide out the navigation drawer, and tap on Cast screen/audio.  There’s also a dice icon below Voyager on the sidebar — tap it to trigger “I’m Feeling Lucky,” where Google will take you to a random point in the world. You can bookmark any place you visit, and you can find these saved places in the My Places tab on the sidebar. You can also share a location with just a link. Tap the Share icon in the sidebar and you can either copy the link to your clipboard, or share it directly to Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Immerse yourself to the max in VR Got an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive? The Google Earth VR app is now available on both platforms, and it allows you to fly to anywhere in the world. You can take cinematic tours, visit featured places, and even move the position of the sun to transform the place you’re in from day to night. You can grab the app from the Oculus store here, and you can find it on Steam for the HTC Vive. Google told Digital Trends that Voyager content will regularly be updated with partners. The new Google Earth is available on Android and the Google Chrome browser. An iOS version is in the works, and the company is looking to bring the experience to other browsers as well.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 100 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off. Rest of the settings are stock out of the box. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d6d107fe72843084747728a2ff7d6ed0c69dbb8828498d680a8e574909c8d80.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/69216e0f531ae12996c1fea6d785844e4b1d5cb6f74e5a1f1b39973b6d6f25d5.png Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 296 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares513 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Google tweaks YouTube's Restricted Mode to allow LGBT-related videos; lays out guidelines for content creators Google has tweaked YouTube's Restricted Mode to allow streaming of mature video related to LGBT, political viewpoints, race, religion orientation, provided they conform to its newly laid-out guidelines. Rohit KVN   April 23, 2017 10:01 IST [Representational Image]REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson In a welcome move, Search engine giant Google has tweaked YouTube Restricted mode's algorithm to allow of video streaming of mature subjects including LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender), political viewpoints, race, religion orientation and more. "Back in March, our community alerted us that our systems were not working as intended, in particular, that we were unintentionally filtering content from Restricted Mode that shouldn't have been. After a thorough investigation, we started making several improvements to Restricted Mode," YouTube said in a statement. Also read: Google Home now supports 6 different voices; here's how to add new accounts in 4 simple steps The company's engineering have fixed an issue that was incorrectly filtering videos for Restricted Mode.With the change, users can now access to 12 million additional videos of all types -- including hundreds of thousands featuring LGBTQ+ content -- in Restricted Mode. Further, YouTube also laid out the guideline for video content creators, as well. Here are rules you should know before you create YouTube video content: Drugs and alcohol: If you're talking about drug use or abuse, or if you're drinking alcohol in your videos, your videos will likely not be available in Restricted Mode. Sex: While some educational, straightforward conversations about sexual education may be included in Restricted Mode, overly detailed conversations about sex or sexual activity will likely be removed. This is one of the more difficult topics to train our systems on, and the context is key. If your music video features adult themes like sex or drug use, that video will likely not make it into Restricted Mode. Violence: If your video includes graphic descriptions of violence, violent acts, natural disasters and tragedies, or even violence in the news, it will likely not appear in Restricted Mode. Mature subjects: Videos that cover specific details about events related to terrorism, war, crime, and political conflicts that resulted in death or serious injury may not be available on Restricted Mode, even if no graphic imagery is shown. Profane language: Inappropriate language including profanity like "F bombs" will also likely result in your video not being available in Restricted Mode.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Helpless Bixby button on Samsung Galaxy S8 gets remapped to Google Assistant, once again A free app called BixRemap allows users to remap the Bixby button on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Google Assistant without requiring any reboot. Kukil Bora   April 23, 2017 09:30 IST According to the company, Bixby is not just another digital assistant, it's an aide to help users better perform the litany of tasks with their smartphones.Samsung Samsung's recent update to block the ability to remap the Bixby button on the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ couldn't last for long as a developer named Dave Bennett has come up with an app that lets you bypass that blockade. The new app called BixRemap is a simple app that allows you to launch Google Assistant on top of Bixby whenever you press the dedicated Bixby button on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Once you press the button, you will first see a brief Bixby start up before Google Assistant kicks it out of the way to take over the show. The best thing about BixRemap is that it allows the Bixby button to be remapped without requiring you to reboot the device. All you need to do is install the app, which is now available on the Google Play Store, toggle on one switch to allow it to access Usage Data and hit a big Start Service button. "I was really determined to find a new way to Launch Google now when I pressed the Bixby button. So I threw together a quick app in 20 minutes to do just that. It looks for Bixby in the foreground and launches Google Now on top of it. I can develop it further if there's any interest, right now it's just a basic app," Bennett wrote on Reddit. The Bixby button on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 can be remapped again, thanks to this free app.Google Play Although the app is not a very elegant solution at this point of time, a more polished version of it is expected soon as Bennett is counting on suggestions from those who have tried his app. Meanwhile, some users on Reddit have suggested Bennett to add a launch on boot option, and also to set the notification priority to the lowest to avoid the persistent icon on the status bar. Bennett said he liked the idea, and is apparently working on it. Following the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, an app called All in One Gestures surfaced online allowing users to remap the exclusive Bixby button to anything they wanted. There was another app called Button Mapper, which could exploit Accessibility Services to intercept the key events generated after pressing the Bixby button, and redirect the system to launch a different app. However, it did not bode well for Samsung, and the company rolled out an OTA updated to remove this functionality. A Samsung executive even took to Twitter to confirm the move. What might have triggered users' lack of interest towards the Bixby button is the fact that Samsung's new AI-based virtual assistant is still a half-baked solution with no support for voice commands. It was one of the most important features the company boasted about while announcing the Galaxy S8.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue.

EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS!

Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off. Rest of the settings are stock out of the box. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d6d107fe72843084747728a2ff7d6ed0c69dbb8828498d680a8e574909c8d80.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/69216e0f531ae12996c1fea6d785844e4b1d5cb6f74e5a1f1b39973b6d6f25d5.png Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

(Photo: Kiichiro Sato / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump recently signed a joint congressional resolution that repealed the Federal Communications Commission’s privacy rules. The debate prompted an unusual amount of misleading sturm und drang. Let’s understand what’s really at stake. There is a common misconception that Congress stripped Americans of privacy rights. But consumers have the same rights today that they did before the vote. The joint resolution repealed an FCC order that was not scheduled to take effect until later this year. By repealing these rules, Congress preserved the status quo and consumers should see no difference because the law today is the same as it has been since at least 2015. The purpose of repeal is to restore a level playing field among digital advertisers. Internet-based companies such as Google and Facebook are subject to Federal Trade Commission regulation, which requires companies to notify consumers regarding what information is collected and how it is used, and to allow them to “opt out” of such collection efforts. These rules also governed broadband providers until 2015, when the FCC inadvertently stripped the FTC of jurisdiction when it reclassified them as common carriers. The FCC could have corrected this error by simply applying the FTC rules to broadband providers. But it instead applied a stricter opt-in rule, which prohibited broadband providers from using consumer data unless the consumer gives explicit permission. Importantly, under both regimes, consumers ultimately control how their data is used. The only difference is the default rule: the FTC allows Google to use your data unless you say no, while the FCC would have allowed Verizon to use your data only if you say yes. This is a trivial distinction for consumers — but it would have given Google a tremendous advantage in the battle for internet advertising dollars, a market Google already dominates. Additionally, it is a common misunderstanding that broadband providers know more about you than companies like Google or Facebook. Broadband providers can’t really “see” all traffic — they can only gather information on one’s activities at home, while Google can capture data anywhere a person is logged into a Google account or using a Google operating system. Ultimately, privacy questions cannot be debated in a vacuum. Consumer information is the lifeblood of the internet. Our information is routinely collected by companies, but this is not necessarily problematic. Monetization of consumer data is what helps make Gmail, Facebook, YouTube and other services free — and might someday bring broadband prices down.

By Ethan Baron / April 22, 2017 at 5:59 PM At some point, a giant company can cross the line from market dominance to monopoly. Have Google, Facebook and Amazon reached that point? “Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising, Facebook (and its subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic and Amazon has a 74 percent share in the e-book market,” University of Southern California Annenberg Innovation Lab director emeritus Jonathan Taplin wrote in an April 22 op-ed in the New York Times. “In classic economic terms, all three are monopolies.” High-profile journalist Glenn Greenwald, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on National Security Agency spying on Americans (revealed in leaks by Edward Snowden) tweeted April 22 that a discussion on the tech firms’ market domination was “way overdue.” “The unrestrained power amassed by the Silicon Valley monopolies is staggering,” Greenwald tweeted. Google, Facebook and Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Taplin’s claims. In Europe, Google for seven years has been facing antitrust allegations from the European Union that the company abused its dominance in search. A decision in the case is expected within months. The Mountain View company this month also agreed to pay Russia a $7.85 million fine and open its Android mobile operating system to rival search engines in the country, after a dispute with Russian competition authorities. Taplin, in his op-ed, argued that Google, Facebook and Amazon “have stymied innovation on a broad scale.” With industry giants facing limited competition, incumbent companies have a profound advantage over new entrants, Taplin said. And the tech firms’ explosive growth has caused massive damage to companies already operating, he said. “The platforms of Google and Facebook are the point of access to all media for the majority of Americans. While profits at Google, Facebook and Amazon have soared, revenues in media businesses like newspaper publishing or the music business have, since 2001, fallen by 70 percent,” Taplin said. The rise of Google and Facebook have diverted billions of dollars from content creators to “owners of monopoly platforms,” he said. “All content creators dependent on advertising must negotiate with Google or Facebook as aggregator. Taplin proposed that for the three tech behemoths, there are “a few obvious regulations to start with.” At minimum, he said, the firms should be barred from buying major firms such as Spotify and Snapchat. “Monopoly is made by acquisition — Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa.” And another possible remedy, with Google, would be to regulate it as a public utility and require it “to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations,” Taplin said. And Taplin took aim at the “safe harbor” provision of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That section of the act protects internet companies from monetary damages when their users and other third parties commit violations against intellectual property. The safe harbor section “allows companies like Facebook and Google’s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others,” he said. Taplin acknowledged that under the administration of President Donald Trump — who has spoken strongly against government regulation and has moved to deregulate industries on a number of fronts — it’s unlikely a priority will be placed on regulating internet firms. “Ultimately we may have to wait four years, at which time the monopolies will be so dominant that the only remedy will be to break them up. Force Google to sell DoubleClick. Force Facebook to sell WhatsApp and Instagram.”   Photo: A Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa (AP Photo/Google, Connie Zhou, File) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: amazon, facebook, Glenn Greenwald, Google, monopolies, Monopoly, regulate, regulation   More Posts in 1 San Francisco startup Juicero’s $400 juice-maker turns out to be totally unnecessary: report April 19, 2017   Google unveils new Google Earth: Do you feel lucky?

A Quick Look At Google's New Messaging App - Messenger Liam Spradlin Follow View All Posts 2014/10/20 10:30am PDTOct 20, 2014 474 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 1 Share on Twitter Total Shares535 Applications Google Leaks News Ever since we first took a look at Motorola's Nexus 6 (and subsequently saw it leaked and finally announced) there's been a question about that blue and white icon in the dock. We learned directly from Google that it would be a new app called Messenger, that sounds like it will - for all intents and purposes - replace the AOSP messaging app that used to appear on stock devices. But Google didn't give up many details about the app, outside the fact that it would be "specially designed to be a quick and easy way to send and receive SMS and MMS messages on Android," with more information forthcoming. Luckily, we are now able to share a look at the app itself and how it works. Since Messenger isn't actually released yet (the app is still in testing, though a leaked dump has seen it circulated), this will come with the usual disclaimer that anything can change before release time. But what we'll look at below represents the app as it is at the time of writing. First up is the primary screen. It's got a "zen state" message just like Gmail for when your inbox is empty, but when you do have messages you can archive them with a simple swipe to the left or right. Like other instances where contacts appear, those without associated photos are represented by colored circles with the first letter of their name in white.   The interesting thing about these avatars, though, is their influence over the app's theme. If you are talking with someone who has a red circle avatar, your conversation with that person will be themed accordingly. The toolbar will be red, and the incoming word bubbles will be as well. The theming even carries over into that conversation's specific settings and the attach interface.    Speaking of the attach interface, you can attach photos or videos captured on the fly, an image or video from your gallery, or you can send a voice recording.     As you can see in the shots above, the functionality you'd expect is present. Group messages, the ability to search conversations, individual notification control, and more are all present. As for the actual app's settings, they closely mirror the current AOSP messaging app's settings, except in Messenger, the only storage option is to delete old messages "when storage is low." Gone is the option to set a specific limit on how many messages can be kept in a conversation before the old ones begin dropping off.   There don't appear to be many animations at this stage, but that's fine - this is a very basic app that does a few things in a really beautiful way without any extra flair. Users feeling burned by Hangouts' SMS integration will have no problem adapting to yet another means of SMS communication when Messenger is finally released with the new Nexus devices next month.

So far, other than a few minor bugs, it's been really smooth. teh Jax Agreed. There's a very functional ROOT available as well if you flash the custom kernel from Chainfire and load up the correct SuperSU. Even TiBu (with a test release, not the market version) works very well. Qbancelli If it doesn't have Quick Reply popup is dead to me. How hard is it to implement this Google? The 8sms app does this, and a lot more perfectly. Björn Lundén Good thing this app will likely be open source as part of AOSP then, unlike Hangouts so that others can implement that. Amrit Zoad Beautiful! Preston Mueller Should we expect this to be in AOSP? Jovie Brett Bardoles For real. Björn Lundén Yes, almost certainly. That would be the main reason for releasing this I imagine. Nadav THIS SHIT IS GOOD Jovie Brett Bardoles Thought this weird Messaging app is ugly, tho unexpectedly it is beautiful! Raloc I still can't get over the "why" of this. Why don't they just make Hangouts not suck instead of trying to bandage the wound by once again fragmenting their messaging services? Zak Taccardi because not every OEM wants to promote Hangouts as the default messaging service. It's the best solution to a shitty problem. Google should really put this app on the play store though. Victor Souza it's getting replaced by that stock Messenger that comes with Motos and Nexuses, almost certainly it's going to the Play Store Udayan Banerji So again, if OEMs can have a problem with Hangouts, they can have a problem with the stock messaging app as well, and will replace it with their own. At least Hangouts will remain the same on every phone. I agree with Raloc, why not fix Hangouts. I mean what is the excuse, and is it big enough that they will release a whole new app for that? Zak Taccardi Google cannot open source Hangouts. They can open source an SMS app. They need a material SMS app for OEMs to based their development off of. Google has developers working on BOTH of these problems. Just because you prefer hangouts doesn't mean everyone else has to. I personally love Hangouts. But there needs to be a material option for those who do not. Udayan Banerji Hangouts will soon be Material itself, don't you think so? Though I do get your point now, which is that OEMs can use this app as a reference. Thanks! Adonis K. They could make Hangouts an extension/plugin for this Messaging app... Zak Taccardi Hangouts is too advanced for a simple plugin. HoboJerk 1) You don't have to use it 2) It's an AOSP app(probably), so you don't need Gapps, and it's usable in China, etc. 3) You don't have to use it. Udayan Banerji One "why" I can think of is Google's need to get rid of the whole GMail / Google+ connotation of Hangouts. If you ask an average user (the sort who doesn't read Android Police, probably is using his first smartphone), he will not know what Hangouts is, or not understand that it can send SMS. He WILL know Messeging. Of course, very poorly executed by Google. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) what's the problem with hangouts?? Cheeseball It's closed source and currently slow when you have a spotty data connection (due to G+ integration). Disabling data makes it faster, but is a hassle to do that every other time. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Ah, I never knew that. I'm never in a bad connection and no wifi. I guess that can make sense. Cheeseball Hangouts is cool when you have a stable data/WiFi connection, but is complete crap when you have spotty data. This is due to the fact that it has to load anything related to G+ (e.g. profile pictures) when using the app. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) makes sense. thanks for going into more detail. I've asked why several times and all people say is "I hate hangouts" or "hangouts is crap" or "I don't like it because it sucks!" those answers don't help me to understand >_< Cheeseball Exactly. It's not that we hate Hangouts without reason, but because of the features that it lacks or the struggling performance. If it did work as fast as the stock/AOSP SMS/MMS app (regardless of an active internet connection), then I'm sure our complaints would be far less exorbitant. This is also why it gets compared a lot to iMessage on iOS as even on an unstable internet connection, iMessage quickly identifies whether to send a message through SMS or through the built-in iMessage service (blue or green Send button). The only problem is not being able to choose between SMS/iMessage (although I don't know if Apple changed this already). dxppxd This is not fragmenting messaging services, it's the ssms app for AOSP revamped. It's a good thing too, if hangouts replaces sms, then there would be no updated open source solution for a core function of telephony. I like hangouts, it's a good idea to have centralized messaging, but hate the execution. The lag that g+ integration forces on hangouts is enough to make me keep a separate app for sms every time. Arjit Mehra Looks neat! Mathieu M Byebye Hangouts Tom Erlandsen Red, blue AND yellow all on one page? That's too much material for me to handle right now braindead360 I still for the life of me cannot figure out why they do not just make these changes to Hangouts and run with it. ngo93 My thoughts exactly. The point of Hangouts was to unify messaging.. This messenger app, which is beautiful by the way, is a step backwards.. Tiago Pestana I really don't understand why google does this....like other user saying 5 days ago: "How about making Hangouts "a quick and easy way to send and receive SMS and MMS messages on Android" instead of creating more confusion?" cause i really enjoy hangouts, and i dont see any point on doing this Vlad Jurj Because Hangouts is not open sourced. This is the updated AOSP/stock app Björn Lundén Yes. People seem to have a really hard time grasping that important difference. Even if people never end up using it directly (though many likely will) it serves as a good base for OEMs to base their apps on. Clark DeVitis Then I really hope that the make Hangouts SMS/MMS functionality work this well, and make hangouts an even better option than this. Gerjannn If only Hangouts looked this beautiful.. Matches Malone They picked the most hideous shade of green for the latest version. morteum I downloaded the new messaging app. For some reason, it doesn't look as good as the pictures above make it seem. I don't love the hangouts UI, but I don't think this one is exponentially better. RockAndRock Where is the APK ? :P Desislav Iliev ^funny. If you wrote this 6 months ago BarelyBlurred https://plus.google.com/+MatthewBaer/posts/UWukwFB3ddt schoat333 I see a lot of hate for hangout, but I prefer it. Defenestratus For every person who complains about it, there are 10 others who have no problem with it. (Like me) someone755 I actually convinced a lot of people to try it. Now I have 30 people whose Hangouts online status is always on (compared to about a year ago when there were 2 people that occasionally logged onto GMail on their desktop). TheDrizzle The hard part is getting iOS users to use Hangouts. They are tied to iMessage. Lame. Jakob Bjerre Petersen I have actually had the most succes with that particular group of people. :) Paul I've managed to get my iOS-using family members to install Hangouts. But they're not Apple fanatics; they just want something that works. They know where I'm available -- in Hangouts -- so they use it to contact me, while using iMessage to contact each other. someone755 None of the people I talk to uses iOS. So I got that going for me, which is nice. Christopher Prats Everyone I know thinks that android is stupid and believe it has an ugly ui, well I guess they're enjoying their gingerbread era features and believe that android is slightly behind ui wise Christopher Prats They believe it looks like this Val Garcia same here, then i pull my rooted self designed android phone out, summoned ok google without touching the screen and their minds are blown away. seriously iOS's home screen is one of the ugliest interface I've seen another one is touchwiz and that one in your picture above Đức Thành I wouldn't say iOS is ugly as that's mostly subjective (though it kind of is to me, too), but it surely is unintuitive as heck. And that's the case even if we disregard the customization ability and use the device out of the box - maybe with lagwiz and everything, An Android device's still a lot more intuitive than iOS at this point. And that's comparing iOS 7 (I mean, does it matter which version of iOS we're using for comparison? They're all the same.) to friggin' ICS and Jelly Bean! When you put personal customization that fits your own habits into the equation, it's even more of a no brainer. And that's not to mention the glorious Lollipop. ynksbsbll2 I was able to convince my girlfriend to start using Hangouts on her iPhone. Next up: converting her to Android! Bilal Aahil Good luck with that mate XD Cthatguy Get her to use the glory of L - then there will be no turning back! Đức Thành You'd better wait till the official full release of Lollipop and set up everything ready for her to use on the new phone, do it in a way that's similar to her phone-using habits. The trap is set, once you do it right in luring her into getting used to the beautiful new OS, there's no escape. Tip: remember to install a shitload of Material Design Apps for her - as many as you can find, and simply leave it there for her to discover. Don't shove it in her face, do it in a subtle way but make sure they're easy for her to reach... Huehuehue. ...Sorry, somehow I'm getting excited like I'm the one doing the hunting myself. Deftdrummer This is a fucking weird comment on so many levels. Are you OK? Đức Thành I... I didn't know. I was only trying to be helpful.. Lisandro O Oocks iLamessage michael interbartolo I got my dad to use hangouts over normal texting from his iphone. it is good cause even the kids can hangout with papa now on their tablets. Alec Manning I got my grama to use hangouts on her iPad! blindexecutioner Doubtful. If that was the case this app would not be getting released. Michael This app is going into AOSP, which means it is a replacement for the old Messages app. Hangouts is a Google product and is not in AOSP. KG Great point!, I love hangouts as well... Hothfox Thank you, this. It's also why the caller ID function did not go out to any other phones but the Nexus - it was an exclusive feature, not in AOSP. qfv Eh? They killed the AOSP app in KK. The fact that their bringing it back clearly demonstrates that Hangouts sucks balls, for some people anyway. Michael They didn't kill the Messages app in KitKat. Its always been there. In Nexus devices, it isn't there because Nexus devices are not a pure Android experience, Nexus devices are a Pure Google Experience. Hangouts is a Google Experience app and Messages was not. This new app is replaces Messages because they wanted to incorporate Material Design into it so that more people would recognize it. It also gives choice to those that do not want to use Hangouts... But don't be mistaken, Google wants you to use Hangouts. Chroniq Actually, there is a great article on Ars Technica, written by Ron Amadeo, about Google's strategy on making multiple versions of everything. You might wanna check it up, it explains it very accurately: http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/10/googles-product-strategy-make-two-of-everything/ Alex "Doubtful." Well, going on the likes of his comment vs yours (5 vs 81 at the time of this posting), it looks closer to a 16 people to every 1 who complains. qb This site mostly features Google fanboys and Android enthusiasts. It hardly represents most Android users. Besides I agree with him, but I almost never bother voting for anyone's comment. jimv1983 The one thing I don't like about the Hangouts app is that it shows other contacts besides ones I have a mobile number for when I go to create a new message(I only use it for SMS). However, after the first week of using it I am always continuing existing conversations so it doesn't matter. Otherwise I like the Hangouts app. I will check out the new app too and use whenever I like best. lol Thank you for taking the time to yank that statistic out of your ass. Prasad Tiruvalluri I like hangouts and use it as my default messaging app. But I do not see any option to search my messages? Am I missing it or it is not there? Even my default Xperia Z1 messaging app has search option and I sometimes feel like going back to that.. roaduardo For every person who is satisfied with it, there are 10 others who prefer more customization options. That's one of the reasons for being on Android. Choices. Customization. Freedom. Victor Souza it's called "loud criers" I hate Hangouts too though qq Spoken like true Google fanboy. Abraham Williams Hangouts is awesome. It just needs a little more love. josuearisty What hangouts really needs is a better desing (like this messenger app) and make it easier to use (like this messenger app) I would like to filter and dont show my G+ contacts. Jem Ya, seriously. When I'm typing in a contact's name to text or message, I do _not_ want to have to filer through all my G+ contacts too! Ugh. There needs to be an option added where users can choose to include G+ contacts in Hangouts or not when typing in names! ClikFire _ I agree I like the look of this app better. This may Sound like Heresy but I actually think imessage on ios is the best looking sms app. Zep I believe it needs, a whole lotta love. ninjustin While I love hangouts, I still think it has some bugs to be worked out. For starters I don't always receive notifications for my hangouts/sms messages from it. Mastermind26 This. morteum I don't hate hangouts, but it leaves a lot to be desired. Few of my friends use it, so there isn't much of a point for me to use it over any other messenger app. The latest update feels really out of place to me, but the old UI was incredibly drab. It has the potential to be really awesome. They just need to market it more, crack down on OEMs to quit promoting their own shit over it, and give some more attention to the UI and functionality of the app. It should be more than iMessage ever was. It should be the easiest solution to messaging on any device for anyone. Rodrigo Santiago It's funny because many people already have a google account (gmail), and when I send a message through hangouts to some friends, they reaction is "omg wtf is this?" Rodrigo Santiago I agree with you. In hangouts I get an app that I can chat with someone in the phone, send and receive sms in the same conversation with that person, then I can continue that chat in the PC, without the need to install anything, just opening Gmail, but it's awfull? I really don't understand people at all. Of course it has some misbehaves, but, for me, they are minimal. QC With Whatsapp, for example, you can message people without making any account. All you do is install the app, it pulls your contacts from your phone and you can SMS/MMS them instantly, but Hangouts is better? I really don't understand people at all. eric10234 Yes and no. I use both Hangouts and Whatsapp. With Whatsapp, the lack of needing an account is a plus point. However, with Hangouts, any chats that I do on my phone, I can continue on my PC or vice versa. Also, when I switch phones, my Hangouts conversations sync over automatically while with Whatsapp, I would need to manually put in the chat history. So there are pros and cons with both. Rodrigo Santiago Well, if you have an android phone and access to google play store, tada, you have a google account. If you have gmail, tada, you have a google account. It's all you need to use hangouts. No, in WhatsApp you can't send SMS/MMS. You send text messages, it's not the same. No, in WhatsApp you can't chat in the PC without installing anything. Jiggs It is disgustingly laggy. Open whatsapp and open hangouts. The lag in hangouts is quite noticeable. And it is everywhere. When opening the app, sending a message, clicking on video call and call buttons, just everywhere. No wonder it hasn't had any significant adoption. KG Yes, I wish/hope this is fixed in future updates.... Wes A. Haque Looks like the hangouts app lags more when the dialer is installed. I really would like a search option in hangouts. Its 2014 for crying out loud. And where is the material design New Message floating button?? theiowakid This. Why no Search Goog? Why?!?! Peterson Silva As weird as it may sound, Whatsapp is "laggier" for me (is that a word? anyway) - Specially when typing, sometimes the keyboard will just freeze for 5 to 10 seconds. Really weird. But then again, I have an S3 Intl with CM11. Not exactly a flaghsip any longer :) Niall Murray Are you using swiftkey? Peterson Silva Yes! Niall Murray Try change your keyboard. swiftkey causes lag on whatsapp for me as well. Swaminathan Venkatesh This happens to me in my Note 2 & OPO as well.. Frustrating at times.. And I am using Google keyboard.. Matches Malone Probably your phone. WhatsApp never lags on my Nexus 5. hmmm Woah! Whatsapp doesnt lag on my GNex running Paranoid Android KK. There must be something wrong with your phone. Juan o.O whiners gunna whine, bitchers gunna bitch... Thats just how it is! Juan Asshole And assholes gunna asshole? VULGARCITO U mad bro? Need some kleenex to cry on the corner? Miles Reiter I hated it until the most recent update. The UI was always fine, but the UX left a lot to be desired in terms of consistency. brgulker It's missing things about texting that I want. Textra's quick replies and notifications are necessities for my purposes, and Hangouts has neither. It is also extremely laggy at times. I want a unified solution for SMS, MMS and... internet messages (don't know how to abbreviate those), but Hangouts just ain't it yet. Robert Daniels I wouldn't say I hate Hangouts, but SMSing did get a lot more efficient once I stopped using Hangouts for it. mantra2 Same page, this looks nice, but I have no plans to leave Hangouts. Works great and I do much more chatting via Hangouts than I do via SMS. ClikFire _ I like this better personally never really liked hangouts at all. Negative287 Hangouts sucked because it forced the whole ecosystem of Google Plus on you to send a picture in a message. Allo isn't any better in this regard. enoch861 Looks exactly like Textra. IamTheFij Yep. This is why the whole Textra vs. QKSMS controversy was stupid. They are both nothing more than a material themed messaging app. There is pretty much one way to do that if you follow the guidelines. Pavel Sikun WHY DA HELL THEY DON"T MAKE IMESSAGES CLONE ALREADY?? Make an invisible relay - send the message via internet by default and if there's no connection - automatically resend it using sms. Really, Google, stop bitching around, do the thing all users really want! Defenestratus You realize how much iMessage pisses off people who have to chat with people who own iPhones but don't have iPhones themselves? Especially those who have android phones but also iPads that "stay on" during the day on the nightstand? Talk to my buddy Bob who missed a bunch of SMS/iMessages from his sister that his poor mother was sent to the emergency room but because of iMessage, he didn't find out about it until he got home and turned on his iPad to find all of those messages sitting there for him. [email protected] I hate crapple so much. Pavel Sikun They can always make "check delay", so if user haven't checked internet-sent message in like a minute - then system should re-send this message via sms. If they'd want to, they can make it to work logically and correct. brgulker Whatever happened to picking up the phone and making a phone call? I feel bad for your friend. That's awful all around. But sometimes, you just gotta make the phone call. EowynCarter I don't want that. I want my phone to send an sms when I say sms. I usually use sms on purpose, because I expect the receiver to be in a place with no data. digiblur Why oh why do they continue to force these white backgrounds. Blinding to read at night... Danny365 I wonder why they chose to use different looking on/off switch in this app. CoreRooted That's Material Design. Daniel Smith I hope the attachments are sent over Google and not MMS. CoreRooted MMS messages are still sent via your carrier. jpelgrom Why hasn't anyone mentioned the new AP logo yet (watermark in images)? (probably because we've seen it so much already) Pascal Welsch Useless. I don't write SMS. Mlibbey Usless, for you. TAINT_BUTTHOLE That's a real cool story bro. Brandon Jiang And I suppose smartphones are useless, because there are still billions who don't have one? #logic brgulker Much like this comment, then? power_pizza I hate the latest version of Hangouts. The previous version worked great for me. I don't care about google voice but I like using Gchat to sync across my devices. I want to call people from Hangouts using old fashioned phone service but now Hangouts dials my contacts using Google Voice without giving me the option to change it back. Boo. jscofi when you are in a chat with someone, and you click the phone icon, it pops up prompting you to call the person(using gvoice). However, if you tap the Normal looking phone next to the Hangouts icon, it dials the number from your SIM phone # trwnh Not everyone loves Hangouts integration. My mom absolutely CANNOT function with having her SMS in Hangouts. She needs it to be separate, so she always knows 100% where a message is being sent from. She doesn't ever want to send a message to Hangouts when she meant to text, and she doesn't ever want to use texts with international numbers unless she wants to, and typing someone's name opens Hangouts by default, which she doesn't like. Cesar I love how it changes theme color depending on the avatar of the person in the conversation. I wonder how it handles someone you actually do have a picture for though. Victor Souza just like Contacts, it choses a color automatically based on the person's pic there's orange, pink, gray, blue and green Leeroy Jenkins Someone on Google+ commented that, because Google wants to sell the Nexus 6 through US carriers, they required a standart SMS app. As carriers want to promote their own texting plans and not promote people to use Hangouts, Whats app etc. This sound very likely to me. Artmem replied something along the lines of "never underestimate the carriers greed to make money". Does that make sense? gab_gagnon Apple can easily push iMessage into carrier's throats. Why can't Google do the same? Zak Taccardi iMessage is easy to implement because they only care about supporting it for iOS devices, which all run the same software. The logic is this: "If user sends message to other iOS user, use iMessage instead of SMS" - remember with iMessage, both users are using the Apple messaging app. In Android it's not so simple. Apple can do what they want because if the carriers have a problem with it, Apple won't offer their phone on their service. If Google doesn't do what Verizon wants, their is plenty of other Android competition out there that Verizon doesn't need to cater to Google. gab_gagnon Thanks for the clear and respectful answer! braindead360 Apple holds about 42% of the smartphone market. While Androids market share is higher, you have to remember that this is a result of dozens of devices being sold by different companies, leaving several weak points for negotiation. If the carriers decided to play dirty and force the OEM's hands, they could put pressure on them to fork Android into their (the carriers') own visions of how smartphones should operate. Spoilers, we don't want that. I doubt they would do something like that over something as petty as messaging, but then again, they've arguably done stupider things. morteum Probably because of the sheer popularity and power of the iPhone. The Nexus line is awesome to some, but has never been a huge hit compared to the iPhone. If Google wanted to ensure the Nexus 6 was on all carriers they probably had to make a few compromises. A carrier can get away with not carrying the Nexus 6 easily. The iPhone, on the other hand, would be hard to pass up. Fatal1ty_93_RUS $$$$ <--- this is why braindead360 That makes sense to some extent, but I still think it is ridiculous. Data is the new cash cow on the block, and I would think that anything they could do to get people to use more of it, hence need to buy more of it, would be optimal towards maximizing profits. Hell, I would imagine that nearly everyone, outside of a handful of people clutching on to their unlimited plans have unlimited messaging grouped into their plans. brgulker User experience still matters. When I was out of town for a week in a place with spotty data connections, I had no idea why Hangouts was acting up so much (I was using it for SMS at the time as well). Only after the fact did I learn how heavily Hangouts relies on data even when you don't think you "need" it, e.g., to send a text. blindexecutioner These third parties should stop blaming carriers for everything "evil" Google does. Leeroy Jenkins Sure, I agree, It's just a thesis of what's going on, the true reason, only Mountain-view knows. Leonardo Baez Lots of sense... Miguel Vega Well I think is time for Google to start imposing itself and it policies like Apple do. You dont need any freaking carriers approval when they update or when they add any other features. The carriers have to adapt to Apple not the other way around. I am an android fan just in case btw. brgulker But Google can't do this. They just don't have the leverage Apple does. Miguel Vega Well Apple net worth is about 286 billion and Google 328 billion approximate. 51.5% of all phones sales in the us are android 42.8% Iphones also Google is the most widely used search engine. I think they have about or more leverage if they want to impose themselves. I think they just dont care. Prosper Bluff Check a couple posts up.. Someone explains this: (Here, let me quote) "Apple can do what they want because if the carriers have a problem with it, Apple won't offer their phone on their service. If Google doesn't do what Verizon wants, their is plenty of other Android competition out there that Verizon doesn't need to cater to Google." Thats the gist of it.. The carriers don't care about your company's worth and such.. Just how much money they can make off of, or without you :/ ThoFeelExp That context specific colour adaptability is futuristic Walkop The Contacts app on Lollipop has it too, AP hasn't covered that yet. perhac88 Tried it earlier on my Nexus 5 (stock). Love the way it looks, but after every text I sent the keyboard would freeze for about 3 seconds Alijah Simon Need I remind you fine fuckers that Google has Material planned for all its apps? Here's Google's own rendition of Hangouts back from IO (next to the pantyhose-grey version): Here's to Material Design. *Clink* Brayjr No pic? Cesar Refresh. Brayjr Ah... Fatal1ty_93_RUS Looks quite shitty honestly, I hope final version will be completely different from this spacemonkey82 this is the reason why an average user find android confusing - why the hell introduce messenger when hangouts works perfectly fine. TAINT_BUTTHOLE To reduce confusion, obviously. Leonardo Baez Because it dont work perfectly for everyone. Most oldest users find it confusing. Blake Choice doesn't need to be confusing. brgulker My experience was exactly the other way around. I tried to explain that Hangouts was an internet based service that could incorporate blank stares to my parents and in laws, and I got blank stares back. So, we they just keep using SMS, and they are not confused at all. SMS works just fine for most people. Marcel Ulbrich That might be the case in the US, over here, SMS are expensive, every single text would cost me 20cents, MMS would start at about 80cents with crappy 30kb pictures, which is why SMS died about 2-3 years ago and MMS were a non-starter for most. People have been used to resorting to Internet messaging back in the ICQ days and don't have to put up with the carriers' ridiculous charges. Nwarrior Look at the colors used in this app. The touchwiz preview looked a lot better than these colors, yet the fanboys went wild. Dear god those are ugly color combinations. Dr. Giygas Devereaux If they didn't update the AOSP messaging app, there would be people complaining about Google abandoning open source. But now that they did, apparently that means they're ignoring/abandoning Hangouts. Damned if they do, damned if they don't. person You know that there are many people and they have differing opinions, right? rmkilc What is the star in the status bar?? TAINT_BUTTHOLE Indicator for Android Starburst. rmkilc Seems legit. TAINT_BUTTHOLE Totally. Kehnin Dyer Priority notification mode is active. Oliver Phillips It signifies you are in 'Priority mode', which you can select from the volume overlay in Lollipop. It only lets certain notifications through for a set amount of time: http://imgur.com/h7CRVln deepak Pls pls pls add an easy way to share contacts! nathanielbaratta I understand that not everyone uses hangouts, but for the most part people that get a nexus phone use it. I, personally, will continue to use hangouts for all messaging when I get my N6, hopefully hangouts gets a nice material update and still supports the integration of texts. Leonardo Baez You will have the 2 apps and you can choose wich one will be the default... Isnt that great? sch31 Looks great but they should really starting encrypting messages. I have a feeling I'll have to wait a long time for that feature. Always textsecure tho :) blindexecutioner Can you customize which color the contact circles are? I'd absolutely hate my wife getting red assigned to her. Very few of my contacts use real pictures. Leonardo Baez You must add the picture in your contact entry Oliver Phillips I think this is the AOSP app Pororo APK? https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0ImwqTxo-neN3RYTU8weG1CN1k/view blindexecutioner Off topic but what's the star next to the wifi icon? Pororo Priority notification. Press your volume button. u will know what i mean. ^^ The Dude So instead of standardizing on Hangouts, Google creates more fragmentation, more confusion. Just make Hangouts the default on every phone! I already have a hard time convincing people to use it because its not the default messaging app. Minhaj Tahsin Ahmed So what color it inherits when the contact has a picture? RahjerDat I think it depends on whether or not they have Hangouts. My girl texted me and the color was green. My friend texted me from an iPhone and the color was blue. They both have pics. Oliver Phillips I think it's based on the predominant colour in the picture. My (redheaded) sister shows up as quite a bright orange Mastermind26 Seems an awful lot like textra layout....or is it the other way around???? Yury Andratsion Messenger? YouNex Apk https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8Q9z2mAd85kdUZheC05SHZxT0E/preview Blayze04 I don't understand why Google hasn't implemented in this or Hangouts a why to quick reply to messages from the notification area. Fatal1ty_93_RUS This is what hangouts should have fucking been since the beggining instead of that rushed POS we have now LUIS FLORES This actually looks a lot like textra Swaginator Uh, Textra anyone? Bigzitta They need to add contact sharing in this app yungqb7 I hope that all of this gets implemented in the next major revision of hangouts kishan I don't understand. Why can't they just improve on Hangouts instead of creating another freaking app? Fatal1ty_93_RUS Because google miri Some people don't like, or find it confusing to use the Hangouts app for regular text messages. Rage4Order While I like Hangouts, I think Google just generally went wrong with it. Instead of making Hangouts a separate messaging application which also handles SMS/MMS, they should have made the default messaging app modular, where Hangouts could function as a plug-in. I.e.potentially make it work exactly the same way that the new Hangouts dialer adds itself into the Hangouts app, but make the whole Hangouts app a module of a unified stock Android messaging app. That way, a user could use a single messaging app to handle all their messaging/video calling needs, but it would not be forcing Hangouts onto those who don't want to use it. With some clever programming, they could even make it intertwine the SMS and Hangout messages the same way iMessage does on iPhone. The current solution on Nexus 5 is confusing and not exactly intuitive, because you have to go into Hangouts to send a non-hangouts message. That's just a bad design idea. Yan Gabriel Minário See, Google? Make it happen. brgulker Not a developer, so no idea if this is doable, but this sure makes sense. Majeed Hamid My question is, is google trying to implement whatsapp like here? if so , then looked a good start to me lol brgulker like Gmail for when your inbox is empty, Yep, never had an empty Gmail inbox. brgulker Looks a lot like Textra. Dagmar Schneitz What do you expect? There's a lot of hate many places online. Lars Jeppesen "Messenger" ?? really? Didn't Mickeysoft use the same name for their chat client?? I remember using MS Messenger for a lot of time.. back in the days everybody and their girlfriend were on dat shite... Scott C Would love if it backed up sms to google and auto downloaded to a new phone. How hard is this to implement. Phantom Why are thenav bars black? they look bad, they should be tinted like the notification bar. duse I love how it includes a search function and Hangouts never has since day one. And now every change/improvement they want to make to the SMS experience needs to be done in two apps (or, more likely, in just one app and the other will be left to rot). They can't get anything right. aouniat Why not update hangouts with new features such as voice clips in stead of releasing a new app ? !!!! Michael Jones I'm sure some people will love this but I still prefer hangouts to this. One app to do hangouts and SMS is great for people like me who don't like having a million apps. I already have to use several chat apps because so many friends either use facebook messenger, whatsapp, snapchat, etc, so any way to reduce the number of apps and retain same functionality is great. This will probably be removed by me via TI backup Bilal Aahil I kinda like this app, very simple, Hangouts have its own functionality but this should do just fine for the basic use. Tony Hope MMS will actually send on this. Have so many problems with MMS and Android. aSquard MMS sends for me with the Messenger app as well as hangouts (LPX13D) Toinou Tried it, not bad. I'll keep using Textra though, it's better. Deeco I. Just. Don't. Understand! James Keleman Does anyone have a link or can post the apk? I tried downloading from Google drive and it says there is an error and can't download. Someone help! qbix I can't understand why "strip unicode" is not a default feature. I guess I'll have to wait until Cyanogen fixes that. hyperbolic This is really confusing. What happens with Hangouts ? is it staying ? or perhaps they both stay ? Confusing... les02jen17 No dual-sim support? Come on, Google! Alfisti I feel something has been missed here. Why can't we have a messaging/phone app that integrates all communication ie. Phone calls, txts, email with the addition of integrating messaging apps like whatsapp, viber etc. So you would have all communication threads essentially in one place. That really would be incredible Simon Belmont I have to say that I'd love for Hangouts to adopt the dynamic coloring scheme. That's really neat. Secondly, why does this messaging app have the ability to record sound and send it, but Hangouts STILL can't? I've been resorting to taking videos with no video (just audio) to send sounds to friends. Finally, I'd love to be able to quickly reply to a text right from the notification at the top of the screen. I'm sure Google could pull this off. blah yes, i can't believe i can't send audio clips in hangouts. Guest Hangouts is alright, i would prefer something more like this. ClikFire _ So can you use this instead of Hangouts as your Default SMS? Andy J The question is - is it a Wear friendly app? Jose Romero Don't like the yellow FAB. Jacqui I love hangouts too. Use it as my default SMS app. Only one complaint, before the last update you could swipe a conversation to archive it. Doesn't seem to work anymore. Only way I see to archive is in the conversation. Guillaum Gibault Ok, recently I just convinced some people to use Hangouts as sms app because of its versatility (mobile, pc, mac, tablet, video chat, etc.), and now Google bring a brand new sms app that seems more integrated and polish for Lollipop and promote it more than Hangouts itself. So confused... Dan Caseley Glad I'm not the only one using hangouts. I'm confused by all the hate. Anyone explain the issues with the app? Guillaum Gibault Google should put all their efforts on Hangouts instead refreshing the other SMS app which seemed dead for months. thisphuckinguy I wonder if this will be only available on the N6. baifern it kinda lags when scrolling through list of contacts thisorthat27 Maybe u can tap the delete old messages area and choose when and how they get deleted jdrch Don't see anything that would make me leave mySMS. Walter Black The fact that I won't be getting the android L update till like APRIL or later and it releases in November is one of the main reasons I'm getting an IPhone 6 in two weeks. Salut' 👋 gnaLor Google should rename and redesign the hangouts app into exactly this one, but keep all features (video chat, desktop app, sms), and offer it on iOS (like already) and also Windows Phone. A google+ account should not be mandatory, a normal google account is enough. This way, they will make it as or even more powerfull as the very good facebook messenger, but without the need of facebook (which some dont like) and already preinstalled on all androids. And actually people will be easy to convince since it's preinstalled and already in use as their sms app. bjmy Hoooray! Messaging is back. Now I can uninstall my third party app, along with with shitty Hangouts. Woo Have all the Hangouts fans considered the fact that many people dont want a "unified" solution? I dont use Google+ or GTalk, so those are useless to me. I dont live in the US, so Google Voice is useless to me. That leaves me with SMS/MMS. And I'm happy to finally have an app that lets me do just that. Kahroo Would be cool if I could use my GVoice number with this app. Khan Ermmm, please change those colours, PLEASE! YELLOW RED AND BLUE?? Stuff that sh!t! Clark DeVitis Will Hangouts get lots of sweet features like this app? (the voice memos and stuff) Steven Webb Am I missing something? What's wrong with hangouts? It has full SMS integration. If you don't want to use hangouts messaging, you don't have to. kaiz charaniya It looks a lot like Textra which android users already have access to meelyg there's a simple problem with this & almost every google app. zero customizability. these apps have virtually no settings to customize appearance which is a real shame TEKNISK FEIL How can I make messenger my default notifications app? Tried where it says make default, disabled samsung's messages, but Hangout, that I use for calls, keep stealing focus, and I have to set messenger as default every day. Works perfectly when open, writing back and forth. But still on incomming sms, when messenger is not in use, Hangouts pops up in notifications, I forget, touch it, and there I am, back in Hangouts. quitquit Anyone notice that there are no quick reply/delete/read options in the notification for messenger? No expandable notification? Deal-breaker for me. Chris Any ideas why my contact pictures from Facebook won't show up in the app? I just get the letter of their first name... kristijan Any solution to this? Still trying to figure it out. Ryan Patrick McAvoy This app STILL has a million problems with downloading group messages >_> eddie I love it.... But how to get notifications on my gear s?! I'm frustrated Doni How do I get rid of the ugly arse ORANGE theme in a message?

This is even as Truecaller and Google  come together to improve video calling for millions. The strategic agreement  is expected to integrate Google Duo, a high quality video calling service, within the Truecaller app. This will add a crucial communications layer that strengthens the value of Truecaller’s wildly popular dialer, caller ID, and spam blocking app already used by more than 250 million users globally.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 100 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ?

Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off. Rest of the settings are stock out of the box. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d6d107fe72843084747728a2ff7d6ed0c69dbb8828498d680a8e574909c8d80.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/69216e0f531ae12996c1fea6d785844e4b1d5cb6f74e5a1f1b39973b6d6f25d5.png Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Opinion: Electron Is Flash For The Desktop 5 Uses For Gmail Beyond Sending Boring Old Regular Emails David Nield Apr 23, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  email gmail google Share Even if you don't personally use Gmail, someone you know does. The service is perfect for people who need an email address independent of their work one, and a far better alternative than security nightmares like YahooMail. Yet Gmail, despite the name, isn't just a great platform for email. Image: Alex Knight/Unsplash/Google Gmail makes use of the cloud, just like Dropbox or Google Drive, to store all your emails. Only you have a lot more space in Gmail than you would in a traditional cloud storage drive. That means that with a little ingenuity you can use Gmail for a whole host of other tasks. 1) Taking notes Image: Screenshot All hail the drafts folder (or label), that purgatorial part of Gmail where emails aren't sent but just left in limbo...for eternity. This is a great place to jot down snippets, thoughts, to do lists, ideas, and anything else you want to make a note of temporarily. Remember that you can get at your drafts from anywhere you've got Gmail installed, so your notes go with you everywhere, and of course you've got Gmail's advanced search features to take advantage of too. You can even attach files to your drafts as well. 2) Sending your files to the cloud Image: Screenshot Gmail works wonderfully well with IFTTT (If This Then That), a platform we've talked about many times before, and one way you can utilise this is by having Gmail attachments automatically saved to your Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, or Box accounts. Why would you do this via Gmail? It lets you upload files from anywhere you can send an email (like someone else's computer) without installing any other apps, and it also means you can save files to multiple connected cloud services at the same time. 3) Updating all your social media accounts at once Image: Screenshot This is another IFTTT one and a bit of a cheat, because it works with any email service, not just Gmail. If you send an message to a specified IFTTT address, you can post an update to all your social media accounts at once, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others. As you can get at email pretty much everywhere, you can update your social media accounts from everywhere, and there's even the option to upload pictures via email attachments. The posts will use your default privacy settings when they hit Facebook. 4) Making a private photo album Image: Screenshot Google makes it fairly easy for users to have multiple Gmail accounts, so you can set up a dedicated Gmail space for a private photo collection that only a few people have access to. The obvious use is a closed off album of baby pictures for interested friends and family. Anyone can then email over photos to the shared account, with custom labels and subject headers available to organise everything. Some of Gmail's potential for photo storage has been negated by the arrival of Google Photos, but it's still a nice alternative. 5) Keeping a diary Image: Screenshot Gmail isn't the most advanced word processor in the world, but it does have a few features in its favour, like text formatting, support for embedded images, and the various apps that let you access your account from just about any device, from iPhones to Chromebooks. It's also particularly handy for keeping a diary, because you can create new entries with new emails, and organise everything in conversation threads and through Gmail's labelling system. Your diary entries can be easily searched and printed out as well. Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

I have been (ab)using the draft feature for ages, its really useful for all sorts of things, I have a few hundred things in there at the moment. I also email myself documents and photos all the time with keywords in them so I can search my mail for them if i need them later. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

The Samsung Chromebook Plus proves them wrong thanks to great hardware, a beautiful touchscreen and the S Pen. It also runs Android apps well. That’s why we listed it as one of the best Chromebooks of 2017. Students will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus because the S Pen, normally found only on the Galaxy Note phones and tablets, makes taking notes easy. Owners can read and write with less eye strain, thanks to the great screen. The Samsung Chromebook Plus feels small enough to carry from class to class and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy some entertainment back in the dorm later that night. These same reasons mean business users will enjoy taking it on the road and using it for work and play. In fact, most consumers will love the Chromebook Plus. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Touchscreen The 12.3-inch touchscreen on the Samsung Chromebook plus excels at almost every category of evaluation. It’s bright and comfortable to use even in bright settings. I used it at 50% most of the time, which also extends the already great battery life. The colors on the display look nice and the high-resolution displays text clearly with crisp sharp quality. It’s easy to read using the screen even for long times. Controlling the computer using touch in laptop mode feels more comfortable now that we’re getting used to touchscreens. I hate that my MacBook doesn’t let me scroll quickly with a flick of my finger on a touchscreen. Once you get used to the quick motion, you miss it on devices without one. We’ll look at the S Pen below. The palm rejection helps note takers and artists in the right apps. The system works so much better than my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil or any other active or passive stylus setup. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Hardware Design The computer looks almost like a square with 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ dimensions. It’s not square, but looks it and that’s a good thing when using touch or the pen. the 3:2 aspect ratio seems more natural for a tablet. Samsung gave the Chromebook Plus an aluminum chassis. The textured surface on the lid and around the keyboard feels nice and looks great. It’s also super thin and sleek. The bezel around the display gives the user enough space to hold the computer in tablet mode. Its hinges give enough stability without making it hard to open and close. The combo headphone/mic audio jack sits on the back left edge closest to the screen. There’s also a USB-C 3.1 port next to that and a micro-SD card reader with a door that covers it. The right edge holds the S Pen silo closest to the screen. Next we get the second USB-C port, the power button and LED status light and volume up/down rocker buttons. Both USB-C ports will charge the computer. The 2-in-1 convertible design means you have the option of using the Chromebook as a traditional laptop plus tent mode as seen above or stand mode. Bend the screen back so that you can lay the keyboard facing down on a table and use just the screen with touch or the S Pen as seen below. Samsung Chromebook Plus: S Pen Keyboard and Trackpad The input devices on the Samsung Chromebook Plus mostly add to the devices quality. The S Pen works with the screen to create a great writing experience. We get the best palm rejection using apps that support it, like my favorite Android note-taking app Squid, formerly Papyrus.  Metamoji Note is another great Android note-taker. Other active digitizer pens let users rest their palms on the screen, but some of them don’t work as well as the S Pen on the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The S Pen supports pressure sensitivity and writes or draws smoothly. Slide it into the silo on the right side of the keyboard to stow it. Don’t worry. It can’t go in wrong, so you won’t damage it like the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Speaking of older Samsung S Pens, I miss the buttons that give the user a right-click. The spacious and responsive trackpad sits below the keyboard and doesn’t get in the way. I didn’t accidentally touch it with my palm while typing. The keyboard feels a little mushy, but I got used to it quickly. Typing on it accurately isn’t difficult after getting used to the feel. It’s narrower than a typical keyboard, which also takes time to adjust to. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Performance and Battery Life The performance seems great. The computer scored 9159 on Octane, a useful benchmarking website. That’s a decent score when running the benchmark over a slow public Wi-Fi hotspot. Other computers that run on an Intel processor will smoke the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The ARM processor in the Samsung Chromebook Plus runs quickly compared to other ARM Chromebooks. It reboots in seconds and apps jump to fill the screen. Open a dozen tabs in Chrome before it really slows down. Even though the Chromebook generally runs quickly, it suffers one problem. Closing the lid and letting it sleep, then opening it often causes it to freeze and reboot within about 30 minutes. I’m not the only one with the problem. A Reddit thread includes a bunch of other owners with the same or similar issues. A few of those in the thread replaced their Chromebook and didn’t experience problems with their second machine. I fixed this problem with a total reinstall of the operating system. Look for a How To post on that very soon. Until then, use Google’s help site, which explains how to download ChromeOS onto a USB flash drive or card and then restore the OS using recovery mode. This forces a fresh install, which downloads the OS and reinstalls it from a flash drive or SD card. Since then, the freezes have gone away. The battery of the Samsung Chromebook Plus lasts longer than most. Notice in the screenshot above that with 85% battery life left, the OS estimates about 8:23 until it runs out of power. I’ve used the Chromebook for as long as 2 hours at a time and it typically drops by only 15% resulting in about 12-14 hours of use depending on usage and screen brightness. The screen stays at about 50%. Users may not want to use the Samsung Chromebook Plus for multimedia, like streaming music or viewing videos online, unless they plan to hook up headphones or external speakers. The downward facing speakers pump very little volume. In a moderately loud environment, you have to boost volume 100% to tell that sound is coming out. With decent external speakers, playing through an HDMI TV with good speakers or hooking up a nice set of headphones fixes the problem. That is how most people listen to audio on a laptop anyway. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Software ChromeOS powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus with a new addition: the Google Play Store and Android apps. Before Google added the Play Store, the Chromebook seemed so simple. Users can load Chrome Apps (see the Chrome Web Store above) that run in Chrome browser or a window that may not look like Chrome, but still is. If you want to reset the Chromebook, just run something called a Powerwash. This erases the Chromebook and reinstalls the operating system. You log back in with your Google account and within a few minutes all the apps and settings come to life. Adding Android apps makes this Powerwash process a little more complicated, especially if you run Android apps that need a lot of setting up or must download files to work, like my Bible apps. Google partially fixed the problem by automatically downloading most of the apps installed on the Chromebook before the Powerwash. In spite of the added complexity of Android apps, running a Chromebook got a lot more interesting after Google added the Play Store. I don’t install all the apps that I run on the Google Pixel XL. A lot of those apps do things that a user can do inside Chrome as well or better. However, a few of the best Android apps find a fitting home on ChromeOS. Microsoft doesn’t let users install the mobile Word, PowerPoint and Excel apps on any screen larger than 10-inches. That means no Android versions of these apps on my Chromebook. You have to run the online versions instead. That’s the only Android app I miss. The rest of my apps work fine on the device. You can install the apps by side loading them, but that’s not for the beginning user. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Specs Hexa-core Dual Arm Cortex A72 2GHz Processor 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB eMMC storage Model Number – XE513C24-K01US 12.3-inch LCD Touchscreen Display with 2400 x 1600 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio and 400 nit brightness 2-in-1 rotating display Shared integrated graphics 2 1.5watt stereo speakers facing down 720p webcam 802.11ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with Marvell 88W997 wireless card Bluetooth 4.0 Headphone mic combo audio port 2 USB-C 3.1 ports (up to 5Gbps and 4K display output with optional adapter) 1 micro-SD card slot Spill resistant 74-key keyboard S Pen 2-cell Li-ion 5140mAh batter with 39 watt hours Dimensions – 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ Weight – 2.38lbs The Bottom Line Samsung makes the best Chromebook money can buy. It will get better when they release the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which adds an Intel Core M processor making it faster, but reducing battery life. The Samsung Chromebook Plus includes the excellent S Pen with great palm rejection while writing or drawing. The bright and sharp screen displays text, video and images beautifully and lets users turn down brightness to extend the already great battery life. I experienced freezes and frequent crashes at first. However, the problem seems isolated and a swap at the store or reinstalling the OS should fix the problem. Let’s hope Samsung can find out what’s wrong and fix it with an update. The mushy narrow keyboard might cause some to struggle as they type. I’ve got big hands and got used to the size and the feel of the keys after a couple days. At $449, or on sale at Best Buy for $419 in April 2017 or $369 for students until May 6, the price might cause some potential buyers to pause since other Chromebooks cost as low as $200. None of those cheaper machines comes with the great S Pen or excellent screen. Few offer battery life as long as the Samsung Chromebook Plus.   4 Responses 04/15/2017 Michael Perry Reply Thanks for a very nice review. I have the Samsung Chromebook Plus and have been using it for about two weeks now having purchased at a reduced cost from Amazon Prime. The things I enjoy are the fun I get from it installing new games and seeing how they run. I have had good luck with so many different games like SimCity Buildit and Shadowmatic. I wish they would fix the immersive screen and allow a switch in the on screen keyboard to turn this on. I have not sideloaded the MS apps since most of my docs are google docs. I do have OfficeSuite Pro installed which seems to be set up for chromebooks and it has support for OneDrive and Google Drive which is nice. It also runs quite well on the Plus and allows editing and saving of word, powerpoint, and excel files. Its worth “noting” that OneNote is present and can be installed. The screen ratio and brightness is something which has amazed me a few times. This is a nice small form factor laptop hybrid thing and I have used it in tablet, tent, and laptop. I have not used the touch screen that much in non tablet modes. I will experiment with that. I did load almost all the apps on my Pixel and as I mentioned I love trying new games that come out to see how they play. I am not a demanding gamer but its fun to see them run in full screen or immersive mode on the Plus. I wish Google would make the tablet form factor a bit easier but the S-pen makes it nicer. There are so many nice touches with the Plus! I am planning a long trip to Asia later in the year and will be taking the Plus with the select group of Android apps plus Skype or another SIP client to make calls. 04/15/2017 oldman65 Reply Great review. However I scored 10080 with octane 2 when my Samsung plus is connected to a socket, and I replaced Microsoft Office by Google Office ( Suite) long long time ago and never missed it. Most Web applications are great with a Chromebooks but having the possibility to run Android applications is definitevely a plus. 04/18/2017 PC Reply Question, how is the S PEN lag? Earlier reviewers were sent a Chromebook Pro from Samsung and many commented that there was a noticeable lag between the ink appearing and your writing. Also how low can you turn down the brightness as I like to do writing at night in a low light. I was considering the Lenovo Yoga Book, because of the feature of using real ink and paper on top of the HALO surface area. 04/22/2017 Gary Reply Don’t expect Apple Pencil level latency performance. There is noticeable lag, so you will have to compensate and write slower/carefully for your writings to appear as they would on actual paper. It also depends on the software of course, but I would say the level of lag is about same as Surface Pens. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Still, there is one specific market niche, where Google's brainchild really reigns supreme. And a pretty important and prospective one at that. At the end of last year, Chromebooks comprised a whopping 49% of the K-12 education sector, up from 40% in 2015 and only 9% in 2013. Clearly the web giant is on to something and is seems Cupertino wants in. Windows Central recently obtained some insider information, hinting that Microsoft's upcoming May 2 event, will see the release of a new cloud-based variant of Windows 10. One designed specifically to take Chrome OS head on in the classroom. Rumors suggest it will go by the name "Windows 10 S" and that it is thankfully a lot closer to Microsoft's current Universal Windows Platform apps and advanced cloud services, than the company's last misguided attempts at budgets ARM-based solutions - the dreaded Windows RT. Judging by the minimum specs sheet, as well as some additional leaked info, Windows 10 S indeed appears to be intended for standard x86 PC hardware and should run on the unified Windows 10 kernel. This theory is further backed up by the fact that it is said to offer an upgrade path to Windows 10 Home or Pro, through the purchase of an additional license. Microsoft's game plan here will be to offload a lot of tasks from the machine on to the cloud, just like Google does with its Chrome OS. This shouldn't be hard either, since Microsoft's lineup of cloud services, like OneDrive and Office 365 have really come a long way. If Cupertino plays its cards right, it could benefit from the long-standing Windows compatibility and versatility arguments as well. Not only is Win32 compatibility for regular desktop applications possible with this approach, but the company's ongoing push towards the UWP model has created tools like Desktop Bridge, or "Project Centennial", for easy migration and running of older code in Microsoft's new ecosystem. And if the US giant is at all serious in its plans to take on Chrome OS in the K-12 realm, this push towards the more streamlined and manageable UWP format needs to become even harder. One of the main reasons Google has been so successful and popular for the particular K-12 use case has always been simplicity to both operate and manage Chrome OS with ease. Teachers, professors and other educators and IT support staff benefit just as much from having a user-friendly experience on the administrative end of the ecosystem. Remote lockups and assistance, strict content control, seamless data transfer are all things Microsoft needs to personally supervise under the UWP flag, so Windows S doesn't get drowned in the sea that is traditional Widows support. But, we digress. Circling back to the May 2 event, some industry insiders hope to see interesting K-12 hardware offers on stage as well. Most speculations seem to revolve around a cheaper laptop-style device, with a non-detachable keyboard, economical enough to make and sell in mass. Still, just like a Surface tablet, it will most likely have a touch screen and perhaps even a stylus. Also, a Lenovo Youga-style hinge setup to properly utilize touch input. Still, others believe Microsoft will hold off on any potential hardware announcements until its Build conference, the following week. Even if that doesn't come to pass and Microsoft decides to rely on third-party compatible hardware offers instead of ones under its own Surface brand, Windows 10 S still holds a lot of potential.

New Level 4 Local Guides for Google Maps will no longer receive free 100GB of Drive storage Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/03 7:30pm PDTMar 3, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 120 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Google News Local Guides is a program by Google Maps in which you "help others explore the world and get great benefits in return" (Google's words, not mine). Well, it looks like those great benefits are about to become merely average benefits, as Google is completely ditching free Drive storage for new Level 4 Local Guides, who currently get 100GB for one year. This removal of free Drive storage as a reward follows a similar event from back in July of 2016, when the promo for new Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. When that happened, we assumed that Google Maps was having too many people reach Level 4 too quickly; the same thing is probably applicable here. Here's Google's explanation: As our global community of Local Guides continues to grow, we occasionally make changes to our program. We look forward to offering our most active and consistently-contributing Local Guides more features and perks throughout the year. Not all hope is lost, though; if you're a Local Guide, you'll still receive your free 100GB if you reach Level 4 prior to March 17th at 11pm EST. As someone who's recently gotten into this whole thing, I'm probably going to be adding to my current 63 points (Level 3) quite rapidly in the span of the next two weeks.

Just reached Level 4 last week! :) mchalakov I still have my 1TB for one more year Steven Kelby Me too, but then what do we do? Forced to buy a pixel phone I guess. Or pay $125 per year. Ramon Or delete shit..Storage with expired dates shouldn't be a thing. Steven Kelby Yeah it's a trap. What a scam. JG $125 for a year doesn't sound all that bad... Though your a little high... If you buy a whole year, it's only $99.99 ($9.99/month if you pay per month). Though I really don't need a whole terabyte (right now I'm only using 1.09GBs of my 1TB+19GB)... I may go for the $19.99/year for 100GBs though... Steven Kelby I'm in Australia so it costs more here, that's AUD. I guess it's not too bad but a hard drive is much cheaper. Just need to have it networked off site at a friends house in case the house burns down! Vlad What if there's an earthquake and both your houses fall down? Steven Kelby Hopefully I'll get squashed too so it won't matter. Checkmate. Vlad That's... actually the answer I wanted. mchalakov You are not forced to do anything...your files will not be deleted even when the promo runs out. I'm pretty sure you didn't fill the full 1TB.Also you knew before that the this is a timed promotion. I really don't get the drama around here... Steven Kelby I did fill the full 1tb already, music, pics and video from my phones and cameras. It's good that it won't get deleted, I didn't know that. Đức Thành AFAIK your data won't get deleted when the extra storage expires, but in order to upload new files you'll have to either delete files to free up space or buy new space, which can be quite inconvenient at times. Kevin Brown I do too. Thanks for reminding me. I have unlimited storage through Crash Plan for my home network. I'll download my photos from Drive and upload them to Crash Plan from one of my on-site data servers. I'll write a script to pull down the photos, and let Crash Plan do its thing view every 15 minute back up. Google doesn't stick with ANYTHING, it's like an elementary school Jr Achievement "business." Never count on anything coming from Google to last. mchalakov Why ..a lot of Google services are running and lasting and still last :D Nothing is unlimited. I really doubt that you do need more than 1TB for your photos. For me on the other side - I'm working as a photographer...and I do shoot in RAW. I'm on my 2nd full TB at home :D Besides when the 1TB promo is over next year all the files will still be accessible ,you just can't upload more. Kevin Brown Tell me one service that Google's put out in the past ten years that's still running. Other than search and AdWords.. I will download because Google cannot be trusted to keep those photos. They are not customer focused one whit. I also shoot in RAW with my camera, and I too upload to my home network, which is backed up to Crash Plan. I also have a second backup to a former employer. The Google bit is just phone photos that are spur of the moment. 1639GB used as of today. That includes things like work documents, Titanium Pro backups on top of my photos. Kevin Brown Top 10 of many services Google has killed, and told customers to go eat shit and die. http://lifehacker.com/top-10-services-google-killed-off-1792897076 Andy The expiration made it pretty meaningless to me anyway.

Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Snuck right in since I got level 4 just last month Kevin Davis Damn, almost to level 4, I guess I'd better pick up the pace for the next couple of weeks, as the author mentioned. KingS I'm so glad I reached level last year shortly before they got rid of the 1TB offer. David Hyman Me too! Not that I am anywhere near my 1TB limit, it's nice to have Đức Thành How long does the 1 TB last? Fiorta Just claimed mine two days ago... Just in time it appears Ash The person who works so much to reach level 4, Google should give them atleast 50 GB free for life Samarth I second that! Vratislav Jindra I third that. SimonPieman Works so much by posting shit reviews consisting of "ok" for places they have never been to.. Google would have been better going for quality over quantity. Ash You are right. But not all are like this. I am at level 2 in 4 years and all my reviews are original and detailed plus i upload photos as well. It might take my another 1-2 years to reach level 4 Drakenoid I wrote detailed reviews in a rush last year when 1tb promotion was announced as being removed and got to level 4 and got the promotion but I was downgraded to level 3 for some reason, despite none of my reviews being basic. So it doesn't matter. You can try to do what I did, maybe you'll get this promotion. Ozl I reached level 4 by mostly uploading pictures mchalakov This is a risk of any service using user submitted content. They do review the reviews. kerma frog sound like you did it as well faggot Đức Thành If someone manages to reach level 4 in less than 4 months, they probably deserve better than 50 GB, but I'd still take what I can get. Too bad it won't even be an option. AOSPrevails I made lv4 a year ago, back when the reward was 1TB, it got so popular that Google had to nerf it to 100GB and now this. exadeci It was planned all along, they just want free workers so they attract you with advantages and make you "special" with event in their HQ but at the end of the day you work harder and for cheaper (even taking in account the advantages and events) than minimum wage workers and now that they got an army of Local Guides they don't need to offer you anything more than a "badge" Leonardo Baez I need 120pts to reach level 5, what would I get? Tizio Caio An applause Đức Thành A notification from Google that says "Congratulations on reaching Level 5 as a Local Guide!" JP How can you reach level 4 quickly? I'm at 3. Morten Ulv The quickest is probably to do quick reviews of places you've been or answer questions about places you've been. You only get one point per business if I remember correctly, so answering one question per place is enough if you really want to power through. R Gerald Saul You get one point per business, but you get a point for a review, a point for a picture, a point for updating detailed information, etc. Nicholas Conrad Airports and malls my friend. Vlad I modified the schedule of all McDonald's in my country with McDrives. They all have non-stop schedule, so I just took the list from their website and changed all of it on Google Maps. For some reason, I got dropped back to level 2 or 3 after a day, but I already redeemed my 1 TB. Drakenoid They do that, even I got dropped to level 3 (it may have been 2 but it's been an year and am on level 3 now at least) abc I've heard that being a loser with a lot of free time is very helpful. Jason Farrell Same here, but I've only reviewed stuff for fun over the years, instead of spamming crappy "OK" reviews for every little dinky place I've been to like some people do. I've got 111 of the 200 points needed to level up to lvl4, but since I'm already paying $20/yr for the 100GB there's not much point. Drakenoid Write as many detailed reviews as you can for the places you've been to, and redeem it as soon as you get to level 4. JG You can get up to 5 points per location: 1. If it's not yet on Maps, add it 2. If any information (hours, website, phone etc) is incorrect out missing, submit corrections 3. Answer some super yes/no questions 4. Write a review 5. Submit a photo You get 1 point for each, regardless if you submit multiple photos or answer multiple questions. But more never hurts. Spend a weekend walking around your local downtown, mall, and anywhere else there are a lot of businesses. If nothing else, snap a picture of each. If you know the place, answer questions about it. If you really know it, leave a review. That'll get you at least one, if not 3 points per location. Đức Thành Though these are not things I don't already have a good idea about, they're very nice and detailed tips regardless. Saved for future references, thanks. Nate Somsen I just might plug my blog, I wrote like two weeks ago, with helpful ideas on how to get those points... http://www.natesomsen.com/blog/your-guide-to-google-local-guides/ exadeci >Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. 100 GB for a year costs you $24, trying to get level 4 will consume you more time than it's value. 1TB for 2 years was $240 Marcell Lévai I have 148 points, so I need around 50 to get to level 4. Well, I guess I'll start taking photos everywhere. I am a paying Google Drive customer, but also a student, so not needing to pay for 100 gigs of Drive storage for a year would be nice. :P Ramon Yawn. Like..Why give storage only to take it away. So I fill half of that extra 100 GB. After it expires then what? "You're out of space, please delete. Spare me the stress. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The old promos for Moto X for free 1 yr. storage said anything on the drive would stay there, but you couldn't add anything when the year expired. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ And that "anything" includes email attachments, found out the hard way. Vlad No, that includes not being able to receive emails. It's on their FAQ... Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Not sure if you're trying to confirm or contradict, but since you initiated your statement with a negative I'll assume it's the latter so allow me to offer this anecdotal evidence, when my free storage period ran out I kept receiving notifications telling me to delete contents to be able to receive emails. But if in fact you're trying to confirm you should read PixelXLellence's comment and my reply again. Hint: I referenced to the "anything" on the later part of the sentence. Vlad Oops, sorry. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for the Zorak avatar https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/space-ghost.jpg?w=805 Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Heh, thanks. I tried to find someone more Evil™ than Dick Dastardly and who better than Zorak. And it worked. I'm way more evil now and the politically correct bunch finds me unequivocally detestable. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/Space_Ghost_Coast_to_Coast.png P.S. It's all in the eyes. Morten Ulv If you already pay for it, you save like 20 bucks that year. Oh joy. :P Jesús Cuenca Once i got $20 from google to use on cabify, that was nice :v Impulse_Vigil Dang, I'm at 52 pts, time to get contributing. Đức Thành You can make it. I believe in you. Miku is Best Vocaloid I need to hurry the fuck up, I'm level 3. Đức Thành Same, been contributing since January. How long have you been a Local Guide? Miku is Best Vocaloid Since September, I wasn't very active the last few months. Đức Thành How many points have you got? I had 87 points yesterday, and today I'm at 112. Wanna bet on who will level up first? :D Morten Ulv Oh right. I got level 4 back in november, but wanted to wait to redeeming it. Missed the part about expiration after 30 days. Oh well, not like I really need it anyway, seeing as photos are free and it expires after a year. JPLoureiro I contribute for fun and don't expect much in return except for some geeky stats and badges, though some credit for Google play would be nice as well. Đức Thành Same but this news still makes me upset for some reason. I wasn't even aware of the rewards before this (I was vaguely aware that there were awards for Local Guides but that's it, and I'm not even doing this for the rewards). I wonder what this phenomenon is called. Rok Tur! Another job illuminated by technology the critic LOL Same, I like to give fair reviews etc, and I always read other reviews when I go to places. Google credits or some T-shirts would be nice for every level up Chips N I wasn't aware of the program. I knew I got "points" or gained levels for it, but I thought it was just "pointless" fun, no pun intended. It would always ask me nonstop about places I've driven past or places I go in to for a quick five minutes and then leave (just browsing, etc.) If they gave even a penny for each review (in credit), I'd be a tad more tempted to put some thought into leaving a review, for places I've actually been to, of course. Trent I hit level 5 a while back and just recently passed 5,000 points. I hope and think that the reason for these scale backs is to give people like me more incentive to go for the new tiers when they're announced. Đức Thành Well fuck me, 2017 has been a quite effortful yet unrewarding year so far. Not counting many other things mostly unrelated, I've begun actively contributing to Google Maps for the last three months, and while I've added several places, made edits, posted hundreds of photos (reached over 15.000 views just a few days ago) and written quality reviews and yet this is all I got from Google: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b1f85b49be32e63f852423898894791d3b68700553c85aa1791d8352a68cbe1b.png It's just not a very fair system. And now I have to add "getting 87 more Local Guide points in the next 2 weeks" to the list of things to do, if I want to get a reward. Life just doesn't let you catch a break, as it would seem. Maxr1998 Yeah, I also think that's very unfair.. I'm living in the countryside, so it took ages for to reach lvl 3, now I won't even get storage anymore once I finally reach lvl 4. Oh, btw, 87 to 200 is an additional 113 points.. Đức Thành I feel for you man. My problem is mostly a technical one, as I find the whole process of sharing photos to Google Maps from Google Photos to be quite cumbersome (my Nexus 5 has 2-3 GB to store new photos and I back up and delete local photos every 1-2 days or so, so when I get into the mood of actually contributing to Google Maps every few days, I would have to dive into Photos, find photos of places I took few days prior and download them, then upload to Maps; and while this doesn't sound like that much of a problem it becomes a problem for me as I take a *shit load* of photos everyday). 113 points? Well shit, I guess that means more work for me, then. Shon G. I just uploaded about 20 pictures directly from Photos. Đức Thành The problem is I also want to do a review when I add photos, or at least get credited for it, but the way Maps currently implements it, if you add photos directly from Photos via Maps's suggestions it does neither and your contributions stay anonymous. Which is kinda pointless to me. Drakenoid Maps should show your photos from Google photos backup in the app itself, so try that out. Đức Thành I am well aware, what I am complaining about is Maps's current implementation of it. Đức Thành Dunno if you're interested, but I'm here to report on the progress and this is what I managed in the span of one day (going out has been costly and time-consuming and I'm wondering if this is really worth it): https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6b084860808db2c74a19d67429f11e554a5f1b88fc19f5c0b3d9f9e1c6b308b8.png So um, let's see, 88 points to go? This is getting increasingly harder than I thought. But at the same time if you view this as a game it could be quite a fun challenge. By the way, how many points have you got? I think there are a few things you can do to earn points even if you live in the countryside, like visiting monuments and adding new landmarks and whatnot. Just a suggestion. Maxr1998 Great work! I was at 104 15 minutes ago, but you reminded me to open GMaps and now I'm at 111. I might be able to get to 200 until March 17 if I push myself hard enough, but it still sucks to have to hurry so much. Also, since the promotion is only valid one year, it doesn't help me much since I have 100 GB since March 2018 anyway, because of my HTC phone from last year. Would have loved to be able to continue with a fresh year of 100 GB next year, by then finishing my Local guide lvl, but now I will probably have to pay then (I actually need the 100GB for my photos). Maxr1998 So a little update from my side, I hope that you managed to reach lvl 4, I didn't. I got to around 145, 55 more points just wasn't possible (and I still didn't reach it, currently 152). In the end I didn't even bother anymore, I'll probably just buy a subscription next year when my HTC Promotion ends, as I would have had to do anyway, so no real loss for me tbh.. KingS Yeah i feel ya. I got a photo with over 3 million views and it only counts as 1 point, like a photo with only 20 views. Anyways, Id recommend taking a lot of photos when youre out and about, because Google Maps will suggest you add them and they each doing as a point. Also, andere questions about businesses you've been to and keep your reviews short, but detailed. Đức Thành I already do that, maybe much more than I can possibly be expected of, simply because I like to do things properly and thoroughly, but thanks! I will keep it up. Michael D. Local guides are improving Google Maps for free, something that would otherwise would cost lots of money, and this is how Google is thanking us? I'm already a level 4 guide but seeing that there are no real benefits for all the work I've done and the data I've been submitting, I will stop doing so. I've been doing this just for fun, but in reality I've been helping them acquire costly data. Well, that's about what does it. henleyb I do it just to help others and overall hopefully ensure companies improve their services etc. The extra benefits are nice but feel a little shallow with it being for just the year. Especially since if you use it blindly you're then going to have to move all your data before it expires or start paying. Why not give 20GB for life or something, that would be a nice gesture for Google to acknowledge that while we are helping others we're also helping their company too. Either way, I find Google maps incredibly helpful for a vast range of reasons so I'm happy to contribute to 'pay back' and hopefully make it better for everyone without any rewards. Đức Thành Same, I'm a little disappointed in Google tbh but the reason I will keep contributing regardless is going to be because of the community. I was a nerd (still am) who didn't know the street names inside a 1 km diameter around my own area just a year ago, but thanks to people's contributions to Maps I can go out with much more confidence now and I am getting to know way more streets and new interesting places (even helped me with several jobs in the outskirt of my hometown), so being able to contribute back to the community can be seen as a reward in itself. Still disappointed in Google, though. Oh well. LOL Google has been a bunch of cheap little motherfuсkers lately Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Totally agreed with you, Im level 4, but lately Im losing my inspiration for contributing. Cakefish I'm currently Level 3. It's like an addictive minigame. A clever way of crowdsourcing information. Corey Munns I reached level 4 back in December but still haven't gotten my 100gb. Emily My 100 GB only lasted 4 months anyway. When it prematurely ended, I went round and round with help desk people. In the end Drive people said they couldn't help me because it was a Local Guides thing, and Local Guides people said they couldn't help because it was a Drive thing. x.Ramin What about your data? Does it get deleted too? Đức Thành Carl Sagan Dammit Google, I probably should add this "Drive vs. Local Guides rewards contradiction thing" to the "list of things to resolve when I become the head of Google one day," if that issue still hasn't been resolved by then. (Typing this with a straight face because I'm completely and totally serious.) Light I was working on it. Reviewing everywhere I went and all. Well then, I'll just stop and continue on Tripadvisor. No reward, no help building the platform. At least Tripadvisor is mainstream, so I contribute to something people actually use for reviews at least. Đức Thành TripAdvisor is even worse when it comes to the process of making contributions though. Really inconvenient and effortful, and not as many people get to reap the benefits from your reviews either. Chronos90 Do I have to do something to get this reward? I was close to Level 4 and added another review which took me to Level. Didn't got any notice yet LOL I'm almost level 6 bitchеs Margaritas Ante Porcos People are as greedy as orthodox priests. All good deeds need to be paid, otherwise no reviews. eep2378 Good thing I'm level 4 already...😀 Ailín Ó’S I still have the 1TB of free storage but I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand it will help limit people reviewing places they've never been to with a "cool" or "good" or whatever just to get the points but on the other it no longer incentivises people to genuinely contribute to the app and make it better. belac77 I wonder if they'll replace it with another perk? mchalakov Whoa...chill everybody. Even though we as Local Guides are helping Google ,we are also helping each other. Especially in some areas which you don't have any information. The moment you started doing this you knew there is going to be nothing in return or if there is anything it's a limited promotion. So if you want 100GB buy it it's $2 /month. kerma frog how bout no? Maleko Wow... I did a lot to get to Level 4 to redeem that free storage, and I did it with decent photos and decent reviews etc... Firstly it's pointless to have the storage expire, especially when Google don't offer 500GB in their storage tariff. Now to remove the incentive totally... dick move. GarethSargeant 100 reviews since yesterday. Sticking with places I've been to though. My name is…. And thats why they dont offer GB any more. Nate Somsen You'd think that Google would have some kind of algorithm to detect an unnatural increase in contributions in such a short amount of time... Đức Thành Why though? Regardless of the frequency of new photos and reviews, it's the accuracy and quality that matters, right? Some people like to take lots of photos of places but don't contribute right away every time, and when they do it in their spare time just have to batch-process a bunch of new places, I think it should be fair game. Ohid Khan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6d2b4544c67bb885685a2487b72f82a4d31c0735e832702b911d6210b1a3a29c.jpg Wendy’s Angels Does she come from a pedophile family? She's another like chelsea handler, with her old slutty self, creaming over Obama. Doby Gillis Your dementia is kicking in. WTF does that have to do with the article? Dirge No worries, I got the 1TB free for 2 years back in July. TheScienceEnthusiast1130 LMFAO Google = $$$ SB Level 5 - 167 photos - over a million views. Geoff Johnson Glad I got in when it was 1TB, which is good through March 2018. Андрей Бельский And what if i have been of 4th level (long ago) and will reach 5th level. will I get this 100gb storage as promotion? Biggles Remember when the Google motto was "don't be evil"? We've done a pile of work for Google for free. It'd cost them a lot of money to either buy the data if they could buy it somewhere, or cost them a lot of money to hire people to do data entry. Either way, it saved them forking out. And it improved their search and maps tremendously, so that it strengthened their grip of the market and they make yet more money. The cost to them was drive space, and probably so little in financial terms that they'd struggle to actual calculate it. People are upset less because of the cost of Drive storage, less because the perks changed, but more because Google made out they cared about their users and having a community of local guides. And it turns out that they don't care. Anthony I'm happy I hit level 4 back when it was 1tb. I didnt know it went down. Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/18c73e40001f06e7055d333e9d4ad4b7ac0a0c1db1e2b065f1971cce06ae3d02.png Omega192 ITT a bunch of entitled whiners. Oh, you've "done a pile of work for Google for free"? They've been providing many if not most of their services to you for free, Maps included. If you really cba to contribute to Maps unless you're given something in return, then go right ahead and stop contributing. No one is forcing you to continue. Wouldn't be surprised if this was brought on by people leaving low effort reviews just to get to the point they were rewarded. God forbid Google take steps to lessen that rather than just shell out unlimited rewards at a loss. chimichanga I've reached level 4 a few days ago but still haven't seen an increase in Google Drive space. How long does this usually take? Was thinking it would be more or less imminent. chimichanga all good, have actually received it now Vladislav Shumkin so the bonus drive space just arrives later automatically? or you need to apply somewhere to redeem? chimichanga yes, an email to activate the free storage arrived around 3 days after I reached level 4 Anthony C Russano III I was lucky enough to secure the FREE 1TB before they pulled it. I am so stoked on that one. hehehe Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 11 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

If you own a Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S6, or Galaxy Note 5, you should start preparing for your Android Nougat update. Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat update has been out since August. The operating system introduces new features and fixes and it’s slowly making its way to popular smartphones and tablets. The list now includes Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Samsung’s Android Nougat beta is over and the company pushing out its official version of Android Nougat. The company’s Android Nougat roll out is currently limited but it will gain steam in the first half of the year with more roll outs planned for the Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, and a handful of other devices. The company started with the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy Note 5 Android Nougat updates but the update has since moved onto some of Samsung’s newer tablets. It’s expected to hit more devices in the first half of the year. These Nougat updates are based on Android 7.0 (Samsung might be planning Android 7.1 upgrades) and they deliver a long list of changes to Samsung’s flagships. With the Android 7.0 Nougat release underway and expected to hit more devices in the not-so-distant future, Galaxy smartphone and tablet users should be keeping tabs on Nougat. You should also be taking some steps to prepare your device for the upgrade. Android Nougat is a huge update, an important one, but it could cause problems for many of you. This is why it’s important to do some prep work ahead of your installation. It’s impossible to predict what kind of problems you might run into. While most of you will end up installing Android 7.0 Nougat on your Galaxy device, there are some things we think you need to do before installing it on your Galaxy S7, Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, or any other Galaxy phone or tablet. Get Familiar with Android 7.0 Nougat   1 / 9 There are a several steps to take before the Android Nougat update arrives for your device. One of the first steps is to get familiar with Android Nougat and more specifically, Samsung's version of Android Nougat. It's different than Google's.  Samsung's version of Nougat incorporates some of the features Google introduced to its Nexus line of devices last year. We recommend getting familiar with the base version of Android Nougat. To do that, take a look at our Android Marshmallow vs. Android Nougat walkthrough. The walkthrough will take you through the key differences between Nougat and Marshmallow and that will help you get familiar with the changes coming aboard your Nougat update. The more comfortable you are ahead of your release the better.  You'll also want to get familiar with Samsung's version of Nougat as it comes with some major tweaks to the user interface, some new modes, and a whole lot more.  To help you do that, take a look at Samsung's updated consumer guide for the Galaxy S7 and the guide for Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Students and their families are backed into a corner. As students across the United States are handed school-issued laptops and signed up for educational cloud services, the way the educational system treats the privacy of students is undergoing profound changes—often without their parents’ notice or consent, and usually without a real choice to opt out of privacy-invading technology. Students are using technology in the classroom at an unprecedented rate. One-third of all K-12 students in U.S. schools use school-issued devices.1 Google Chromebooks account for about half of those machines.2 Across the U.S., more than 30 million students, teachers, and administrators use Google’s G Suite for Education (formerly known as Google Apps for Education), and that number is rapidly growing.3 Student laptops and educational services are often available for a steeply reduced price, and are sometimes even free. However, they come with real costs and unresolved ethical questions.4 Throughout EFF’s investigation over the past two years, we have found that educational technology services often collect far more information on kids than is necessary and store this information indefinitely. This privacy-implicating information goes beyond personally identifying information (PII) like name and date of birth, and can include browsing history, search terms, location data, contact lists, and behavioral information. Some programs upload this student data to the cloud automatically and by default. All of this often happens without the awareness or consent of students and their families. In short, technology providers are spying on students—and school districts, which often provide inadequate privacy policies or no privacy policy at all, are unwittingly helping them do it. Since 2015, EFF has been taking a closer look at whether and how educational technology (or “ed tech”) companies are protecting students’ privacy and their data. This paper presents what we have observed and learned about student privacy in the course of our investigation. We aim to more precisely define the problems and issues around student privacy as they affect real students and their families, and to give stakeholders—including parents, students, administrators, and teachers—concrete steps they can take to advocate for student privacy in their own communities. After an introduction to EFF’s approach to student privacy, we turn to our analysis. In Part 1, we report on the results of a large-scale survey and interview study we conducted throughout 2016. In particular, we found that in an alarming number of cases, ed tech suffered from: Lack of transparency. Schools issued devices to students without their parents’ knowledge and consent. Parents were kept in the dark about what apps their kids were required to use and what data was being collected. Investigative burdens. With no notice or help from schools, the investigative burden fell on parents and even students to understand the privacy implications of the technology they were using. Data concerns. Parents had extensive concerns about student data collection, retention, and sharing. We investigated the 152 ed tech services that survey respondents reported were in use in classrooms in their community, and found that their privacy policies were lacking in encryption, data retention, and data sharing policies. Lack of choice. Parents who sought to opt their children out of device or software use faced many hurdles, particularly those without the resources to provide their own alternatives. Overreliance on “privacy by policy.” School staff generally relied on the privacy policies of ed tech companies to ensure student data protection. Parents and students, on the other hand, wanted concrete evidence that student data was protected in practice as well as in policy. Need for digital privacy training and education. Both students and teachers voiced a desire for better training in privacy-conscious technology use. The data we collected on the experiences, perceptions, and concerns of stakeholders across the country highlights the need for ed tech companies to take seriously the privacy concerns of students, parents, teachers, and administrators. In Part 2, we provide in-depth analysis of ed tech’s legal and policy framework in the U.S. State and federal laws that are supposed to protect student privacy have not kept up with ed tech’s rapid growth. We address: Industry self-regulation. The Student Privacy Pledge, enforced by the FTC and voluntarily signed by ed tech companies, features glaring loopholes in its definitions of what constitutes "student information" and "educational service providers." Federal law. We provide legal analysis of key federal laws the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), highlighting major flaws in each law—namely, FERPA’s “school official” loophole and questions about parental consent in COPPA. State law. As states bring forward more and more student privacy legislation, three have stood out: California, Colorado, and Connecticut. We describe each state’s current legislation and the ways in which they each take unique steps to protect student data, provide resources to school districts, and rein in ed tech companies. In Part 3, we turn our analysis into a call for action and present our recommendations for: school administrators, teachers, librarians, system administrators, parents, students, and ed tech companies themselves. Finally, we conclude by bringing our survey reporting, legal analysis, and recommendations together to briefly state the key problems and issues surrounding K-12 digital student privacy in the U.S. Want to learn more about digital privacy?

Introduction In December 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation started a campaign to raise awareness about the risks to student privacy when companies collect students’ data. Since then, we have fought for the privacy and security of student data on multiple fronts. We launched a nationwide survey to learn how parents, students, teachers, and administrators experienced student privacy issues; we provided answers to questions about the legal and technological landscape of ed tech; we filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission regarding the data collection practices of Google’s G Suite for Education; and we created a wealth of resources for parents, students, and school staff. While numerous and complex dynamics shape the ed tech and student privacy landscape, we have focused on only one: the threat to K-12 students and their privacy posed by school-issued devices and ed tech platforms. Our narrow focus interacts with broader driving forces in ed tech. While we cannot address them all, they provide valuable context and deserve acknowledgement. For example, ed tech gives disabled students new learning opportunities and is indispensable in special learning environments. Further, technology in schools gives states opportunities to understand student performance over time and be accountable for the effects of educational initiatives. Ed tech’s growth is also closely tied to newer market and policy forces. Valued at over $8 billion,7 the educational technology sector in the U.S. has been described as “the world’s most data-mineable industry by far.”8 As companies race to produce and capture more student data, the U.S. Department of Education has encouraged schools to use “big data” analysis to improve assessment and educational innovation.9 Common Core’s computerized testing requirements and other developments in education policy have also increasingly driven ed tech adoption forward.10 In the midst of these changing requirements, underfunded schools’ lack of resources can make them particularly susceptible to offers of free devices and educational software from large ed tech companies.11 While governments, schools, and industry shape the ed tech space, sensitive student data is caught in the middle—and this is where EFF places its focus. As ed tech growth outpaces legal and ethical understanding of its privacy implications, we risk placing students under silent yet pervasive surveillance that chills their creative expression both in and outside the classroom, and tracks their online behavior before they are old enough to understand its consequences. In the long term, protecting student privacy means protecting children from surveillance culture at school and at home. The constant surveillance in which ed tech results can warp children’s privacy expectations, lead them to self-censor, and limit their creativity.12 A surveillance environment built by trusted teachers and educators will socialize children to ignore and even accept the routine collection, retention, and sale of their personal information.13 Ed tech unchecked threatens to normalize the next generation to a digital world in which users hand over data without question in return for free services—a world that is less private not just by default, but by design. In this white paper, we aim to paint a vivid picture of what it looks like when the privacy policies and practices of ed tech companies interact with real students and their families. We hope to provide a more holistic understanding of not only the legal and policy framework in which ed tech is growing, but also the real-life privacy impact that educational technologies have on the individuals tasked with deploying, using, and understanding them. Part 1: Survey Results Student privacy is about more than data collection and legal protections; it is about real students and their families. What does it look like in real communities when ed tech company policies and state and federal legislation interact with students and their data? In late 2015, we launched an online survey to collect information and stories from real people about their experiences with student privacy. Over the next year, we heard from over 1000 students, parents, students, teachers, administrators, and other stakeholders about the student privacy experiences and challenges they had encountered in their own communities. Eight main trends emerged from survey responses and interviews. We found that (1) parents and students experienced a lack of transparency from schools, with parents reporting little or no disclosure of what technology their students were using in the classroom. (2) This lack of notice from schools put the investigative burden on parents and even students to address (3) their extensive concerns about student data collection, retention, and sharing. And their concerns were well-founded; (4) we investigated the 152 ed tech services reported as in use in classrooms, and found troubling trends in their privacy policies regarding lack of encryption, opaque data retention practices, and inadequate data aggregation and de-identification. (5) Parents who chose to withdraw their students from certain technology use were often met with few choices and insurmountable hurdles. (6) Stakeholders’ lack of trust in policies and legislation highlighted the fact that “privacy by policy” is not good enough, and must be backed up by concrete technological safeguards. To successfully execute any privacy-protecting policies and safeguards, (7) teachers need better training in technology and digital privacy. Finally, (8) students need enhanced digital literacy education to take control of their privacy in the classroom. Below we describe our methods and the characteristics of our respondents and their schools before delving into these eight findings in more detail. Methods We distributed an online survey on student privacy via EFF’s website, blog posts, the EFFector newsletter, and social media between December 2015 and January 2017. From there, the survey “snowballed” out, with respondents encouraged to share the survey link with others. The survey asked about respondents’ location; what kind of devices their district was issuing, if any; whether devices were issued on a one-to-one basis; whether devices stayed at school or could go home with students; what grade levels were issued devices; what ed tech programs, apps, or software the school was using, if any; how parents were notified about data collection, if at all; whether parents could opt their children out of technology use; and respondents’ self-reported level of concern about student privacy. Finally, the survey concluded with an open-ended question requesting any additional information respondents wanted to share, from which we collected the quotes that appear throughout the findings below. (See full survey in Appendix.) After the survey concluded, we selected several respondents for longer, in-depth interviews. We drew from the approximately one-third of survey respondents who provided their contact information and indicated that they were willing to be contacted by EFF. These interviews appear throughout our findings below as pull-out case studies, each digging into one individual’s experience with a particular aspect of student privacy. Because we used a “snowball” sample and targeted interviews, our findings cannot be considered generalizable or representative. Instead, the survey results and case studies are meant to shed light on the human side of student privacy: the attitudes, perceptions, and types of individual concern and awareness that shape action around student privacy on the ground. Respondents and Overall Trends We heard from 1034 survey respondents from several stakeholder groups: 468 students 393 parents 69 teachers, including librarians and other teaching staff 31 school administrators, including system administrators and other general staff 73 other community members Students and parents make up the majority of our respondents at about 83 percent. Therefore, while we report on stakeholders across the spectrum, the survey puts us in a position to make the strongest assertions about students and parents. Respondents came from 45 states, Washington D.C., and Guam, as well as from 17 other countries around the world. While this paper focuses on U.S. policy and practices, the geographical variety of survey responses serves as a reminder that ed tech companies—along with the services they offer and the privacy issues they pose—are global. Google devices and platforms dominated survey responses. Half of respondents reported Chromebook use in their school or district, followed by iPads (32%) and Microsoft Surface tablets (3%). G Suite for Education was also the most popular platform, with 63 percent of respondents reporting G Suite use in their district. Note that these numbers do not necessarily reflect the school adoption of these ed tech products and services nationally. They simply mean that we heard the most about Google, and therefore are in a position to report the most stakeholder experiences with its products. Among respondents, 45 percent reported that their schools or districts did not provide parents with written disclosure about ed tech and data collection, and 31 percent were not sure if such disclosure was provided. Further, 32 percent of all respondents reported that their schools or districts did not offer opt-out—that is, non-technological classroom alternatives for families who did not want students using certain technology—and 37 percent were not sure if opt-out was available. Again, these numbers do not describe school policy patterns across the country. Instead, these numbers characterize the environments of our respondents, who overwhelmingly experienced a lack of transparency and lack of choice with regard to student privacy. Findings We organize our findings into eight key takeaways, supported by quotes and statistics from the survey and in-depth case studies from subsequent interviews. 1. Lack of Transparency The notice and disclosure process is broken. Parents who responded to the survey were overwhelmingly not notified when schools started using new softwares and devices, created email accounts for students, or posted pictures of students on school or teacher social media pages. One parent in a Maryland public school wrote: We were given no information about our first-grader receiving a device—a tablet—this year. And when we ask questions, there is little information given at every level. Even students took note of this, with one student observing that their Google account was “provided suddenly without any notice.” Teachers also had accounts created for them without notice or consent. One teacher wrote: Staff and student details—that is, full names and school email addresses—were passed to Google to create individual logins without consent from staff. I’m not sure about consent from parents. Sometimes, parents did not receive any information about ed tech use until after the technology had already been implemented and was in active classroom use. A parent in a California public school described how and when they were notified: The specifics of the technology our children would use were not provided until back-to-school night, where the teacher emphasized the Chromebooks’ value for individualized instruction. These respondents are not alone. Survey trends regarding written disclosure of school practices and policies show that a majority of parents found themselves in the dark. Twenty-three percent of parents did not know whether or not they had received written disclosure about their school’s ed tech practices, and 57 percent were sure they had not. That adds up to 80 percent of surveyed parents who did not have clear, readily accessible disclosure, suggesting a breakdown of communication between schools and parents. 2. The Investigative Burden As a result of these failures in communication, the burden of investigating ed tech and its effect on privacy fell on parents and even students. With awareness of technology in the classroom but without details, parents launched often exhaustive investigations of how their children were using ed tech. A North Carolina charter school parent described a months-long effort to obtain a comprehensive list of the software, programs, and apps her child was using in school: I have never received any written policy about how many apps the school uses and how they collect student data. The district maintains a website for parents to obtain information regarding technology in the classroom, but I have not found anything there about student privacy. When we asked for the apps that the school was using, we were hoping to see in writing what they’re using. Instead, we got a short, verbal list—but when we look at our son’s iPad, we see a lot more programs than what they told us about. What we want is a comprehensive snapshot of what technology experiences our son is having, especially if he has to log in to use them. Many parents’ efforts were stymied before they could get that far. Parents described confusing procedures around student privacy in their schools and districts. Multiple parents said there was “no information available” about data collection or student privacy, with a Connecticut parent adding: The school was vague about what info was collected. It isn’t clear who to speak with about the program and concerns. In some cases, students took the investigation into their own hands. A student in a California private school described their efforts to find out what was installed on school-issued iPads: I’m privacy-conscious, and I only know what I know due to reading through agreements and manually inspecting the install certificates on our iPads. Another student in California, this one at a public school, went online to find privacy policies: The companies providing the online services list privacy policies on their websites, but these policies are not shared directly with us or our parents. The impetus should be on schools and ed tech companies themselves, not the parents and students on whom the technology is imposed, to be transparent about what technologies are being used in the classroom, what privacy policies govern them, and what privacy implications they may carry. As it stands, parents were on their own to find the information they needed to protect their children and advocate for their privacy. Case Study: A California Parent Caught Off-Guard by Chromebooks Katherine W. was seven years old, in the third grade, when her teacher first issued Google Chromebooks to the class. Katherine’s father, Jeff, was concerned. Jeff feared that Chromebooks and G Suite for Education use might come at the cost of his daughter’s privacy. He negotiated with his daughter’s teacher so she could use a different computer and not have to use a Google account. But as third grade came to a close, the district made clear that there would be no exception made the next year. Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the data that students often use to log into Google services—like name, student number, and birthday—can’t be shared with third parties—including Google—without written parental consent. But the district never sought written consent from Jeff or his wife. The district provided no details about the types of devices students would be required to use or the data that would be collected on students. Rather than allowing Jeff to sign his daughter up for the Chromebook program, the district consented on his behalf, making the device mandatory for Katherine—with no ability to opt out. This means that Katherine is required by the school to use Google with a personalized Google account, and Google can create a profile of her—that is, a dossier of information that vendors collect on users for advertising, market research, or other purposes—and use it for commercial purposes the moment she clicks away from G Suite for Education. Jeff went through several emails and a tense meeting before the district agreed to provide Katherine with a non-Google option for fourth grade—but once again declared that such an accommodation would not be possible for fifth grade. That’s when EFF reached out to the district. Our legal team drafted a letter to the district to outline the privacy concerns associated with school-issued Chromebooks. The letter urged the district to permit “all students—if their parents so decide—to use alternative devices, software, and websites, for the upcoming school year and every year.” For Jeff, the biggest concern isn’t just the data Google collects on students. It’s the long-term ramifications for children who are taught to hand over data to Google without question. As Jeff explained it, “In the end, Google is an advertising company. They sell ads, they track information on folks. And we’re not comfortable with our daughter getting forced into that at such an early age, when she doesn’t know any better.” 3. Parent Concerns About Data Collection and Use When parents’ questions went unanswered, they were left with serious data concerns, particularly when devices and ed tech programs came home with students. Parents who responded to the survey were particularly concerned about personally identifiable information (PII) that could be used to identify a specific student, such as first/last name, birth date, student ID, graduation date, address, etc. One Utah public school parent summed up a range of concerns: Schools should not require students to use tools that involuntarily, or without express parental permission, collect data on students. This includes internal processing of data in order to “improve products,” understanding user behavior to promote advertising, and sharing data with third parties. A parent from a Maryland public school had suspicions about data collection, retention, and eventual use by ed tech companies: They are collecting and storing data to be used against my child in the future, creating a profile before he can intellectually understand the consequences of his searches and digital behavior. Parents were also conscious of the possibility that their children’s data would be shared, sold, or otherwise commodified in the “untapped industry of selling students’ information for advertising and profiling.” The details were generally unclear, as school privacy policies said “not a word about how our kids’ learning is essentially becoming Google’s data.” One Maryland parent wrote: The school system does not even acknowledge that our child’s data is being collected and possibly sold. Within schools themselves, respondents observed practices that threatened to reveal students’ PII on a smaller scale. Poor login and password management practices using PII were of particular concern. One California public school used students’ birthdates as passwords. According to another parent: The passwords are defaulted to student ID. Students are not allowed to change these passwords, and they have received emails stating that students are to stop attempting to change passwords. The student ID numbers are printed, unredacted, on schedules handed out to students and, per my child, “follow a pattern that is easily guessed.” When students came home with their school-issued devices and online homework, parents’ data concerns extended from students’ data to the family’s home networks and devices. In addition to imposing surveillance on students at home as well as in the classroom,14 ed tech had the potential to make other members of the household feel vulnerable. One public school parent in Pennsylvania wrote about their student accessing ed tech services on a personal device: I have no idea how to find out the extent of information they [ed tech providers] have access to on our personal computers. Another parent in a Virginia public school was concerned about their student using a school-issued device at home: The students are required to use the laptops at home for assignments, but that could expose our home networks to the school system. Parents’ concerns above highlight the extent to which student privacy violations may go beyond the classroom. Student data—or, more broadly, data collected on students in the course of educational activities at school, at home, and elsewhere—may interact with advertising, drive inferences and profiles about individual students, or be shared with third parties. 4. Ed Tech Services Lacking Standard Privacy Precautions All stakeholders—students, parents, teachers, administrators, and other staff alike—faced an overwhelming number and range of ed tech apps, softwares, programs, and services. Survey respondents reported 152 distinct apps, software, and services in use in their schools’ or districts’ classrooms (see full list in Appendix). We investigated every service’s privacy policy—particularly practices in data retention, encryption, and de-identification and aggregation—and they exhibited concerning trends.15 Privacy policies Of the 152 ed tech services reported to us, only 118 had published privacy policies online. Some applications note that schools may implement their own privacy policies to govern personal data submitted to the services by student users. Data retention Of the 118 privacy policies, 78 mention data retention practices. Few privacy policies address deletion of data after periods of inactivity, which would allow the applications to retain information even after students graduate. We found a range of specific practices here, including: Evernote maintains copies of information on the service’s back-up server for up to a year after a user has requested that the data be deleted. For Haiku Learning, the schools, rather than individual students, retain the authority and ability to delete information from the application. Lexia Learning requires that students and parents contact the school administrator to facilitate requests to access, change, or delete personal information. Absent a request from a school administrator, Lexia retains the information for as long as the account is active or as needed for Lexia to provide services. Storyboard retains student data for up to four years of inactivity. Encryption Of the 118 privacy policies we examined, only 46 state that the vendor uses encryption. That means that only about 30 percent of the 152 services reported to us make any statement about encryption. This lines up with previous reports on the lack of support for encryption in ed tech.16 Encryption is crucial to protect sensitive student information from eavesdropping, and encrypting data in transit is widely recognized as absolutely necessary for even a minimal level of security. However, among the policies we investigated, encryption was most often only mentioned in connection with protecting the billing information of clients. Generally, policies gave little information about encryption protocols or which data a given service encrypts. De-identification and aggregation Of the 118 privacy policies, only 51 mention de-identification or aggregation of user data. Data de-identification is almost exclusively mentioned in connection with providing information to third parties about their services, reporting on student performance in districts, or analyzing use of their services. 5. Barriers to Opt-Out Parents who acted on their concerns to opt their children out of technology were met with multiple hurdles. 40 percent of parents who responded to the survey did not know whether or not they could opt out of technology use in their school or district, and about 30 percent were sure they could not. That adds up to a whopping 70 percent of surveyed parents who did not perceive options or alternatives for their children’s education. Even in schools with opt-out policies on the books, families struggled to opt their children out of technology use. One parent from an Arizona private school wrote, simply: Opt-out is possible in theory, but not in practice. An Oregon public school student who investigated opt-out options on their own found a disconnect between the school’s apparent willingness to accommodate and what options the school was actually prepared to provide in practice: I personally spoke with the teachers at my school about technical judgments and hesitations I had. They were fully willing to allow me to use alternative means of technology. However, no alternatives were set up. Finally, a teacher at a California private school wrote about their school’s lack of preparedness: No parents have inquired about opt-out yet, but we do not have a plan in place for if and when this does happen. The difficulty of putting opt-out into practice can come from the additional burden it puts on administrators and teachers who have adopted increasingly digital pedagogical systems. As technology becomes more and more baked into lesson plans and day-to-day teaching, it can be difficult for students or teachers to function without using school-issued devices or ed tech programs. At a school issuing Chromebooks, one Iowa public school parent observed: Most homework must be done with these laptops. I don’t know how opting out would even work. Even if we used alternatives, the formats required for teachers to read assignments would make it difficult for students to submit on paper. My child’s teachers all use digital submission and feedback systems, which means her data would end up there eventually even if we did opt out. This dynamic contributed to some families’ decisions not to take advantage of opt-out options even when they were available. When technology is a critical part of learning, insufficient opt-out options can mean students end up with a lower-quality or even discriminatory classroom experience. For example, one parent described refusing to let their child complete homework online, and their child receiving lower grades as a result. Worse, some parents found that their students’ participation in classroom technology continued even after they thought that had effectively opted out. A public school parent in Pennsylvania wrote: Teachers keep creating accounts for my child on cloud apps even though I’ve asked the principal and teachers not to do this. They sometimes have my child use teachers’ accounts. Even when they functioned as written, opt-out policies may not have left room for parents to make specific allowances for some ed tech activities and opt out of others. Instead, this public school parent in Arizona was met with an “all-or-nothing” policy regarding Internet use in general: The agreements are legacy agreements that were issued to get permission from parents to allow students to use wifi. They never updated the agreement, and now use it as blanket permission for anything that occurs online. A lack of workable opt-out alternatives restricts choices for everyone, but in particular discriminates against the students who are most vulnerable to begin with: those with fewer resources who can’t afford to provide their own device alternatives. For such families, the common opt-out alternative of using a personal device rather than a school-issued device is impossible. Parents as well as students felt this lack of choices. One student wrote: I’m not a fan of data collection, but I can’t afford my own computer, so I’ve had to compromise the past several years. Giving parents and students the option to opt out of classroom technology use is a necessary—but not sufficient—component of protecting student privacy. In an ideal world, schools and ed tech providers would provide students with technology so beneficial and privacy-friendly that they and their parents would not even want to opt out. In reality, however, digital privacy is not a one-size-fits-all proposition, and families will always have a range of legitimate reasons for opting out of or tailoring their student’s use of technology. Case Study: An Indiana Administrator Works to Provide Opt-Out In a rural, partly Amish district in Indiana, schools are rapidly adopting ed tech. Eric M. is the Director of Technology for the district’s 2100 students. In addition to G Suite for Education, students use software from major publishers like McGraw Hill and Pearson as well as software from smaller vendors like Mobymax, Achieve3000, and Nearpod. “It seems like every classroom you look into is using technology,” Eric said. “As a technology director, that makes me both excited and scared.” Eric and his colleagues have taken several steps to protect students and support teachers—chief among them providing a strong opt-out system. Eric’s district has been working on providing opt-out alternatives since before students had Chromebooks in the classroom. Eric’s district serves a large Amish community, and Amish students generally decline the use of technology. In order to respect the religious and cultural views of students, the schools are well-practiced in providing hard-copy options and alternative assignments. The district is also prepared should students abuse technology with behavior such as bullying. “Opting out is not the only reason for a student to not have a device in their hands,” Eric said. The schools provide students and their parents with a “menu” of options for opting out. In addition to FERPA-compliant options for whether or not students’ names and pictures can appear in the school directory, yearbook, website, etc., families can separately choose whether or not they want their student to use technology in the classroom. This is a strong contrast to the “all or nothing” opt-out structure some schools employ, in which students who opt out of classroom technology are also automatically taken out of the yearbook. “It’s easy to do an ‘all or nothing,’ but I don’t think it’s the right thing to do,” Eric said. “I wish I could take it even further than that—the ideal scenario would be to break down the use of technology a little bit more.” For example, a parent might be fine with their student using all technology except for cloud services that require an account, or a parent might want their student to have access to the Internet at school but only on a family-owned device rather than a school-issued Chromebook. Families may change their opt-out status each year. “We don’t assume year after year that the same student is in the same boat,” Eric said. “We find in practice that most parents aren’t opting out their students, but there are a few and they have very legitimate reasons for doing so.” 6. The Shortcomings of "Privacy by Policy" Survey respondents described varying levels of trust in ed tech companies as well as schools and districts themselves. School staff generally had the most trust in “privacy by policy”—that is, the ability of policies, audits, and procedures to ensure student privacy. A teacher in a New York private school using Chromebooks described, for example, “an implicit trust in Google and its practices.” A public school administrator in Indiana, however, was uncertain: Although the service providers (Google, Microsoft, major publishers, etc.) say they are respecting student privacy, I am uncertain what is really happening in the cloud. Parents, on the other hand, consistently were not satisfied to take the schools’, ed tech companies’, or states’ word, and preferred to independently verify all policy claims. One public school parent in Wisconsin wrote: The school references a special agreement between the Department of Public Instruction and our state’s schools to protect student data. But I don’t know what this agreement means for my child. Is data destroyed after my student leaves the district? Does Google own this data? Can they build a profile on my student? Can data be collected when teachers’ correspondence or other documents discuss my child? These are all questions that should be answered. I don’t feel like I should have to take the word of the school on this. One North Carolina parent expressed a lack of confidence in state and federal law: I have no confidence that any of my child’s current or future school information will be protected by legislation. Students showed the least trust in schools, ed tech vendors, and their policies. This lack of trust translated into increased caution and even chilling effects when students used school-issued devices and ed tech programs. One student wrote: Because of the grey area surrounding my district’s policies and general distrust of the district to uphold my privacy concerns, I am very careful about how I use my Chromebook. For many parents and students, privacy policies and even legislation were simply not enough. They wanted to know what was actually happening to students’ data in practice, not just what was promised by policies. Case Study: A System Administrator Advocates for Student Privacy Safeguards When Matt L. started to raise the alarm about educational technology in his school district, he knew it would ruffle some feathers. As a system administrator (or sysadmin), Matt is at the center of deploying, configuring, and maintaining Google devices and software for his rural, public district’s 10,000 students. “I don’t want to say that Google or Chromebooks or any of this stuff is inherently bad,” Matt said. “Getting these tools into the hands of kids is hard to argue with. That’s why I got into technology.” As the district has continued to expand its technology use, however, Matt has started to have concerns about consolidating students’ educational and personal information in one company. “We’re putting all our eggs in one basket that we’re not in control of,” he said. “We don’t know where this student data is going.” After requests to talk about student privacy issues, Matt’s boss pointed him to the district’s as well as Google’s privacy policies. But this did not lessen Matt’s concerns. “We have privacy policies for our website, and for our student academic records, but not so much for students’ information in regards to what Google is collecting,” he said. “We can’t guarantee what Google is or is not doing with this information. It’s all pretty vague, and it’s not the kind of thing you want to be vague about.” Unsatisfied by “privacy by policy,” Matt is investigating how he can implement “privacy by practice” —that is, prioritizing student privacy with active safeguards to augment and ensure existing policy, like technical settings and opt-out options. His first step has been to “crank down the lid” on privacy settings so that students use Google products as anonymously as possible by default, without associating their online profiles with identifying information. Ideally, technical controls like these will make privacy the default in students’ and teachers’ work. Matt’s conversations with colleagues have moved forward in fits and starts, and are constantly changing as the district’s technology situation changes. For example, a system-wide update gave Matt an opportunity to propose concurrent changes in ed tech implementation. But, soon after, discussions about abandoning local storage and migrating to Google Drive ran counter to Matt’s efforts to locally control students’ data. Matt remains persistent and committed to advocating for more secure, more private student systems. “It’s a really hard problem, but we need to come up with an answer,” Matt said. 7. Inadequate Technology and Privacy Training for Teachers Survey responses showed that multiple stakeholders did not think existing technology and privacy training for teachers was keeping up with the increasing role of technology in the classroom. Closing the skills gap for teachers is crucial because well-trained, informed staff are necessary to move beyond “privacy by policy” and implement verifiable, accountable “privacy by practice.” One of the biggest problems with “privacy by policy” is that it relies on all staff members being up-to-date on complex, sometimes vague policies, and having the time and resources to comply with them consistently. Even the best policies and legislation are rendered toothless if staff members, administrators, and teachers are not equipped to implement them correctly.17 Parents overwhelmingly saw teachers and other school staff as unaware and non-expert in technology. Survey responses used various images here: parents described ed tech as “the wild west” or “a ticking time bomb,” and saw school staff “jumping on the ed tech train,” working “by the seat of their pants,” and “winging it.” Teachers themselves felt unequipped to handle tech in the classroom, with one describing many ed tech programs as “too complicated for most teachers to use.” Teachers also voiced concerns about inadequate training on digital security and privacy. A public school teacher in New Mexico wrote: No training in media literacy has been provided to teachers or students, though teachers had to watch a lame computer-generated PowerPoint to earn a certification saying we understood the ramifications of exposing school systems to outside threats or so-called “bad guys.” Another public school teacher, this one in Florida, described the lack of training and knowledge as a district-wide issue: The county does not seem to be deliberately ignoring privacy concerns, but just lacks general knowledge about ongoing discussions about student privacy. At the same time, teachers felt that they carried the “burden and blame” when privacy violations occurred in the classroom. Many observed a tension between a need for more thorough training and a lack of the funding, resources, and staffing to make that training readily available. The teachers who responded to the survey were acutely aware that, even without adequate training, they were still regarded as the first line of defense in protecting student privacy. Case Study: An Illinois Librarian on Better Teacher Training As a school librarian at a small K-12 district in Illinois, Angela K. is uniquely positioned to advocate for student privacy. Trained as educators, privacy specialists, and technologists, school librarians like Angela bring not only the skills but also a professional mandate to lead their communities in privacy and intellectual freedom. In search of a balance between technology use and privacy protection, Angela is asking hard, fundamental questions about ed tech. “We can use technology to do this, but should we? Is it giving us the same results as something non-technological?” Angela asked. “We need to see the big picture. How do we take advantage of these tools while keeping information private and being aware of what we might be giving away?” Angela wants to see more direct education around privacy concepts and expectations, and not just for students. Teachers and other staff in her district would benefit as well. “As a librarian, I believe in the great things technology can offer,” she said, “but I think we need to do a better job educating students, teachers, and administrators on privacy.” For students, Angela’s district provides the digital literacy education mandated by the Illinois Internet Safety Act. However, compartmentalized curricula are not enough to transform the way students interact with technology; it has to be reinforced across subjects throughout the school year. “We used to be able to reinforce it every time library staff worked with students throughout the year,” Angela said, “but now staff is too thin.” Teachers also need training to understand the risks of technology in the classroom. “For younger teachers, it’s hard to be simultaneously skeptical and enthusiastic about new educational technologies,” Angela said. “They are really alert to public records considerations and FERPA laws, but they also come out of education programs so heavily trained in using data to improve educational experiences.” In the absence of more thorough professional training, Angela sees teachers and administrators overwhelmed with the task of considering privacy in their teaching. “Sometimes educators default to not using any technology at all because they don’t have the time or resources to teach their kids about appropriate use. Or, teachers will use it all and not think about privacy,” she said. “When people don’t know about their options, there can be this desperate feeling that there’s nothing we can do to protect our privacy.” Angela fears that without better privacy education and awareness, students' intellectual freedom will suffer. “If students don’t expect privacy, if they accept that a company or a teacher or ‘big brother’ is always watching, then they won’t be creative anymore,” she said. 8. Opportunities for Digital Literacy Education for Students Most students who responded to the survey were unsure of what ed tech meant for them and why they should care. Just as staff need training to implement ed tech services with digital privacy in mind, students need enhanced education to safely use such services. One California public school student wrote: I am confused about the specifics of what my technology rights are as a student. Technology is confusing, and I know little about how my data is stored and how that affects me. One public school student in New Mexico specifically voiced a desire for courses on technology: I feel like in order to start using these devices, we should be taking courses to understand them first. On the other end of the spectrum, student respondents who were acutely aware of privacy issues were most concerned that their peers were unaware of—or worse, apathetic about—the threats ed tech posed to their digital privacy. One particularly tech-savvy student wrote: What I’m worried about most in this school is apathy related to privacy. It seems a lot of students don’t care about privacy issues whatsoever. Students’ digital literacy education will be crucial to any long-term plan to put students and their families—not ed tech companies or vendors—back in control of students’ private information. Rather than being at odds with each other, ed tech and digital literacy can and should work hand in hand, with technology use in the classroom supporting students’ growing awareness of the Internet, their online data trails, privacy expectations, and common-sense measures for protecting their privacy in an increasingly digital world. Part 2: Legal Analysis The regulatory regime protecting students’ privacy in the United States is a complex patchwork of federal and state statutes as well as voluntary industry self-regulation. Unfortunately, despite the abundance of laws nominally protecting student privacy, companies’ actual privacy practices leave much to be desired, and state and federal legislation has not been able to keep up with ed tech’s rapid growth. After discussing industry self-regulation and the Student Privacy Pledge, we provide an analysis of key federal laws FERPA and COPPA followed by a sample of outstanding state laws in California, Colorado, and Connecticut. Industry Self-Regulation Loopholes in the Student Privacy Pledge Developed by the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA) in the fall of 2014, the Student Privacy Pledge is intended, in its own words, “to safeguard student privacy regarding the collection, maintenance, and use of student personal information.”18 While it’s not a law, the Student Privacy Pledge is indeed designed to be legally enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which may bring enforcement actions against companies that make but then break public promises. This means its over 300 signatories19 have made what appears to be an essentially binding commitment to its 12 provisions. In many cases, however, the Pledge’s loopholes prevent it from offering meaningful protection to student data. The problems with the Student Privacy Pledge are not in its 12 large, bold commitment statements, but in the fine-print definitions under them.20 First, the Pledge’s definition of “student personal information” calls into question the basic integrity of the Pledge. By limiting the definition to data to that is “both collected and maintained on an individual level” and “linked to personally identifiable information,” the Pledge seems to permit signatories to collect sensitive and potentially identifying data such as search history as long as it is not tied to a student’s name. The key problem here is that the term “personally identifiable information” is not defined, allowing companies to collect and use a significant amount of data outside the strictures of the Pledge. This pool of data potentially available to ed tech providers is more revealing than traditional academic records, and can paint a picture of students’ activities and habits that was not available before. By contrast, the federal definition of “personally identifiable information,” found in FERPA and its accompanying regulations,21 is broad and includes both “direct” and “indirect” identifiers, and any behavioral “metadata” tied to those identifiers. The federal definition also includes “other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty.” While the Pledge presumably was not intended to run counter to federal law, FERPA applies only to schools that receive federal funding, not to all schools across the country.22 Second, the Pledge’s definition of “school service provider” is limited to providers of applications, online services, or websites that are “designed and marketed” for educational purposes. A provider of a product that is marketed for and deployed in classrooms but was not necessarily “designed” for educational purposes is outside the Pledge. The Pledge also excludes providers while they’re providing “general audience” apps, online services, and websites. We alleged in our FTC complaint against Google that the Pledge does apply to data collection on “general audience” websites when that data collection is only possible by virtue of a student using log-in credentials that were generated for educational purposes. However, SIIA, a principal developer of the Pledge, argued to the contrary and said that the Pledge permits providers to collect data on students on general audience websites even if students are using their school accounts.23 The Pledge’s definition also does not include providers of devices like laptops and tablets, who are free to collect and use student data contrary to the Pledge. Simple changes to the definitions of “student personal information” and “school service provider”—to bring them in line with how we generally understand those plain-English terms—would amount to more meaningful protection of student data. Potential Violations of the Pledge The first item in the Pledge is a promise to refrain from collecting, using, or sharing students’ personal information except when needed for legitimate educational purposes or if parents provide permission: Not collect, maintain, use or share student personal information beyond that needed for authorized educational/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student. After an extensive investigation, we found that Google’s educational software platform G Suite for Education falls far short of the Student Privacy Pledge, to which Google is a signatory. Despite publicly promising not to, Google mines students’ browsing data and other information24 and uses it for the company’s own purposes. Making such a promise and failing to uphold it is, in EFF’s view, a violation of FTC rules against unfair and deceptive business practices. In December 2015, we filed an FTC complaint urging the Commission to investigate Google’s failure to live up to its commitments under the Pledge. Unfortunately, the FTC has taken no action that we are aware of to date. Federal Law Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that applies to districts and schools that receive federal funding. It forbids schools from disclosing student information without parental consent, but it has limitations: it only applies to certain types of student information and there are exceptions that can be exploited. The law is enforced by the U.S. Department of Education, which can cut off funding to noncompliant schools. FERPA protects students’ “education records”25 including personally identifiable information.26 The law also protects information about students’ online activity when they are using school-issued devices, when that information is tied to personally identifiable information; according to the U.S. Department of Education, FERPA protects behavioral “metadata” unless it has been “stripped of all direct and indirect identifiers.”27 FERPA generally prohibits school districts from sharing student information with third parties without written parental consent. Sometimes school districts use a loophole in the law to get around the parental consent requirement by characterizing ed tech companies as “school officials.” However, the school official exception28 is only applicable to a contracting company if specific conditions are met: The school district may only share student information without written parental consent with a contractor who has been determined to serve legitimate educational interests. A school district must articulate specific criteria in its annual notification of FERPA rights and a contractor must meet those criteria. A contractor may receive student information without written parental consent if the company is under the direct control of the school district with respect to the use and maintenance of education records. Usually this requires very specific contract terms between the district and the company. A contractor cannot use student information for any other purpose than the purpose for which it was disclosed by the school district. Again, this usually requires very specific contract terms that limit what data the contractor may collect from students and how it may use that data. The contract should also clarify the interaction between its terms and the company’s general Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The contractor must perform an institutional service or function for which the school district would otherwise use employees. The ease with which ed tech providers can take advantage of the school official exception described above prevents FERPA from going far enough to protect student data. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a federal law that applies to online companies and is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. COPPA requires companies to obtain “verifiable parental consent”29 before collecting personal information from children under 13 for commercial purposes. Personal information can include traditional personally identifiable information such as a child’s name or contact information as well as online behavioral data—that is, what a child does online. A key question in the education context is whether a school district can provide consent to collect student data to a company on behalf of the parents, or whether the company must get consent directly from the parents. The FTC made clear that if “an operator intends to use or disclose children’s personal information for its own commercial purposes in addition to the provision of services to the school, it will need to obtain parental consent.”30 Specifically, a school district should ask: “Does the operator use or share the information for commercial purposes not related to the provision of the online services requested by the school? For instance, does it use the students’ personal information in connection with online behavioral advertising, or building user profiles for commercial purposes not related to the provision of the online service?” If the answer to these questions is “yes,” the district “cannot consent on behalf of the parent.” State Law Student privacy has been a priority in state legislatures in recent years, with 49 states and the District of Columbia introducing 410 bills addressing student privacy since 2013. Of those, 36 states have passed 73 student privacy bills into law.31 Building on comprehensive surveys of state student privacy law,32 here we highlight three states that stand out: California, Colorado, and Connecticut. First we analyze California’s student privacy law, the first state to attempt to regulate ed tech companies. Next we discuss Colorado and Connecticut, both of which took the new step of distinguishing between third parties with which schools do and do not have contracts. California - Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA) Passed in 2014 and effective starting in 2016, California’s Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA)33 aims to improve privacy and security for student educational records. SOPIPA was the first attempt to regulate ed tech companies, and several other states have passed student privacy acts that track and expand on SOPIPA in their own states. SOPIPA protects not only traditional personally identifiable information such as name, birthdate and student ID number, but also online behavioral data such as “search activity.” It may be enforced by the California Attorney General (and possibly also private citizens if they can show monetary loss) under Business & Professions Code § 17200. The law prohibits a company from engaging in targeted advertising on its own website or any other website “when the targeting of the advertising is based upon any information, including covered information and persistent unique identifiers, that the operator has acquired” from a student’s use of the website. A service provider also may not “use information, including persistent unique identifiers, created or gathered by the operator’s site, service, or application, to amass a profile about a K–12 student except in furtherance of K–12 school purposes.” Data collected on students also may not be sold. In short, ed tech companies cannot create student profiles or target students for non-educational purposes. SOPIPA provides important privacy protections for K-12 students, but it also includes significant loopholes. SOPIPA expressly “does not apply to general audience Internet Web sites, general audience online services, general audience online applications, or general audience mobile applications, even if login credentials created for an operator’s site, service, or application may be used to access those general audience sites, services, or applications.” Thus, SOPIPA prohibits a company like Google from serving targeted ads within G Suite for Education and through its DoubleClick ad network on third-party websites based on student behavioral data obtained from the use of G Suite. But when students are logged into their Google account and navigate outside of the education apps, SOPIPA permits the company to collect student behavioral data for a variety of purposes, including serving ads. SOPIPA may also allow a company to collect a broad array of browser data when students are logged into a device (e.g., a Chromebook). The law defines “operator” as an operator of “an Internet Web site, online service, online application, or mobile application with actual knowledge that the site, service, or application is used primarily for K–12 school purposes and was designed and marketed for K–12 school purposes.” It is not clear if a device or browser fits into this definition. SOPIPA also leaves questions open regarding data retention. While websites and other services are directed to delete students’ information if requested by the school or district, SOPIPA does not state a time period in which website and service providers must comply, nor does it include any other requirements for data retention and deletion. While SOPIPA leaves large loopholes open and questions unanswered, it also paved the way for other states to build on it in their own student privacy legislation. Colorado - Student Data Transparency and Security Act (SDTSA) In 2016, Colorado passed the Student Data Transparency and Security Act (SDTSA)34 to improve protections for student personally identifiable information (PII). Building on California’s SOPIPA, the SDTSA delineates obligations for the state Department of Education, district and charter schools, and service providers. The SDTSA covers student PII, which it defines as “information that, alone or in combination, personally identifies an individual student or the student’s parent or family, and that is collected, maintained, generated, or inferred by a public education entity, either directly or through a school service, or by a school service contract provider or school service on-demand provider.” Like SOPIPA, SDTSA prohibits targeted advertising to, or creating a non-educational profile of, a student based on information gleaned over time from the student’s online behavior, use of educational applications, or student PII. In a step that goes beyond SOPIPA, Colorado’s law recognizes and creates obligations for two different types of service providers: “school service contract providers,” or entities that enter into formal, negotiated contracts with public educational entities to provide a school service; and “school service on-demand providers,” or entities that occasionally provide school services to a public educational entity, or to a school’s employees, under standard, non-negotiable terms and conditions. When schools do enter a contract with third-party service providers, the law requires clauses specifying that student data is to be deleted when no longer needed for purposes of the contract, limiting the use of student information to noncommercial purposes specified in the contract, and specifying penalties for noncompliance. SDTSA also takes steps to improve transparency by requiring that the state board of education and local schools publish on their websites the type of data points collected by third-party service providers, including why each data point is collected, how it is used, and why it is shared. This makes important privacy-related information more easily accessible to students, their parents, and any other concerned parties. Further, the law requires that all district and charter schools adopt a student privacy and data protection policy. To help schools that have less local capacity, the state Department of Education must provide them with a sample policy, including protocols for maintenance of a student data index, retention and destruction of student personally identifiable information, use of student personally identifiable information, prevention of security breaches, requirements for contracting with service providers, and disclosure of PII. These privacy policies must be made available to parents and students and posted on schools’ websites. Finally, the SDTSA is unique in its explicit focus on training local staff to handle student data. The law requires the state’s Department of Education to identify training resources and make them available to school districts, a crucial step toward ensuring long-term protection for student privacy. Connecticut - An Act Concerning Student Privacy In 2016, Connecticut enacted “An Act Concerning Student Privacy.”35 Like California’s SOPIPA and Colorado’s SDTSA, this law prohibits service providers from using student information for targeted advertising of students. The law defines “student information” as “personally identifiable information or material of a student in any media or format that is not publicly available” and is provided by a student (or her parent or legal guardian) to the service provider, created by an employee or agent of a school for school purposes, or gathered through the service provider’s platform and capable of identifying the student. The law contains a nonexclusive list of data points that qualify as student information, including email addresses, disciplinary records, test results, health records, biometric information, food purchases, and text messages. Similar to Colorado’s provisions for training resources, Connecticut’s law establishes a task force to study student privacy issues, including investigating the creation of a toolkit for local and regional boards of education to improve data contracting practices, increasing employee awareness of student data security best practices, developing a list of approved softwares and websites, and increasing transparency on privacy information for parents. The law also sets out requirements for school contracts with service providers. Any time a local or regional board of education plans to share student data with a service provider, the board must enter into a written contract with the service provider. The law contains a nonexclusive list of terms that the contract must contain, including a statement that student information does not belong to the service provider, a description of means through which the board may request deletion of student information, and a statement that the service provider will ensure the security and confidentiality of student information. These contract provisions extend to ensuring parents are notified promptly. Each time a contract is executed with a contractor, the regional school board must notify any student affected by the contract, as well as their parents, within five business days. The notice must include a description of the contract (including what student information may be collected under it) and must be posted on the board’s website. Conclusion At both the state and federal level, tighter legislation is needed to close loopholes and give school districts the structure and resources necessary to provide transparency and choice to students and their families. Industry self-regulation like the Student Privacy Pledge does not go far enough to remedy such loopholes. The ed tech industry has moved faster than legislation aimed at protecting student privacy. Part 3: Recommendations Ensuring student privacy requires participation from a number of stakeholders. Below, we outline specific recommendations and best practices. After making recommendations for school policies and communications, we turn our attention to various school stakeholders, including administrators, teachers, librarians, system administrators, parents, and students. We conclude with best practices for ed tech companies. Recommendations for School Procedures This section draws on common pitfalls EFF has seen in parental disclosure forms, Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), opt-out practices, and other procedures that shape what students and parents know about ed tech in their school or district, and what choices they are able to make based on that information. While EFF’s focus has been on ed tech companies’ policies and practices rather than those of schools, it is important to highlight that school privacy policies and their implications change once ed tech is in the picture. For students and parents on the ground in particular, the distinction between the privacy practices of large ed tech companies and the privacy practices of one’s own school or district is not always clear. With this in mind, we offer suggestions for better, more privacy-conscious school policies and communication. Parents should be given adequate time to review and consider all materials. The school or district should ensure that its AUP is separate from the privacy policies and other materials pertaining to individual ed tech providers. It should be clear to the parents and students which entity each document pertains to. The AUPs should not be overbroad, and should be limited to the new technology being implemented. The school or district should not use it as an opportunity to police student conduct outside of the educational context (e.g., clauses that dictate what students can and cannot say on social media) or to grant itself additional authorization (e.g., giving school officials the right to conduct searches of students’ devices). In no circumstances should AUPs be used to waive students’ (or their parents’) statutory or constitutional rights. Does the AUP say the extent to which it allows the school or district to monitor students’ use of the educational technology? And if so, is it narrowly tailored to the educational context? Consider carefully how the school or district’s AUP connects with the privacy practices of the ed tech provider. For instance, does it say that the district reserves the right to renegotiate the privacy terms with the vendor? Can the district authorize the vendor to release student data? To the extent possible, schools should prepare contingency plans—opt-out policies and/or alternative technologies—if parents and/or students find the data practices of a particular vendor concerning. Schools and districts should avoid asserting authority to consent on behalf of parents to the sharing of student data with third parties such as ed tech vendors, and should obtain written consent from parents directly. Recommendations for School Stakeholders School Administrators School administrators are under pressure to employ technology to improve student performance. But when at the negotiating table with ed tech vendors, administrators must balance that pressure with their responsibility to protect the privacy of their students. The following recommendations draw on our own interactions with school administrators as well as the federal Department of Education’s guidance for administrators.36 Don’t accept Terms of Service when you can get a contract. The vendor should be willing to customize contract terms to address a particular school or district’s privacy concerns. Enter into a written contract or legal agreement with service providers when possible. These contracts should include provisions on security, collection, use, retention, disclosure, destruction, access, and modification of data. Critically review the terms of “click-wrap” license agreements on consumer applications. When schools and districts can’t negotiate agreements and are consequently required to accept a provider’s Terms of Service in order to use the application, they must cautiously review the Terms of Service. Because the Terms of Service may change without notice, schools and districts should regularly re-read the terms to be aware of any relevant changes. The Department of Education has published a useful resource that offers specific guidance for schools and administrators as they evaluate potential Terms of Service agreements from service providers.37 Build local capacity to evaluate ed tech services. There is no substitute for building capacity within a school or district to conduct an independent review of third-party providers’ practices and policies as they pertain to privacy. Do not rely on outside sources alone—like the Student Privacy Pledge or other evaluations—when determining which vendor to work with. Instead, draw from multiple resources as well as an independent evaluation when choosing ed tech services. Develop school and district-wide policies and procedures to evaluate proposed online service providers. District and school leadership, as well as teachers, should be aware of how services can be approved and who has the authority to enter into agreements with providers. This evaluation process should take into consideration privacy and security concerns relating to the services. Get familiar with the school or district’s ed tech ecosystem. As new services are adopted, maintain a publicly accessible list of all the vendors that the school or district partners with, along with the corresponding privacy policies and any school or district evaluation.38 Ensure that staff do not use services beyond the ones the district has negotiated with and/or evaluated and approved—and, when they do, get it evaluated and publicly listed as soon as possible. Ask the right questions. Examine potential ed tech partners with a critical eye. In addition to thinking about pedagogy and learning benefits, ask questions about data collection, privacy, and transparency. Some questions to think about include: What data will the vendor collect? Data should not automatically be collected for purposes beyond student education—for instance, product improvement. If data must be used for product improvement or other non-educational purposes, it should be properly anonymized and aggregated. Does the vendor follow current best practices in data security? Does the vendor give advance notice when it changes its data practices? Will the vendor disclose any student data to its partners or other third parties in the normal course of business? If so, are those conditions clearly stated? What are the privacy practices of those other entities? In a hardware product like a laptop, are controls available to prevent the vendor and school district employees from using the devices’ webcams, microphones, and location-tracking features to spy on students? Notify parents. Be transparent with parents and students regarding how the school or district—and third-party vendors and companies—collect, share, protect, and use student data. The school or district should not sign students up for any service without getting explicit permission from their parents. Parents should have access to all relevant privacy policies of vendors and ample time to consider whether they feel comfortable with the proposed vendors’ data practices. Provide choices. Provide meaningful opt-out processes that give parents and students control over their use of technology in the classroom. Make opt-out processes “granular,” with separate options for different uses of student data, e.g., putting information in the yearbook/directory, using cloud services, using school-issued devices vs. personal devices, using services that do or do not have a contract with the school, etc. Prepare teachers and other staff to provide educationally comparable alternative assignments and activities for students who choose to opt out. Teachers Teachers play the role of intermediaries between students and the technology being deployed in classrooms. In addition to administering technology directly to students, teachers can integrate digital literacy and privacy education across their existing curricula. Make digital literacy part of the curriculum. Ensure that students are learning basic digital privacy and security techniques while utilizing new ed tech tools, including creating strong passphrases for their online accounts.39 Additionally, when applicable, convey that the data the students submit as part of their educational activity (including, for example, search terms, browsing history, etc.) will be sent to another entity and they should therefore exercise caution in sharing sensitive personal information. Advocate for better training for teachers. Teachers’ own digital literacy and privacy training is often overlooked when new ed tech services are introduced to the classroom. The best way to sharpen your expertise and protect your students is to enhance your own professional privacy knowledge. Advocate for training within the school/district or seek out support from external resources. Get parental consent. Refrain from signing students up for services without getting explicit written consent from parents. Pick ed tech tools carefully. Exercise caution when choosing what devices, platforms, services, or websites to use in the classroom. When tools are available for free on the web, for example, it can be tempting to adopt and use them in an ad hoc manner. However, each tool may pose different risks to students’ personal data. Instead, go through your school or district’s approval process, or seek additional opinions, before adopting new ed tech tools. Find allies. If you are concerned about a particular technology and its privacy implications, find allies amongst your colleagues. Seek out other staff who share your concerns and coordinate with them to better advocate for student privacy across your school or district. Librarians With professional training and ethical commitments that prioritize user privacy, school librarians are in a unique position to advocate for student privacy. In addition to the recommendations below, refer to the the American Library Association’s (ALA) privacy checklist for school libraries.40 Lead by example with the library’s privacy policy. Refer to the ALA’s guidelines for school library privacy policies41 to protect students’ privacy when they interact with the library’s systems, applications, and collections. Limit personal information collection and retention to the bare minimum required to provide services, and ensure that it is stored in an encrypted form. Critically, the library privacy policy should also detail when student library records can be shared and with whom. Go above and beyond privacy law. School librarians’ duty to protect student information sometimes goes beyond FERPA requirements.42 For example, FERPA may permit disclosure of student library records to parents or school officials where state library confidentiality statutes and professional ethics otherwise prohibit it. FERPA, however, does not require schools to create or retain any such records. Concerned librarians can tailor their data collection and retention policies to protect students’ confidentiality and reading freedoms with this in mind. Conduct privacy audits, both within the library and in the school’s or district’s larger ed tech ecosystem. Whether ed tech services are adopted top-down by large contracts with the administration or bottom-up by individual teachers in single classrooms, librarians can be a central resource for investigating their privacy risks. In addition to getting involved with large-scale contract negotiations, think about how to ensure the quality and safety of websites, apps, and services adopted on a more ad hoc basis by teachers. Survey staff to get an idea of who is using what services, and periodically review them. Do their privacy policies or agreements with the school address collection, use, aggregation, retention, and encryption of students’ PII? Do third-party services respect school policies? Are they in compliance with applicable state law? Get a seat at the negotiating table. Advocate for student privacy at every stage, but especially before new software and devices are adopted. Librarians have the training and experience to approach vendor relations and contract decisions with student privacy in mind. When your district negotiates contracts with a new ed tech vendor, find out how to be involved in the process. Educate staff, colleagues, teachers, and decision makers about student privacy. Initiate conversations about student privacy with colleagues at all levels. The school or district might create policies and processes that threaten student privacy. This presents an opportunity to educate decision makers about the value of student privacy and the danger of violating it, as well as about how to better craft policy in the future. Take the lead in making digital literacy and privacy rights a key part of students’ curricula. As both educators and privacy experts, librarians play a unique role in students’ digital literacy education. In the library, incorporate lessons and resources about students’ privacy rights and protecting themselves online. Book discussions, movie nights, and displays can be effective; see the ALA’s Choose Privacy website43 for additional resources and ideas. In addition to teaching within the library, share resources with teachers to encourage reinforcing digital privacy lessons across classes and curricula. System Administrators System administrators (or sysadmins) are at the center of ed tech implementation, and can take the first crucial steps in protecting students’ privacy at scale. They are in a particularly good position to implement “privacy by practice” with technological safeguards on top of any existing “privacy by policy” from school and ed tech company policies. Lock down privacy settings. Do not trust defaults. Take advantage of available settings and options in students’ devices and software to make sure they are as privacy-hardened as possible. For schools using Google services, you can start by referring to our guides on Google accounts44 and Chromebooks.45 Keep in mind that products and user-interfaces are updated often, so you may need to review options regularly to ensure they are set at their most privacy-protective. Generate and administer strong logins and passwords. One common pitfall to avoid in ed tech implementation is weak logins and passwords. Generally, such weak credentials include personally identifiable information (such as student ID, first and last name, date of birth, etc.), are short or not complex enough to be considered strong passwords, or both. Take control of password generation and administration to make sure students have strong, randomly generated passwords. Even better, educate students in strong password management and require them to create a new password when they first log in. Be a resource for selecting ed tech tools. In addition to being responsible for administering, configuring, and maintaining a school or district’s ed tech tools, sysadmins can function as in-house experts in selecting the right ed tech tool for a given problem or purpose. Take notice of discussions about services with which to contract as well as teachers’ ad-hoc adoption of tools for single-classroom use. Find allies. If you are concerned about a particular technology and its privacy implications, find allies amongst your colleagues. Seek out other staff who share your concerns and coordinate with them to better advocate for student privacy across your school or district. Parents Based on the inquiries we receive regularly at EFF, it is clear that parents across the country are concerned about the privacy implications of technology in the classroom. Parents are in a strong position to advocate to schools and districts on behalf of their children. Ask the right questions. As a parent, be on the lookout for: What kind of devices, applications, and other technology are being used to teach your child? Were you presented with the opportunity to review the privacy policies of these vendors? What data are the technology providers and the school district collecting, respectively? Do vendors and schools clearly communicate why they’re collecting that data? Are the technology vendors using current best practices to protect the data collected on your child? You should be able to choose whether or not any use of your child’s data is collected or used for purposes beyond student education—for instance, product improvement. If data will be used for product improvement, is it properly anonymized and aggregated? Will the vendor disclose any student data to its partners or other third parties in the normal course of business? If so, are those conditions clearly stated? What are the privacy practices of those entities? In a hardware product like a laptop, are controls available to prevent the vendor and school district employees from using the devices’ webcams, microphones, and location-tracking features to spy on students? What are the school or district’s policies on using those features? Push for opt-out alternatives. Outline your privacy concerns to the school or district and ask for options to opt out of technology use, or to use different devices or software. If opt-out processes are not in place, advocate for their creation. People to reach out to might include your children’s teachers, technology directors, principals, and parent-teacher association leadership. Find allies. You can find allies both locally within your school or district as well as elsewhere through national networks of other concerned parents. Some tips for connecting with parents locally include: Raise your concerns with parents you already know well. Do not try to convince anyone—just look for two or three others who already share your concerns. If you cannot easily find at least two other parents who share your concerns, approach your child’s teacher(s) and ask whether they know any other parents who might share your concerns. Ask your child if any of his/her peers and classmates have raised concerns and speak with their parents. Hold a discussion group for a small group of parents. Discuss what information other parents have received from the school or district, and which other parents share your concerns and want to work together. Once you have identified a small group of parents to work with: Attend a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) or equivalent meeting together and raise your concerns. Make sure everyone in your groups speaks and collect contact information of other similarly-minded parents who may be potential allies. Contact your district and/or school administrators and request a meeting with all the parents in your group. Make sure everyone in your group speaks. Ask district or school officials to explain the process through which the current technology and policy was adopted, and how it might be changed. Ask district or school officials to provide training to teachers, administrators, and students about best practices for protecting student privacy and digital literacy generally. Lastly, see if the district or school officials can propose other solutions to your concerns. Contact a member of your school board and request a meeting with all the parents in your group. Make sure everyone in your group speaks and ask the school board member whether they would consider sponsoring a measure constraining school or district contracts to prevent intrusive data collection. Students Given that the integration of technology in education affects their data personally, it’s vital that students are especially attentive to what’s being integrated into their curriculum. Below, we provide a few recommendations for students to act to preserve their personal data privacy: Determine if there are privacy settings you can control directly in the device or application. Try to ascertain the privacy practices of the ed tech providers your school uses. Avoid sharing sensitive personal information (which could include, for example, search terms and browser history) if it will be transmitted back to the provider. If you’re concerned by the usage of a certain service and find it intrusive, talk to your parents and explain why you find it concerning. Ask to opt out or use an alternative technology when you do not feel comfortable with the policies of certain vendors. Share your privacy concerns with school administrators. It may work best to gather a few like-minded students and have a joint meeting where everyone shares their concerns and asks the school administrator(s) for further guidance. Best Practices for Ed Tech Companies Finally, we provide best practices for ed tech companies, both for providing ed tech services in a privacy-conscious manner and for respecting student privacy on other, non-educational services. Of particular concern to EFF is the way that some of the largest Internet companies treat students’ data when students use their non-educational services. For example, as the largest provider of cloud-based educational software, Google necessarily has access to a broad array of students’ online behavior: within Google's education apps, on other Google properties, and on third-party websites that use Google's ad services. Unfortunately, despite seeming to promise not to track students, the only categorical commitment Google makes is to only refrain from displaying targeted ads to students on Google properties.46 Providers can implement the recommendations below while realizing their mission to improve student academic performance. Here we draw on our own interactions with ed tech stakeholders as well as the California Attorney General’s ed tech guidelines.47 Data collection. Collect data only to the extent that it’s necessary for educational purposes. Get written opt-in consent from parents—or, at the bare minimum, offer opt-out—if you intend to collect data for product improvement. If data must be collected for product improvement, aggregate and anonymize it. Do not track students’ online behavior to create a profile on them, even when they navigate away from core educational services. Finally, set default settings on devices and software to protect against, rather than allow for, privacy-invasive data collection. The U.S. Department of Education has published guidance for service providers to use “learning analytics” techniques to improve ed tech products.48 However, the guide ignores the privacy implications of using data analytics and readily acknowledges that a full discussion of privacy is “beyond the scope of the document.” Essentially, the guide assumes that data collection is a foregone conclusion, and doesn't begin to address the question of whether data should be collected in the first place, how to weigh the benefits and risks, how to get consent before collecting data, or how to manage the data once it's been collected. As a result, service providers should exercise extreme caution before following the suggestions in the Department of Education's guide. Data use. Describe the different purposes for which various types of student data will be used. No student data, including covered information and persistent unique identifiers, should be used to engage in targeted advertising or to create profiles of students. Encryption. Ensure that all student data is at least encrypted in transit, and employ current best practices to implement HTTPS, encrypt data at rest, and secure student accounts. Data retention. Data should only be retained for the duration that a student uses the service, or for a duration specified by the school or district, and then promptly deleted. Sharing and third parties. When disclosing information to other service providers and third parties, verify their privacy policies and practices. In particular, ensure that third parties do not further disclose student information. When disclosing information to researchers in particular, confirm that the disclosure is permissible under federal and state law or that the disclosure is directed by a school, district, or state education department. Finally, describe in your privacy policy all third parties with which student information is shared, what information is shared, and the purpose of sharing it. Whenever possible, obtain explicit written consent from parents before sharing. If a service links or in any way directs students to other websites or service providers, also disclose these referrals in your privacy policy. Working with districts. Actively discourage schools and districts from bad password hygiene—for instance, using students’ birthdays and last names as passwords. Go further to implement safeguards to prevent weak passwords (e.g., do not allow passwords that consist of only 6-8 numbers.) Engage with school staff and system administrators to educate them on privacy safeguards and privacy-conscious uses of a given ed tech service. Transparency. Make privacy policies as detailed and understandable as possible. The policies should be conspicuous, readable (in plain language), available in a single location, and not embedded in Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions statements. Include at least the following points: A description of what student information (PII, behavioral data, etc.) is covered, as well as the extent to which the PII of other users (e.g., parents, guardians, and educators) is covered. A comprehensive description of the types of data collected, the methods of data collection, and data minimization measures used to collect only necessary information, or as directed by the school or district. A comprehensive description of how data is used, avoiding meaningless statements such as “to improve products and services.” How long data is retained and why. Further, develop a system to respond to requests from schools or districts for deletion of student data. Any third-parties that may have access to student data and under what circumstances and for what purposes. The policies should contain a privacy contact for users to get in touch with providers regarding privacy practices. In addition to privacy policies, include privacy-related information as part of user interfaces when appropriate. Make related materials accessible in a “one-stop shop” for various stakeholders—parents, teachers, administrators, and students—to review all terms of service, privacy policies, and other digital privacy-related information. Conclusion While schools are eagerly embracing digital devices and services in the classroom—and ed tech vendors are racing to meet the demand—student privacy is not receiving the attention it deserves. Together, our survey testimony and legal analysis offer a user-focused approach to defining the problems and risks around student privacy, particularly lack of transparency, lack of choice, and a technical landscape that has outpaced legal safeguards. As our recommendations outline, parents, students, and school staff can take effective action to advocate for and raise awareness about student privacy. Ultimately, however, meaningful improvements in student data protection will require changes in state and federal law, in school and district priorities, and in ed tech company policies and practices.

Google's 'Trusted Voice' feature keeps turning off for some users Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/01/08 11:18am PDTJan 8, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 94 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News The OK Google command is great, but I think we'd all agree that it can be a little... temperamental at times. Our Glorious Leader Artem recently took to Google+ to air his grievances about Trusted Voice, the feature that recognizes your voice and unlocks your phone accordingly. What happens when Trusted Voice is off. Specifically, Artem was complaining about Trusted Voice automatically, and seemingly randomly, turning itself off. This is annoying because it means when asking Google Assistant, or Voice Search on non-Pixel phones, the phone has to be manually unlocked before it answers.   Left: as you can see, Trusted Voice is off. Right: the Trusted Voice setup phase. This may be a bug limited to the Google app v6.10 beta, but I've found it happens with versions prior to that on my Nexus 6P. I'll set Trusted Voice up, and it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month - but then one day I'll ask it to play some music or set a timer and it'll say 'I can't do that as your phone needs to be unlocked' or something similar. Rinse and repeat. If Google wants to be the leader in the voice assistant market, it's crucial Assistant works as intended. This means improving the reliability of the OK Google command and ensuring it works 100% of the time. We'd be interested to hear your comments on this, and see if it's related to specific phones or versions of the Google app. Let us know in the comments!

Although it happened on Nexus 5 and previous phones as well. Always took a reinstall. Artem Russakovskii Your GIF at least shows the voice prompt and then the lock. With Assistant, you just see the lock, and the voice prompt only shows up after you unlock, which... well, is just as frustrating.

I have my phone in Irish/Gaeilge and Google in English (Ireland). Goyam Jain This issue has been with me on the Galaxy Su Edge running Android Marshmallow since when I bought it in November. It sucks when it happens JPJ My XL works sporadically and I'm using the Jan update. John Doe Trusted Voice isn't even available on the Nexus 6. I believe it used to be there but I don't know what happened. JasonIvers Did anyone ever find out why the Nexus 6 doesn't have that option? I never did see a reason, just that it was the case. It generally doesn't affect me, as I have trusted devices most places I would actually consider using it. Noeltorious Used to be there, and if you toggled it on it would toggle itself back off. Must've been really broken for them to disable and then remove it digitalcircuit I've had a similar issue where "Say 'Ok Google' any time" keeps turning off a split second after I enable it. Checking logcat points to "AlwaysOnHotword start recognition failed with error 14" and "sound_trigger stdev_load_sound_model failed." Upgrading/downgrading Google Search doesn't help. Frustratingly enough, this was working fine for a month or two on CM 13.. then broke. Then worked again when upgrading to CM 14.1.. then broke a month later. Nexus 6. Logan Snyder I have a 5X, I haven't noticed trusted voice turning off randomly, but I've noticed the "Ok Google command" has a lower and lower recognition rate until it becomes abysmal and almost never recognizes the command. I have to retrain the voice mondel like once a month. chinna_rao I've been having this problem with my device for quite some time but then, it just blew up when I repeatedly tried "OK Google" ing it...Samsung Note 7 matteventu "it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month" You are lucky then. With Pixel XL it happens that you setup the "Ok Google" always on and as trusted voice, and after HOURS it stops responding, forgetting the "vocal-training" you made. And there's no a toggle for this, you have to reinitiate every fu**ing time the vocal setup. Ernie Mine is fine sproc Well at least your fingerprint reader still exists, lol. Some of these issues are like Win9x era crap. ehTuBrutus Happens to me Everytime I switch between user accounts. Gives me a pop-up saying it has been turned off so I took it to be by design. I take it others have it happening even when not switching accounts? I wonder if Artemis has more than one user açcount on his phone? Andrew Palmer I used it to skip a track the other day. I didn't like the next track either so tried to do OK Google again. No response. Joe Mihalich I experienced this twice on the first day I received my pre-ordered Pixel XL. After i retrained it the second time, it hasn't happened again. Lucky me. Now if they would just fix the stupid freeze/lockup issue i can get on with my life. Brian Demodulated Trusted Voice is always turned on for me but often when I give a voice command I'm prompted to unlock my phone before the command is executed. So annoying. whispy_snippet Yep, I experience all of the above on my Pixel. Sucky. shamatuu yep nexus 6P. been turned off on its own for couple of months and yet Google seems to not care to fix it. really hope they fix it ASAP because they not what they used to be. blakeleeper Its happening on my Pixel XL v6.10.33.21 Kwetsima Maluleke Its been doing this to me for ages. About a year maybe. David Hyman Me too but it has been working a lot better for me for a while now Sharondhart Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !ue210c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Les Deplorables Yep...ages here too! Annoying. Michael Gerberich I have a similar issue with Trusted places. It works for a while and then just stops working. S7 Edge. vwnut13 Didn't OK Google used to work with a locked screen? Jimas Happens on my Nexus 6P Google v6.10.33.21. It started happening maybe a week or two ago, but it resets almost like every 2-3 days. Zaptor99 On my Note 4, I don't have Trusted Voices, I have "Personal Results". I turned it on. But If I go to Maps, Settings, Navigation, Ok Google, then the same screen from google app appears, but instead of "Personal Results", I see "Trusted Voice" and it's turned off and it then automatically turns off "Personal Results" in google app. Very confusing. Grey Are we reporting bugs on AP now? Because there are tons of bugs to report, especially with Google Now. It doesn't make sound anymore for one. If your phone is in landscape mode and you get it to turn on, it will turn on then stop because it's in landscape mode and you have to repeat it. Not to mention it does not respond every time. And try saying "remind me tonight dentist appointment at 11 am", cause what it will give you is a reminder for "tonight dentist appointment" due at 11 am. It's got issues. We gonna call them on all of it and try and get some pressure on Google to fix stuff? You gotta do it AP, we can't. Ibrahim Yusuf It happend for me on my nexus 5x on marshmallow, even updating to nougat didn't fix it. But I fixed it by deleting the voice model and retraining again. I got an answer on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/5bgngq/cant_activate_always_on_ok_google_voice_detection/ Amir This is not new. I've been having this issue since the beginning of 2015 on my Nexus 6, 6P and now on Pixel XL. Ive completely given up on that feature. opticalgenesis Same here :( - also bonus points for Muse Himesh Kulkarni Same problem here but works less than a month, maybe like a few days. Also, I don't get any reply, it's just blank (doesn't work). Peter Me: "OK Google" Pixel: "Bleep" Me: "Read last message" Pixel: "You have one last message, would you like to hear it?" Me: "Yes" Pixel: "OK, cool, cool." ... Me: "WTF?" Andre Only once this has happened on my Nexus 5X. I have not experienced this issue in a while. jack_k1 I absolutely loath saying"OK Google". It just doesn't roll off the tongue. I feel like I'm gargling. demarcmj Even if it did "roll off the tongue," four syllables is just way too much. Fatty Bunter Google Home accepts "Hey google" too, which is much better. Hopefully they'll add this to phones too. Cory S Hey Google has a much lower activation rate than Okay Google for me, which is a shame because I hate that hot phrase. jack_k1 Try using Trusted Face when you have a long flowing beard. Hah! nxtiak YES!!! My Pixel XL suffers this issue, so f'ing annoying, I thought I was going crazy! JimOnTheBeach Yes happens on my new LG V20.i thought I was doing something wrong. Shawna Bartron This has never worked for me. LG Stylo 2 Travis James I don't have this issue, but I will keep yelling at my phone when driving "OK Google" with no response. When I have a chance to pick up my phone and unlock, I see that it can't reach Google, even though I have connectivity. Super annoying. Brandon Buchanan I use this feature all the time, but never have trouble with it on my Nexus 5x. King_Android Expect bugs with Beta. Uninstall beta clear data enable using default Google now launcher and all is well. catalysto For as long as I've had my 6P, I've had a similar problem. After a week or so, saying "OK Google" with the screen off stops working. If I toggle the settings off and back on, it works again for a while. But then usually by the time I actually need it, it has stopped working again. I gave up on it and just use the microphone button now for voice commands. Van_Hammersly It's done this to me on at least three separate phones over the past few years. Random and annoying. Each time I think when I get a new phone it'll stop doing it, foolishly. Parneet Singh It always does after few days on my nexus 5 X. Ok google stops responding to voice commands dmo580 That's not the same as Trusted Voice turning off. You're talking about OK Google detection just failing. The screenshots here specifically show the toggle being turned off. Let's not mix up two issues. Yvonne Campbell I have this issue as well, where both the 'trusted voice' and 'detection from any screen' toggles get turned off. gtoninn I have had the same thing happen to me. In addition to that the most recent update to the Google app has left my manually requested google searches with voice (IE I hit the voice search button), getting stuck and then the Google App has to be restarted. Also on a 6P Pyrazol You mention this now? It's been doing that to me for AGES. I thought switching from the Moto X to the Nexus 6 would ease my woes, but nooo. I just don't use that shit anymore because it's so freaking unreliable. dmo580 You don't even have trusted voice on the Nexus 6 as an option in the Google App. Keep in mind this issue is a very specific one regarding trusted voice. Moto's own implementation of always on listening is different as they pay for the license themselves. Cypress Frankenfeld Has anyone logged an issue on the Android bug tracker? I'd gladly star it. Joe Mine's always done this, it just randomly stops working. I always thought it was just because of updates causing it to shut down and needing to be reactivated. sea_hawk I have the same issue for a month. after I joined the 7.1.1 beta and then left the beta, but still experiencing the issue. sea_hawk Never mind... just tried enabling it, and it finally let me do that... not sure what happened. But in the past when I tried enabling trusted voice, it would ask me to input my pattern, but after I do that, the button stays "off"... sorry, not of much help HotRodJohnson Welcome to the world of the Nexus 6 users. The forum for this feature says, Hey Nexus 6 user, you can forget about it! Noeltorious I actually have a similar issue on the Pixel XL. I'll say OK Google and it will wake the screen up and show me the lock screen. Subsequent OK Google's or swiping to launch from the lock screen just point me to use my fingerprint to login. Once I use the fp-sensor the screen unlocks with Assistant launched. Weird and annoying, haven't figured out steps to reproduce because it's so random I don't think it's toggling off though because I never have to toggle anything on to fix it. RecalcitrantOne Just commenting to echo what others have said, happens to me and my 5x. Wouldn't mind being able to set my own "hot phrase." Either way, the emphasis is wrong with "Okay Google." The emphasis is on the second syllable of okay, but first for Google so it's not smooth. Rob I also noticed it deactivated many times, making it unreliable (Nexus 6P 7.1.1). It's been deactivating since the summer but it's a few weeks it hasn't anymore. I hope this gets addressed. Ashlynn This happens for me. Google Pixel version 7.1.1 - Google version 6.10.36.21amd 64. This recently started happening for me. Had no issues a few weeks ago. Chris Tashjian Same here!! It's been resetting on me daily for the last couple weeks jaxjoe Same issue with my PixelXL - was working up until 2-3 weeks ago. Now it doesn't stay turned on for more than a few hours at a time Luke Taylor Ohhhhhh yeah. It'd happened to me only 4 or 5 times on my 6P in the last year, but suddenly in the past two weeks it's happened to me about 6 times- which is how I found this article just now. Come on, Google! stephen Galaxy s7. turns off in middle of voice searches and even while I'm typing in a search. Annoying to have to start typing all over again! Version 6.0.1 Niels Buekers I get this on my Pixel XL since a week or 2.. nikov I've had it happen a few times in the past on my Nexus 6P, but it has become very common in the last month or two. I'm running in to real issues with it at this point. bryguy76 I have a Pixel XL, worked fine for the first month, and then started turning off all the time. It's so annoying. Miguel Dey My pixel just started doing this.. any fix for it yet? Random! LG G3 D855, stock fw. Started happening to me a few days ago. Now this feature freaks out every couple days. Russ We have two Pixels and both do this. It's infuriating. It'll work flawlessly some days and then sometimes we'll say "OK, Google" and just get the lock screen and then go into the settings and find Trusted Voice has turned itself off arbitrarily. Trueblue711 It must be a bug with Google Play services. I'm one of the very few people with a Nexus 6p still running Android 6.0 and this bug happens to me all the time. Ronny Keller Disabling "Battery Optimization" for the item "ok Google enrollment" seems to do the trick for some users. Aaron Kelly I hope this does the trick. I'm trying it. It makes sense. Joe Mihalich This is still happening to me with google app 6.10.37.21. Kris Tyler This is happening at least monthly on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Then it makes me retrain it and opt in. EVERY FREAKING TIME. So annoying, especially when it won't dial numbers when I'm driving. It's enough to make me consider an Apple. Al It happens on Pixel too. I'm starting to wonder if it's anytime the phone restarts. SSt Me too. Nexus 6p Laksamana Just happened to me since last week (Galaxy S6 on Android 6.0.1). Kept asking me to opt back in into Trusted Voice. Andrew Slater I have a 6p on version 7.1.1 and it had been doing this for a month or 2. But instead of it turning off a couple months apart, it turns off after only a couple days. Very annoying. JC Pixel XL, Android 7.1.2, Google App version 6.12.19.21.arm64. Does this multiple times a day, multiple times a week. So annoying it's driving me crazy. Been this this since my Nexus 6P a year ago Austin Ingram So annoying. It stays on for maybe a day or two then it's off again. Austin Ingram It may be related to training it in noisy environments - if you do that then try to activate it when it's quiet it may not recognize your voice and disable it for "security". Ankit Sud It's happening frequently with my Pixel as well. Defeats the biggest use case for Assistant in my opinion. Kyle Bailey Still happening with my Pixel. Is there any fix? bluescrubbie Just spent a while on chat with Google support. They say they've fixed the issue and we'll be rolling it out in an update soon. Patrick Ledwith Really? That's a relief. Garth Hedley I have Nexus 6P and 7.1.1. so fault is not restricted to earlier Android versions. I've set up TV numerous times. Each time after phone locks, Google app voice says can't do that phone is locked. Tatyana Tatyana I turn it on and the same day the "Trusted Voice" option will turn itself off. Drives me fucking bananas. PeterDTown Infuriating! It seems that every time I try to use this feature it's turned off again. Katie Conforti Seems if you don't use your phone for 4 hours the setting gets disabled. So annoying, makes assistant nearly worthless. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en Aaron Kelly My 6p has been doing this for about the last month or two. Every 3-7 days it happens. It's frustrating. I use the Trusted Voice to dial all the time, so when it doesn't work because of something like this, it makes me mad. Shannon Doak It is happening with my Pixel as well. stsin 6P on fi started doing it after I went off the beta os test due to severe battery issues. Dušan Todorović "trusted voice" my ***. After setting it for who knows how many times, yesterday, when i wanted it to start Clash of clans, that annoying answer pulled my nerve with "actually i cant do that while the device is locked, please, unlock blablabla.." for the last time. I disabled it. Guys doing the Ok Google "magic", clearly this is happening for a while and to many people, independant of android version, root opt, device, launcher, gapps version, google+ version, etc. Either fix the darn thing or stop pretending to be Siri's competitor. This sucks big time. Simon Jude I have this exact problem! I'm on an LG K7, anyone actually know how to fix this? Paul Kopalek My Nexus 6P turns the 'Anywhere' feature off INSTANTLY when I turn it on. Even when wiping Google app data, clean flashing the 7.1.1 ROM all over again, and disabling Battery Optimization for 'OK Google Enrollment. This is infuriating. Dave Segal HTC One M8 and galaxy 7 Yvonne Campbell Yes!! It's not just my trusted voice that gets turned off but my detection from any screen. Suddenly I can't just say "ok google" and get a response without touching my phone. Rather defeats the purpose. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Another issue I'm having, but think it would be a phone issue, is that I have answer calls with voice commands turned on, and even though it stays turned on, it does not work anymore. PP Saini I have the opposite issue. The "any time" option will not stay off. I toggle it off, but am immediately able to say OK Google with my phone responding. Check the setting, and it is oddly back on. Kristina Starck Constantly on my Note 5. It also pops up a window asking me what I just said everytime I listen to anything with my headphones plugged in. Even disabling the assistant altogether doesnt stop the spam. Callahan Jason Droid Maxx 2 - used to turn off randomly, more recently I can not keep it on. If I switch it on back out to previous screen then go back-it will be off Salazryl Ismail I have this issue too on my SGS3 and HTC One M8 Jean-Sebastien Penney Same here about once a week Nexus 6p Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

CNET Lynn La 14 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL The best-selling 'As Seen on TV' products The most profitable industry in each state © Provided by CNET Josh Miller For whatever reason, maybe Samsung's new Galaxy S8 isn't doing it for you. Luckily, there are other great large-screen Androids to consider, like LG's beautifully designed G6 and Google's impressive Pixel XL. They're both great devices, but the G6 and Pixel XL have different strengths. To help decide which one is right for you, I evaluated how they compared in design, camera, performance, features and value. Read on to find out more... Popular Searches Halliburton Co HAL ▼ 47.06 -0.63 -1.32% National Beverage Corp FIZZ ▼ 85.49 -4.78 -5.30% Williams Companies Inc WMB ▼ 30.01 -0.25 -0.83% Renault SA RNSDF ▼ 85.05 -1.05 -1.22% Design: Eye candy and durability Love it or hate it, the Pixel's glass shade on top of a metal back makes it stand out from other phones. Personally, I love it. The problem is that glass can crack, as it did with our unit. Also, despite it housing a smaller screen, the Pixel XL is physically larger than the G6, and it's been pointed out that the Pixel looks too similar to the iPhone. That said, the Really Blue color on the Pixels is particularly eye-catching, and the chamfered edges make it easier to grasp than the G6. The G6's smooth edges mean it can easily slip from your hands. The glass is a problem here too: Our unit somehow got a hairline fracture on the front, despite us never actually dropping it (maybe it rubbed against a set of keys or something). But as LG phones go, this is the best-looking one yet. Though I'd struggle to pick it out of a lineup, it looks polished and elegant. And the G6's ace in the hole is its water resistance. This durability against accidental dunks and splashes is a big benefit. Winner: If it were purely aesthetics, I'd give it to the Pixel. But water resistance gives the G6 the ultimate leg up. Camera: Capturing beautiful pics and video The G6 has two 13-megapixel cameras on the back, one of which includes a wide-angle lens. That means you can get more content in each frame (great for vast, scenic shots). The 5-megapixel front-facing camera has an option for that too, so you won't have to struggle too much to fit more peeps in a group selfie. There's also a Square Camera app that edits neat square photos perfect for Instagram. Aside from a Lens Blur mode, the Pixel doesn't have many camera tricks, packing only a simple 12.3-megapixel camera and an 8-megapixel camera. But it doesn't need to, considering it's a fantastic camera in and of itself. While both the Pixel and G6 take vibrant and clear photos in bright, well-lit settings, and both have image stabilization features for video, the Pixel has a superior camera. It excels at low-light photography, takes sharper selfies and records steadier video (albeit with a floaty, drone-like quality). Winner: While the G6's wide-angle feature has its uses, I'd take the Pixel's low-light prowess over that, any day. Performance: Processor speeds and battery life Both phones are equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset from 2016. As such, their benchmark scores for Antutu, Geekbench and 3DMark were pretty neck-and-neck (you can check out the hard numbers here). And if you think processing speeds are similar on paper, real life usage (opening up apps, launching the camera, scrolling and typing, etc.) is just as hard to discern since both handsets are fast and speedy. (As a reminder though, the Pixels came out last year compared to the G6, which launched this month. Their successors, which are expected sometime this fall, will likely have the Snapdragon 835 chipset, or another advanced processor that should be faster and more efficient.) The G6 has a 3,300mAh battery while the Pixel XL has a slightly higher 3,450mAh. During our battery tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the G6 clocked in 13 hours and 21 minutes while the Pixel lasted 28 minutes longer at 13 hours and 49 minutes. Winner: The Pixel XL, but only barely because its battery time is slightly longer. It's not by much, but it don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning's winning. Features: Interface and software goodies With both handsets running Android 7.0 Nougat and the digital search assistant Google Assistant built right in (which is also available for other Android phones), there's not much differentiating the G6 and Pixel in terms of software. I do, however, like the Pixel's interface slightly better than LG's custom software, called UX 6.0. I prefer the way Google designed details like the icons, dialer and menus. Still, any grievances about the G6's look and feel aren't anything a third-party launcher and icon pack can't resolve. One thing to remember, though, is that the Pixel is on tap to receive major software updates as soon as Google's ready to roll them out. If you purchase the G6 from a carrier, that can also add more delays to updates. Winner: Both -- and by both I mean neither, since they have rather unexciting software features outside Nougat and Assistant, which they both provide. Value: Most bang for your buck  While both the G6 and Pixel are high-end, premium phones, LG's phone is consistently less expensive, even when you factor in different countries and carriers. In the US, the priciest G6 is on AT&T, and that still comes in about $50 cheaper than the Pixel (32 GB). In the UK there's about a £70 difference and you can save about AU$260 with the G6 in Australia. The Pixel's price gets even steeper if you spring for the 128 GB version, whereas the G6 has expandable memory and you can increase its storage up to 2 TB via a microSD card. Of course, prices fluctuate throughout the year, and retailers can list different prices and sales than the one listed above. In addition, retailers may offer different promotions and bundles, like the G6's buy-one-get-a-Google Home-free special that recently passed (some carriers even included an LG TV). Be sure to look into any offers that may be available at your time of purchase. Winner: Barring any crazy Pixel deal or bundle I'm not aware of, the G6 is the better value. And the winner is...  Tallying up the scores, the LG G6 and Google Pixel XL tie. The G6 wins with design (again, water resistance was its saving grace) and value. But the Pixel comes up in camera and performance. If money were no object and I had to consider both devices in a vacuum, the Pixel's edge in these two categories objectively make it the better phone. But the G6's lower price (not to mention water resistance) give it a big boost. Ultimately, a lot of what makes a phone "better" than the other depends on you, the buyer. Deciding on the G6 or the Pixel hinges on your budget and your priorities. Maybe you'd rather take better photos than have a waterproof phone. Or maybe saving extra dough leaves you with enough to purchase something else you're eyeing. LG and Google did a great job with both handsets, and the G6 and Pixel are top-notch. Whichever way you go, you'll be satisfied. The thing is to know which features are most important to you.

Using this app, kids will be able to easily create animated videos by drawing, animating, narrating, and recording their own 3D cartoons. To create an animated video, you can simply select a predefined storyboard, video scene, and a video background. Then you can add predefined 3D characters to the video. Currently, it offers more than 50 3D characters which you can use, or you can draw your own 3D characters. You can place the characters anywhere you want on the video. If you don’t like the video backgrounds offered by this app, then it also comes with an option using which you can draw and create your own backgrounds. After adding characters to the video background, you can start recording the animated video and add your own voice-over to the video scenes. You can also make the 3D characters walk, talk, and do a unique move like dancing, fighting, and more on the video. To make your animated videos more interesting, you can choose from dozens of music tracks based on moods and add them to your videos.

Note: This app is also available for iPhone, but I have only reviewed the Android version in this post. How to Create Animated Videos using this Video Animation App for Kids by Google: To get started, simply open up this app on your Android phone and tap on the big “+” button at the center of the screen. After that, it will ask you to choose a predefined storyboard between Short Story, Classic Story, and Science Report. When you select a storyboard, it will show all the video scenes (like Beginning, Middle, End, etc.) associated with that particular storyboard. You can select any of the scenes and then you will be asked to select a predefined video background or setting (as they call it in the app). There are 8 video backgrounds such as City, Space, Explorers, Pirates, etc. If you don’t like any of the predefined video backgrounds, then do not worry as you can also draw your own video background. After you’re done selecting a video background, it will open up a new screen where you will see all the 3D characters offered by this app at the bottom. There are more than 50 characters which you can use for your animated video or you can also create your own 3D character by drawing it. To add a character to the video, all you got to do is tap on the character and it will be added instantly. For each video, you can add up to 8 characters. Once you have added the characters, you can move to the next step and place each character in the initial position on the video background. After that, tap on the “Start” button at the top of the screen to start recording and narrating your own voice in the video. When the recording starts, you can narrate the story of the video or subject of each scene with your own voice. You can drag and move the characters on the video background so that it will look like they are walking on the video. Tapping once on any character will also unleash the unique move (like dancing, fighting, etc.) of that character on the video. Apart from that, you can also press and hold on any character to make the mouth talk. When the mouth of any character is talking, you can voice over anything you want such that it will look like the character is speaking. When you’re done recording the animated video session, you will be able to apply various predefined music tracks to your video. You can select the music tracks depending on the mood of your video like Romantic, Sad, Bold, Scared, Anxious, Angry, and so on. Once you’re all set with the current video scene, you can select the next video scene of the storyboard and edit it in the same manner. After you have completed all the scenes, you can go ahead and save the 3D animated video in your phone gallery. The video will be saved in mp4 format, and you can copy the video from your phone gallery and share with anyone. Closing Words: Toontastic 3D is a very interesting app for Android which makes creating 3D animated videos by kids a cakewalk. So, if you’re looking for a way to tell your story with the help of an animated video, then this video animation app by Google is what you need. Personally, I like this app as it helps kids to act as a director for their own 3D animated videos, and film it any way they want. Get “Toontastic 3D” for Android from here.

It also has been considering a collaboration with Microsoft, Facebook and other firms to develop a set of standards that would determine which types of advertising to block from websites, according to AdAge. That effort presumably would aim at enhancing the consumer experience in a way that would not jeopardize ads from legitimate firms. Google has been working closely with the Coalition for Better Ads and industry trade groups to explore a multitude of ways to support the Better Ads Standards, said a company spokesperson who declined to comment on the Chrome ad blocker rumor. A group of major social media, advertising, trade and other groups last year formed the coalition to help standardize a set of protocols for eradicating malicious, fraudulent or annoying advertising from websites, while making sure consumers could see legitimate Web ads. Online advertising is the revenue lifeblood of many online firms, and the most attractive way for advertisers to reach their customers, particularly younger people. Google and other companies in the Web search and browser arena have struggled to find ways to eradicate abusive advertising in recent years. Ad Purge Google earlier this year announced that it had removed more than 1.7 billion bad ads from its various websites in 2016 -- more than double the prior year totals. Facing several major suits and investigations related to abusive advertising, Google launched a crackdown on advertising from payday loan operators' trick-to-click ads, ads that injected malware, ads that peddled illegal pharmaceuticals, and other types of fraudulent or abusive advertisements. Two-thirds of more than 1,000 ad-blocking consumers polled said they would remove the blocking tools if they were convinced the ads did not contain malware, would not slow down their browsers, and would neither block content nor unleash annoying music or video, the Interactive Advertising Bureau reported last year. It was on the heels of that report's release that advertising firms, trade organizations, search engines, social media companies, traditional media companies and others -- among them IAB, Facebook, Google, The Washington Post and News Corp. -- formed the Coalition for Better Ads with the goal of improving consumers' online advertising experience. The coalition last month released Initial Better Ad Standards, a comprehensive report based on research involving 25,000 desktop and mobile Web consumers in North America and Europe. The coalition ranked four types of desktop ads -- pop-up ads, autoplaying video ads with sound, prestitial ads with countdown and large sticky ads -- as falling below consumer standards. The study showed a total of eight mobile ad types that fell below standards, including ads with density greater than 30 percent, flashing animated ads, full screen scroll-over ads, and postitial ads with countdown. Security Matters "This is a good move by these organizations, as malicious ads have been a good way to drop ransomware and other threats on unsuspecting victims," said Jon Clay, global threat communications manager at Trend Micro. "There have also been a number of cases where third-party ad blockers have been used as a disguise for malicious apps," he told the E-Commerce Times. The use of ad blockers raises a question of gatekeeping, however, Clay pointed out. Who would determine which ads would be allowed to display and which would not? One solution might be to allow the end user to be in charge of the types of ads allowed. Although it's not likely that installing ad blockers would harm Google enough to hurt the company's bottom line, it could make the return on posting to Google sites less attractive for publishers, noted Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at Poynter. It's "another illustration of the gulf between the interests of publishers and platform companies," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Google, Facebook, et. al., are all concerned with a smoother user interface. If there is collateral damage to publishers, so what?" Microsoft, which reportedly has been working on ad-blocking software for Edge, declined our request to comment for this story, saying it does not comment on rumors and speculation.

Thousands of links to pirate sites have appeared on the platform in recent months. Copyright holders are not happy with this unintended use and are targeting the pages with various takedown notices. Whether Google Maps search results will be downranked is doubtful though. Google Maps is an extremely useful service that’s made it easier for people to navigate in the real world, pointing the way to a local movie theater, for example. However, for a few months, the service has also been leading people to places where pirated content is available, online. Spammers are using the “My Maps” feature to bookmark custom locations with links to a wide variety of pirated media. The goal of this strategy is to have these links show up high in search results. This appears to be effective, especially since Google has started to push results from known pirate sites down. These “treasure maps” have captured quite a few eyeballs, as some of the custom maps have already been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. You’re here? In some cases, the links point to actual torrent sites or download portals, but they are also used to lure people into downloading malware or other scammy content. For example, one of the links we tried triggered an automatic download of “gone_girl_torrent.exe,” which doesn’t promise anything good. And the problem appears to be widespread, with links appearing for all sorts of content. A search for “Mymaps” URLs with the keyword “MP3” returns 44,900 results at the time of writing, and a search for the keywords “torrent download” shows 23,300 results, with a lot of popular video titles. Pirate maps Spammers’ use of Google’s My Maps hasn’t gone unnoticed to copyright holders either. Many of the links have been reported to Google, but thus far the problem remains. Since Google has started to downrank pirate sites in search results, spammers are increasingly using legitimate services to promote their content. Just last week we pointed out a similar problem at Discogs and Change.org has been targeted as well. One solution would be for Google to start flagging its own Maps service as a pirate site and downrank its results, but that may just be a bit too drastic.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ?

It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet.

The latest automaker to take advantage of this trend is Mercedes which has announced plans to support both systems. The service will be available on all 2016 and 2017 models sold in the United States. Mercedes says this allow owners to control various functions of their vehicle by simply talking to either an Amazon Echo or Google Home device. For example, Google Home users will be able to say "Ok, Google, tell Mercedes Me to start my car." Echo owners, on the other hand, can say "Alexa, ask Mercedes Me to send an address to the car." The company declined to release a full list of available commands but Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America's Nils Schanz said "Mercedes-Benz's goal is creating an intelligent ecosystem around cars, and developing cutting-edge technology to make everyday life more convenient for our customers." In order to use the service, owners will need to have an active Mercedes Me account and an Mbrace subscription. Customers will then need to link their account to the Amazon Alexa or Google Home app. The service will be launched in the United States, but a European rollout is scheduled for later this year.

The Berkeley County Water and Sanitation tower is in foreground. Google wants to draw 1.5 million gallons per day from an aquifer under the coastal region to help cool the servers after a planned expansion. Wade Spees/Staff Google wants to tap an aquifer, a saturated layer of sediment underground, to help cool servers at its South Carolina operation in Goose Creek. Above: How an aquifer works. U.S. Geological Survey/Provided  Who gets the water decides the region's future, its development and livability. That's why "water wars" are erupting in South Carolina, and that's why the withdrawals by high-tech companies like Google are so controversial. Forty million gallons of surface water per day now are pumped to customers by the Berkeley Water and Sanitation utility. Google, the marquee computer network company, apparently uses one-tenth of it — about 4 million gallons — to cool the servers at its only South Carolina data center, in Goose Creek. Now Google wants to draw 1.5 million gallons per day from an aquifer under the coastal region to help cool the servers after a planned expansion — a volume that would make it the third largest aquifer user in the three counties around Charleston, according to South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control records. The move is opposed by residents, conservationists and nearby water utility officials. It's become the most recent water controversy to erupt in South Carolina as thirst intensifies with the demands of new industries, corporate farms and residents. How the state decides the Google dispute has wide-ranging repercussions. Aquifers are massive, interconnected layers underground that are saturated with water that seeps from the surface over the long term. They are essentially the reserve tanks for huge spans of land across the Southeast. Withdrawals evidently are taking out water faster than the aquifers can replenish. And no one really knows just how much water can be drawn without exhausting them. The aquifer The price of tap water has risen faster than gold or real estate since the 1990s, according to Datacenter Dynamics, an industry analyst. The water drawn from aquifers, on the other hand, is free. Current state regulations of aquifer use are almost non-existent. "A lot of it is a free-for-all right now," said Emily Cedzo, the air, water and public health projects director for the Coastal Conservation League. More than 333 million gallons of groundwater per day are now used by industries, farms and other well owners across the state, according to U.S. Geological Survey records. One billion gallons of surface water per day are used statewide. A Google spokesman in 2008 cited the access to cheap electricity and water in South Carolina as among biggest reasons why the company chose Goose Creek for its plant. The company apparently pays about $250,000 per year for its tap water, according to a Post and Courier estimate from a report by Berkeley County Water and Sanitation. At a recent DHEC public hearing on Google's application for an aquifer permit, opponents urged state regulators to make sure the company has taken a close look at alternatives, and not give Google or any other large user a permit to pull more groundwater until a study updating models of groundwater flow and recharge in the aquifer can be completed. That study, by the U.S. Geological Survey and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, is underway and expected to be finished by 2019, according to Geological Survey staff. "Trade secret' Google has been tight-lipped about its Goose Creek operations, as it has at other centers. It has a non-disclosure agreement with Berkeley County Water and Sanitation. The utility does not release how much water the company uses or how much it pays. The agreement was negotiated because Google considers the details a trade secret, according to county spokeswoman Hannah Moseley. The company is the only one of the top 10 users that is not disclosed, she said. In a Water and Sanitation report requested by The Post and Courier, the only "undisclosed customer" in the top 10 list is the second biggest user. The top user is DAK Americas, a polyester fiber manufacturer, which goes through 230,756,490 gallons per year and pays $559,985.72. The third, Nucor Steel, goes through 111,166,700 gallons per year and pays $246,273.07. The Google aquifer permit application states it will reuse water before eventually discharging it to the sewer system, but the company did not provide details when asked by The Post and Courier. Google opened a data center of similar size in Lenoir, N.C., about the same time it opened the Goose Creek center. A 2012 report by Wired, a technology magazine, said the Lenoir plant uses giant cooling towers that drip water through radiators to cool it down before returning it to the plant to be used again. Groundwater can be returned to the aquifer after use, but some is lost to evaporation and the operation is costly, according to industry sources. There are other alternatives. The National Security Agency cools its Fort Meade, Maryland data center with treated wastewater, touted as an environmental boon and cost savings compared to tap water or aquifer pumping. Google's permit application specified that it had studied alternatives and decided the aquifer was the most readily available one. 'Green' More than 11 million gallons per day of groundwater now are pumped by public, industrial and private wells in the three counties around Charleston. The water pressure is steadily dropping, providing evidence the supply is not able to replenish quickly enough to sustain itself. Meanwhile, South Carolina and nearby states are tightening regulations surrounding surface water withdrawal. This comes in the midst of booming demand statewide and an on-again, off-again drought that has plagued the region for nearly two decades. Long term research indicates the supply is shrinking as the region warms. The torquing vise of a supply not replenishing quickly enough and increasingly competitive demands for it spurred the state's “water wars” dispute with North Carolina at the turn of the century, a legal battle more associated with arid Western states in the past. In 2013, a legal and legislative fight developed over an 800 million gallon-per-month withdrawal from the upper Edisto, sought by a Michigan-based company for an industrial-sized potato farm south of Columbia. It was supported by business groups such as the S.C. Farm Bureau, opposed by a collection of downstream water users, including small farm and recreational interests. It ended in a compromise that satisfied neither side and launched a state effort to quantify water resources to develop methods of managing them. The state also is in ongoing negotiations with the state of Georgia over the management of the Savannah River basin and its collection of water supply lakes the two states share. Data companies like Google champion their environmental conscientiousness, and take a number of steps to reduce their impact. But their operations are anything but "green." It's little realized, for instance, that the centers tend to be significant air polluters because they run generators to supplement their power, according to reports by The New York Times, Wired and other news outlets. The Goose Creek center emits more than 1,350 tons per year of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide combined, among a number of pollutants, according to DHEC data. The Post and Courier asked Google for details about its cooling operations and what other options have been explored. The company provided a statement attributed to its data centers vice president Joe Kava: "Google cares deeply about the environment, both globally and locally and especially at our data center sites. We evaluated various water options and invested in researching the impact that groundwater withdrawal would have on the community and the environment, and data from our groundwater consultants indicate that impact to the aquifer and the community is expected to be minimal. "We look forward to collaborating with the community and discussing their comments about this groundwater application.” DHEC staff is expected to decide on the Google permit in May. One way or the other, that decision can be expected to be appealed in front of the DHEC governing board and potentially in court.

Starting today, Google Maps users on iOS can join in on the fun and see a daily snapshot of their life as well,” Gerard Sanz, Product Manager, Google Maps said in a blog post. The new update also helps you to control the information that appears in your Timeline and edit any location. The essence of this edit feature within your Timeline is to help you have accurate information always. Credit: https://blog.google/products/maps/remember-where-youve-been-and-what-youve-done-your-timeline-ios/ In addition, you will be able to delete a day, a range, or your full history at any time you choose to. A variety of activity types were also added to the Maps app to enable you customize your modes of transportation and activities. Going forward, you can now easily access Your Timeline from the place cards of locations or businesses you have visited in the past. Dates of previously visited places will appear on the place card, and only visible to you. A monthly summary of previously visited places, including cities and countries can now be received by email. To manage your email settings, simply open the setting tab from Your Time, and toggle “Timeline emails” on or off. Credit: https://blog.google/products/maps/remember-where-youve-been-and-what-youve-done-your-timeline-ios/ A lot can happen within a short time, and the long lists of activities we get involved with daily or weekly may require more efforts to recollect. With the addition of Timeline to Google Maps, you don’t have to commit every move to memory; the new feature just helps you to remember all. A couple of weeks back, Google quietly updated its Maps app with a new feature that helps you remember where you parked. With that update, all you need to do is park your car, open Google Maps, and tap on the blue location dot. Google will then present you with a new menu offering “save your parking” that lets you store all the info you need to find your car, reports. The new interface will not only save your current location; it will also add a big “P” icon on the map. The dot location can be adjusted to include, photos and notes to your parking lot. Google also added a “Time Left” field if there is a parking space; this will let you set “time left” that will count down the time remaining. Once relevant info has been provided, you will get a notification from Google Maps, reminding you that you have a saved parking location. The “P” notification will remain until you hit the “Clear” button or until you save a different parking spot. Have you tried out the new Timeline feature? How useful is it?

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! TheScientists I'm kind of amazed someone hasn't already done this. It's the most basic of necessary functionality in an 'assistant'. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ So after posting this yesterday I looked into it, and sadly there's still no official API for creating reminders, and surprisingly no one has made an unofficial one either. So then I extracted the Inbox APK and decompiled it, I'm working my way through the code to see if I can't start pinning something down, but I'm betting they'll release actual support before I manage to do that. TheScientists Kudos to you, sir. I would have thought there would be something of note in the Google app apk? Or maybe some 1/2-assed way to do it via IFTTT. And, no, I wouldn't take that bet. Google is in no rush to do anything. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The problem is that the decompiled source doesn't exactly come across in a way that makes perfect sense. If a Java class isn't named in the manifest, it ends up getting somewhat obfuscated by proguard, so instead of seeing something like ReminderBuilder I end up with something named C12345, and even the classes are built in such a way that an object ends up being built up through multiple classes instead of just in a singular method, so it's complicated. I did look into IFTTT as well yesterday hoping for a quick solution but was disappointed. We'll see how far I get before either finding some options or just giving up out of frustration. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. dcdttu Once you can distinguish between users isn't all you need for reading/writing appointments....you've got to actually code that process, too. That's likely what they're doing now. So far in my testing at my house, it's quite good at knowing the different voices in our household. I wouldn't see their lack of confidence being a problem, honestly, because before the multi-user features were enabled, you could get personal information off Google Home for one user. Adding more than one user, even if it's giving the info to the wrong person, doesn't seem to be any worse. pfmiller My assumption was that they already have the code for writing data to their services since it's already done in every other application. That part of the problem isn't exactly novel. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! Jimjames Esson Well said,, Google to me ,if i have a Rheumotolgy appointment i simply use Google Calendar..!! Easy peasy lemon sqeasy..lol Blake What's an SRE? M6 https://landing.google.com/sre/ Petr Faitl I highly suspect that the answer is a highly political. No doubt it's product managers who can't agree with privacy gurus to prevent a few pranksters (i.e. one's kids) adding events to your calendar. abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Lars Jeppesen Who cares mustbepbs I do, because when I want to add a few minutes to a kitchen timer, I have to cancel the current one and create a new one with the new time. Kitchen timers from fuckin Dollar General have this "feature". abc He does. As he just said. Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. Ryan Music, pairing it with Smartthings to be a home controller, etc. I USED to use it for my shopping list, which was great. But they broke that function just recently. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. Lars Jeppesen I love mine - I'm sorry you can't figure out why it could be useful. Ryan I got mine on discount, so that helped. But I use it as a voice control for my smart-home features and to play music. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget... A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk— Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 trickytree1984 Support for exchange calendars is just as important. Most of the world don't use one personal Google calendar for their work and home life Navarr Barnier I'm assuming that MU was a blocker ticket, and they just pushed it out as quickly as they could - so reminders and appointments would be a WIP now that the blocker is out of the way. Surely.. right? right? Jonathan Sorry, but I just don't care about not having this feature, and I don't think many average users do either. But it wouldn't be a post about the Home if AP didn't gripe about it! Ryan Id use it daily, just like how I used the shopping list daily. Its a pretty basic feature that most people use (which is apparently by the unlimited competing choices for calendar and todo apps). Jonathan I agree that it's a basic feature that seems simple enough to execute and should have been implemented from the start​. I just don't think that many people are clamoring for it in their Bluetooth speaker outside of the AP sphere. And it's just getting silly and petty that the AP writers mention it in 95% of the articles they write​ about it. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The Home isn't just some Bluetooth speaker. It's SUPPOSED to be an assistive device that currently doesn't do the most basic tasks. I set reminders constantly across my phone, my watch, and in my car. It drives me crazy that I still can't do this on what is marketed as being the flagship device for Google Assistant. Ryan Or place items in Keep, like it used to be able to do. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I would love to be able to add items to ANY list in Keep. When my wife and I organize parties we use shared lists in Keep and it would be great to just add things as we talk about them. Stephen Cunningham I cant' get over Google taking the shopping list out of Keep. They are walking backwards not forward. I was hoping you would be able to add to any Keep list or add a note to Keep. Mike Jones i would like to add calendar appointments and i would like to add another minute to a timer too but that doesn't kill Home for me. i have a lot of home automation and i get a ton of use out of that. i just had a scare the other night where i thought i heard something in my house right as i was getting into bed. "google turn on the lights" and my house lit up like daytime.... it made it simple to check out the house.

Photos Videos Topics Live WI 278/9 (92.3) - PAK (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sonu Nigam Vijay Mallya TTV Dinakaran Donald Trump IPL 2017 News Sci/Tech EU mulls legislation in the fight against online hate speech Shares1 Sun, 23 Apr 2017-12:20am , Reuters The European Union is considering legislative measures to harmonise how online platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google take down hate speech and incitement to violence, a draft document seen by Reuters shows. The proliferation of hate speech and fake news on social media has led to companies coming under increased pressure to take it down quickly. In a draft policy paper, the European Commission says there is a "high degree of variation in the approaches taken to removal of illegal content - be it incitement to terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse material, or infringements of intellectual property rights". "Such divergences may be justified in some cases (e.g. for certain types of illegal content); but in other cases they reduce the effectiveness of the system (e.g. by delaying the removal of terrorist propaganda)." The Commission says it may come forward with legislative and/or non-legislative instruments by the end of the year to address "legal fragmentation and uncertainty related to the removal of illegal content by online platforms". Germany last month unveiled a law which would fine social media companies up to 50 million euros ($53.62 million) if they fail to remove hate postings quickly, prompting concerns it could threaten free speech. Facebook, Twitter, Google's YouTube and Microsoft last year agreed to an EU code of conduct to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours, but were criticised by the Commission for not being fast enough. Companies say they are in a difficult position as they are not liable for content posted on their platforms and not required to actively monitor what goes up. However, they do have to take down illegal content when notified. The paper, which is a mid-term review of the Commission's strategy to create a digital single market in Europe, says the EU executive is exploring options to clarify the role of online platforms without impinging on the liability exemption. "The Commission considers that a more transparent and predictable environment would create incentives for platforms to adopt proactive measures to maintain a healthy online ecosystem." An EU official said the Commission was considering adopting a so-called "good Samaritan" principle whereby online platforms would not be held liable for content if they actively searched for illegal content on their websites, hoping this would make companies more proactive. The mid-term review should be adopted in May. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.) TOP TOP   Comments   Also Read Sci/Tech Jio killer?

Obtaining thorough knowledge of where your leads are coming from allows you to properly revise your business strategies to further engage future clients and generate new leads. CRM management tools provide valuable information about what drives your clients, how they found you and how you can seal the deal for them and all your future prospects. Here are some important lead tracking tips to implement into your business practices today to start revealing valuable information about your clients that you can to generate new leads. Make Use of Greenhouse The first thing you want to do as a BHGRE real estate agent is to make use of the tools provided to you on Greenhouse. The private intranet provides valuable resources that can be used to further your real estate business, as well as a CRM management tool that makes tracking your leads easy. All you need to do is input your leads into the system to get started. Keeping everything within the Greenhouse platforms also allows you to leverage the BHGRE brand, which will enhance your brand awareness. Implement Google Analytics Goal Tracking If you aren’t currently using Google Analytics Goal Tracking, it can be difficult to obtain valuable information about your online leads. Google is arguably the most powerful tool online, and the Goal Tracking tool will provide you with information about your clients, as well as your online marketing efforts. The Google Goal Tracking tool tells you which campaigns, whether a Facebook post or Pay-Per-Click campaign generated a lead. By monitoring your lead progress, you can revise your business strategies to invest in areas that are generating a positive ROI. READ  Fastest Growing Companies Leading Charge on Social Media Participation Implement Call Tracking for Offline Marketing Call tracking systems are a powerful tool for both your website and offline marketing. However, this tool is exceptionally beneficial for the latter. With offline marketing tactics, such as car wraps, bus advertisements and billboards, it can be hard to determine whether they’re generating leads without some sort of tracking. Call tracking systems can help you determine exactly how well each campaign is running. When a customer calls you after seeing an ad, the system can “whisper” where the caller is coming from. For example, if you have a bus ad in Mountain View, California the system will inform you that the call is coming from this area. Immediately, you know the ad is serving its purpose. However, you’re also able to offer personalized service to your clients when you know where they’re coming from. With reference back to the Mountain View example, you can instantly brand yourself as the expert for the Mountain View area as soon as you answer the call. Without call tracking, you would first have to ask the client what area he or she is in and/or interested in. Only then could you market to that prospect accordingly, which is time consuming and appears far less genuine. Use Lead Tracking Tools for your Website Using lead tracking tools for your website will help you discover more about your online traffic. Tools such as Leadfeeder analyze your website’s current data to find out crucial information about the people visiting your website, such as where they found your website, how they accessed it, how much time they spent on your website, and which areas they visited. This can help you see what portions of your website and online marketing are engaging prospective clients, and generating more leads.  As such, you’re able to invest in areas that provide a higher ROI for you. READ  All New Mobile-Friendly Clean Slate Blog Launches with Dynamic Multimedia Content Additionally, lead tracking tools allow you to discover if a prospect has recently been on your website. For example, if you’ve been speaking with a prospective client that works at ABC Inc. and that prospect has not returned your calls, you would likely assume the lead has gone dry. If three weeks go by and see you that someone from ABC Inc. has visited your website, you can be almost certain that it was your prospective client, and that you should call them right away. Without lead tracking devices on your website, you would never know that this particular client was still interested in your real estate services.   Lead tracking is a vital stepping-stone to lead generation. With these lead tracking tips and tools, you can obtain powerful information about your current and prospective clients, all while furthering and revising your business strategies as needed to give you a higher ROI.

Whether you’re dodging through the narrow alleys of Kobe, Japan, or skimming Lake Achen in Austria, Google Earth offers rich 360-degree content, along with spectacular satellite imagery that can satiate any hunger for exploration. But Google went a step further this week with a major update that not only redesigned the interface, but also added rich textual and visual content from partners such as BBC Earth, NASA, and the Jane Goodall Institute. The new Voyager tab acts as a curated magazine that houses stories from these select partners, and it even features never before seen behind-the-scenes content from shows such as Planet Earth II. There’s also plenty of packaged content from the Google Street View team you can check out. Say goodbye to any other plans you had this weekend, as we explore all the new possibilities in the new Google Earth. This is home The first address most of us type when we see the blue marble floating in space is home. It’s why one of the highlights of the Culture category in the new Voyager tab is a series called “This is Home.” This series takes a look at some traditional homes of cultures and people most of us may not know much about. There are five homes you can visit at the moment: an Inuit Igloo, Bedouin tent, Reed House, Sherpa home, and Greenlandic Illoq. Tap on one and you’ll be taken to the geographical coordinates, with a brief description of the person and the area. There are usually three “cards” telling the story of the culture and the home — the first shows the satellite view, the second offers a Street View 360-degree image, and the third takes us into the home itself. Stories of more homes are on the way. Nature and wildlife With the new Voyager tab, you can learn more about nature and wildlife than ever before. Partners include BBC Earth, the Jane Goodall Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, and The Ocean Agency, among others. What’s neat is that much of the content is from decades of back catalogs from these various agencies, and you can even find behind-the-scenes content that has yet to be aired — such as when the BBC Earth team found a Komodo dragon in their bathroom. A lot of this content includes videos you can watch in Google Earth, without needing to leave the site. The Natural Treasures series, for example, lets you choose environments like “Islands,” “Mountains,” and “Jungles,” to explore. For example, if you choose Mountains, you’ll get a story describing major mountains and the surrounding area. Most of these have accompanying videos you can enjoy. “We’re trying to give viewers that deeper experience,” Chadden Hunter, a producer at the BBC Natural History Unit, told Digital Trends. “With this fully interactive tool, we’re hoping people will just explore for hours.” There’s a lot of content to sift through, as there’s more than a 100 assets from BBC Earth alone. You can check it all out by tapping on the Voyager icon on the left, and clicking on Nature. The view from space You can’t talk about Earth and satellite images without mentioning NASA, a partner with the new Google Earth. The space agency currently has two stories you can explore in Google Earth: “Scenes from Space” and “Reading the ABCs from Space.” The latter involves scrolling through the alphabet with geographical structures that look just like the letters — you’ll also find fun, quirky descriptions with each letter. “Scenes from Space” takes a look at gorgeous landscapes via satellite images, with a description and links to read more about what you’re seeing. To check out NASA Earth Observatory’s content, tap the Voyager icon, and head to Nature. Travel and history Google already has Trips, an app you can use to plan your next vacation, but you can use the new Google Earth for this as well. The Travel tab in Voyager offers curated points of interest in major cities around the world, such as Paris, Tokyo, New York City, and more. If you choose to explore Paris, for example, you can find stories like “72 Hours in Paris: Day 1,” where you’ll see multiple points of interest to visit. The History tab seems to be more of an assortment of random stories from the Street View team and some other partners. The list here is small, but you can explore interesting pieces such as “The Hidden Worlds of the National Parks,” and “Lost Civilizations from Above.” A surprising Sesame Street tie-in Sesame Street is broadcast in more than 150 countries, reaching more than 156 million children around the world. The tie-in here is to provide educational content for children through the Muppets, who act as role models promoting education, good habits, respect, and understanding. The first story from Sesame Street on Google Earth is called “Girls Around the World,” and you’ll find aired content from 12 different co-productions in places such as Afghanistan and India. Tap on a country and children can learn a little about the place, meet the local Muppet, and even see the Muppet interviewing locals. There’s also a lot of content that’s told by kids, for kids. To find Sesame Street in Google Earth, tap on the Voyager icon on the left, tap on Culture, and find Sesame Street’s Girls Around the World. Expect more content to be added often. Tips and tricks There are a few neat tricks in the new Google Earth you should know about. Firstly, if you have a Google Chromecast, you can cast to your TV. On Chrome, find the Cast icon on the top right and share your tab to a nearby Chromecast device. On Android, you’ll need to open the Google Home app, slide out the navigation drawer, and tap on Cast screen/audio.  There’s also a dice icon below Voyager on the sidebar — tap it to trigger “I’m Feeling Lucky,” where Google will take you to a random point in the world. You can bookmark any place you visit, and you can find these saved places in the My Places tab on the sidebar. You can also share a location with just a link. Tap the Share icon in the sidebar and you can either copy the link to your clipboard, or share it directly to Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Immerse yourself to the max in VR Got an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive? The Google Earth VR app is now available on both platforms, and it allows you to fly to anywhere in the world. You can take cinematic tours, visit featured places, and even move the position of the sun to transform the place you’re in from day to night. You can grab the app from the Oculus store here, and you can find it on Steam for the HTC Vive. Google told Digital Trends that Voyager content will regularly be updated with partners. The new Google Earth is available on Android and the Google Chrome browser. An iOS version is in the works, and the company is looking to bring the experience to other browsers as well.

Download Our Free Report Technology The Weird Antitrust Questions Of A Google Chrome Ad Blocker Google may be poking the antitrust bear. By Techdirt Apr 21, 2017 at 11:25 AM Shares15 So rumors have started flying that Google is about to build some ad blocker technology into Chrome, that would block ads that the company considers to be “unacceptable ads” — as determined by the “Coalition for Better Ads.” Of course, while a coalition for “better ads” sounds like a good thing, this Coalition for Better Ads has been criticized. It was put together by the biggest companies in the internet ad space, and many worry that it’s just an attempt to whitewash over a lot of bad practices by declaring just the extremely egregious practices as “bad.” Either way, the original report from the paywalled Wall Street Journal notes that the ad blocker might even block all ads on sites that run “bad” ads (i.e., not just the bad ads). There have been all sorts of reactions to the news of a built-in Chrome ad blocker, but a lot of people are raising the antitrust questions. Obviously, Google is unlikely to consider its own ads to be the “bad ads.” And thus, an official Google ad blocker — especially one that allows its own ads through and is default on its very popular browser — at least raises eyebrows about antitrust issues. There’s a strong argument to be made (and I’m pretty sure that some ad firms would raise this with a court within a day or so of such an ad blocker being released) that this is an anti-competitive move to suppress competing ad firms. But… then again, there’s the fact that lots and lots of people (quite reasonably!) hate ads. And a system to block “bad” ads is a pretty clear consumer benefit (which I imagine would be Google’s key defense). And, of course, Chrome (and other browsers) have had a form of ad blocker for ages already in that they block pop up/pop under ads. So it could be argued that this kind of thing is already done, and how different is this? Of course, there might also be a more nuanced antitrust claim — that this is an attempt to destroy the business of other ad blockers that are more aggressive in blocking ads — including Google’s ads. The argument there is that by offering a built-in ad blocker that handles the worst of the worst ads, users are less likely to install the optional more comprehensive ad blockers, thus protecting Google’s ad business. That’s one that Google may have a much tougher time with. Still, it does seem… tricky, to think that by providing users with a better default experience, that might also mean antitrust problems. That, of course, is where things always get tricky around antitrust issues like this one. Improving life for consumers is good… but doing so in a way that leverages a dominant position that potentially harms other ad blockers… is almost certainly going to lead to a lot of lawyers making a lot of money. But it also puts Google in a difficult position if its goal really is to stop bad advertising (and I know some will insist that’s not Google’s goal at all — but just assume that it is and figure out what can Google actually do here?). Just as in some of the search antitrust cases, where sites with bad content were pushed down the rankings and sued (and lost… but still impacted some antitrust investigations), it becomes tougher to actually take steps to improve the web browsing experience for users. If I were in Google’s shoes I’m not sure I’d go through the trouble of doing this, even if it would help in other ways. With so many folks gunning for the company these days, it seems like it’s going to be costly in fending off antitrust challenges.

According to The Wall Street Journal’s publication, AllThingsDigital, it informed that though the term of the deal has not been disclosed officially, but HopStop has been compared to Israel’s Waze, which was recently acquired by Google for $1 billion. Founded in 2005, HopStop.com makes mobile applications for both iOS and Android that covers over 300 cities and that helps people get directions or find nearby subway stations and bus stops. Echeruo, formerly an analyst at investment banks and hedge funds, who founded HopStop, is now chairman of the Board for the app firm. The move, according to market intelligence, is seen as Apple’s plan to bolster its map offering especially given Google’s recent acquisition of Waze. A serial entrepreneur, Echeruo, grew up in Eastern Nigeria and attended Kings College, Lagos. He attended Syracuse University and the Harvard Business School in the United States and founded HopStop.com after working for several years in the Mergers and Acquisitions and Leveraged Finance groups of J.P Morgan Chase where he was involved in a broad range of M&A, financing and private equity transactions. He also worked at AM Investment Partners, a $500 million volatility-driven convertible bond arbitrage hedge fund. He founded and raised nearly $8 million for his two U.S. based Internet companies: Hopstop.com and Tripology.com. Tripology.com was acquired in 2010 by American travel and navigation information company, Rand McNally. True to form, Echeruo is working on yet another venture but this time, focused on small businesses in Africa. According to him, “there is no reason why every entrepreneur should have to reinvent the wheel every single time in all the countries in Africa. My idea is to essentially have one place where a budding entrepreneur can access a template for starting a business, and then customise it to suit their own situation; essentially, a business-in-a-box.

Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976, to develop and sell personal computers. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. on January 3, 1977, and was renamed as Apple Inc. on January 9, 2007, to reflect its shifted focus towards consumer electronics. Apple joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on March 19, 2015. Apple is the world’s second-largest information technology company by revenue after Samsung Electronics, world’s largest technology company by Total Assets and the world’s third-largest mobile phone maker.

God Bless Israel, God Bless Ndi-Igbo. Today I just came back from the graduating ceremony of University of Pittsburh, Pennsylvania. There were about 150 Medical and Scientists graduates. Luckily 6-Nigeria received their Medical and Science Diploma and Degrees. Ndi-Igbo produced 5-Doctors and a combined MD and PhD. Only the Mbaise-Ndi-Igbo Man got PhD and MD. As normal One Yoruba Lady got MD. In summary, Ndi-Igbo got five out of Six. Yorubas got one, none , for Hausa and others, because some of the Northerners have no DNA of competition in their genes. Always Ndi-Igbo Ralf Bros, all hsa flni n their useless kids thinks abt are, born to rule Nigeria, control SS oil, n to join ISIL, Alqueada, alshabab etc. … Yorubas, d hsa flni slaves will always help them to achieve thier aims, tho claiming to b educated n sophisticated, which is all junk claims…So this kind of venture will always b achieved by us ,d Gods own pple Ndi igbo…Hail Biafra CHILONS If you so much reduce others , without considering the fact that others region have achieved similar or better things .like the first television was not built by igbos but yoruba.the present richest man in Africa is dangote and the same not from the igbos. Yet you people deceive your self . Ralf First television studio was built by Awo…Bt no African built d “television” ok like u falsely insenuated….Dnt claim wht u dont know …Secondly, Sir Loius Ojukwu d father of Odumegwu Ojukwu was one time richest man in Africa , an igboman..Fact…Google abt an igboman Dr Philip Emeagwali…He founded d modern day applications tht made d internet wht it is today on this earth, which u are using now to type your junk…Its not abt using wht is already in existence to brag…Wht has an hsa man invented??, except importation of rice n cements like your Dangote??..He got d monopoly thru d Nigerian corrupt govts…Is tht d greatest achievements ?..Tell me an hsa flni man tht carved his or her own nitche or achievements,without d help of d Nigerian govt??..This igboman Echeruo, did his thing all by himself, his own invention n he is paid over a billion dollars for tht, n u are comparing tht to Awo building d first television studio in remote Nigeria..Dnt u know tht countries in south America got tht many yrs ago b4 Awo built tht one u are braging abt now??..Plez b objective nxt time b4 spewing junks in this forum… Kehinde I don’t believe you are this Tribalistic in person. I believe you are better than the words I just read. I believe you wrote the above in a moment of weakness afforded you by the veil of the internet, and that’s just sad. The success of Echeruo has nothing to do with the part of Nigeria he hails from, moreover he spent a major part of his life outside the boundaries of the east (Lagos and in the US). I bet he will be disappointed with your comments especially your words against the Hausa’s. Same goes for you too Joseph. I have Igbo friends – male and female and they also will not agree with these racial comments. Like I said earlier, I believe you both are better than this. Francis Racism is a sickness of the mind. It always looks for any opportunity to express itself. It is worse with educated illiterates because they think they know more. Be it black or white or yellow or green, Hausa, ibo or Yoruba a racist is always sick in the mind! May God heal our minds from this illness which depicts each one of us as parochial (narrow minded) in thinking!!! Edward Nnadi I am along with you brother. Freeman Why should Nigerian Guardian be publishing news of 2 years ago in order to sale there newpapers. This deal was done in 2013. You can confirm it through this link: http://www.bet.com/news/global/2013/07/23/apple-buys-hopstop-from-nigerian-entrepreneur.html Ralf Dispute wht i said abt d hsa flni…Its not bn tribalistic dude….I was born in Lagos, ive visited northern parts of Nigeria too..Living in d USA now..Igbos n hsa flni can never b friends, for d obvious reasons. ..U r a yoruba, right?.., If u pretend tht u dnt knw why , im sorry..Truth hurts Justina. All your apolitical tribal perception is only counterproductive to your people and all Nigerians. That guy Echeruo will never like your antiquity tribal patronage OLUREMI if hausa fulani and igbo cannot be friends who cares you can continue to fight every tribe in the world if you wishes is up to you that does not stop God in action enough of some people behaving like the world is in their hand Ralf If u are a yoruba as your name implies, whts your problem wit igbo -hsa flni problem..?? solo la Ibos can not be friends with Hausas and Fulanis? See how your lbo Politicians are trooping to see Gmb. solo la Sorry my comment was in reply to Ralf retarded mind. Nigerian “…..an igboman Dr Philip Emeagwali…He founded d internet……” I had to stop reading your post right there. Emeagwali is an achiever no doubt but your statement is patently false. Ralf Yes, its no false, Dr Philip Emeagwali is, an igboman n he founded d applications tht made modern day internet possible. ..Google tht name…Who cares if u read my views or not…They are not for d uninformed anyways.. Prince T emeagwali is a fraud. he was discovered to be a fruad. he did not get Ph D to start with. solo la Thank you for your observations his a fraud l checked him out ten years ago. Prince T you are welcomed lisacambell46 Sharapppppppppp Na propaganda,you done hear about Innoson Motors? Prince T i am not going to sharrrrrrrrrappppp. does emeagwali has PhD??? Please answer the question by yourself. “Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree” a thourough search of his patented work showed that the the only patented work is his website. Morever where is your inventor today. I am not going to bother myself looking for innson morons lisacambell46 Jealousy go kill you,wetin Yoruba achieve if no be to dey steal Nigeria money Prince T How would I be jealous of a fraudulent person. He is in the dustbin of history today. The guy was smart no doubt about it must it patent lie. He is one of the people giving us bad name. Talkin about Igbo I will reserve my comment because my response will be bloody. When you bring it up again where I know people will read it I will respond adequately. Call em chicken or coward, I accept it for now. lisacambell46 SHARAP,YORUBA DEY MORE FRAUDULENT THAN ANY OTHER TRIBE IN NIGERIA,EXAMPLE ITT,ABIOLA AND CO Prince T Thank you and God bless you. At least i got under your skin. I know your type lisacambell46 GET AWAY NOTHING YOU TELL,UNTIL YOU CHANGE FROM YOUR SENTIMENT,YOU TOO LOW COMPARE TO MY CLASS,WE ROLL IN DOLLARS AND POUNDS STERLING Justina. Yet it does not call for crude tribalism to annoyance of others solo la Philip Emeagwali is a fraud, go check his profile online. lisacambell46 But he his where he his,you tribal bigott Justina. What a shameful crude tribal bigotry is yours. At the end of day you end up raising more hatred and hurt to genuine and enlightened members of your tribe New Nigerian ..and have you attended all the graduation ceremonies all over the USA, Canada, UK and other western countries for you to come to this conclusion? Are is that it is just facts to justify a pre-conceived notion? Tunde Hausas have nothing to show outside of Nigeria. On a fair playing field, the hausa man is finished. OLUREMI i don’t believe iheonunekwu ever attended any school in his life his reasoning doesn’t show he ever passed through the four walls of classroom,wearing suit doesn’t make you an educated man but if he ever did then that means some people need urgent assistance before it’s too late solo la Your retarded from your mother’s womb. Ayo Ademola This is a biased and narrow minded comment to divide Nigeria, you don’t what else is going on in other cities in America not to talk of other part of the world. if you want to compliment somebody who has done a good job, that’s fine, just do it and stop the negative comments about others. Nwade Chudi You can join your slave masters to deny President Jonathan second term but the factor that the Ndigbo are Jews of Africa is not in doubt .The extending the frontiers of Nigeria in all areas where there is level playing fields is not doubt. The three sons and daughters of Ndigbo have just won seats in the concluded United Kingdom election ,so we must show that we are push the Nigeria frontiers outside the shores of this country.To built a Television is no achievement but to discover is the main thing.The achievements during the civil war is no mean feat , that was killed by the present civil war alliance is APC. New Nigerian Congratulations. The world is expansive and Nigerians in the diaspora of every tongue & tribe are truly world class citizens. What you have written here about Ndigbo can be said about Nigerians of other lineage, Yoruba, Hausa, Ijaw, Tiv, Jukun, etc contributing their quota in world commerce, peace and uplifting of the human race in Nigeria and everyweher in the world. Please elevate yourself above bigotry and try to jojn those folks who definitely are not looking at issues perpetually through a tribal lens, and No Ndigbo are not jews. Jews are jews and Ndigbo is Ndigbo – If the sentiment is in being creative, open your eyes and you’d see that there is no monopoly of creativity by a race, any race – Creativity is post-racial. Much Love! solo la Thank you and God’s blessing. ASH ASSET he grew up in lagos and attended kings college Lagos,so get it into your head ,if he grew up in the east,at best he would have turn out to be importer of fake drug or at worst,an armed robber or a kidnapper leonardsonyekwere “he grew up in Lagos and attended kings college Lagos” Therefore, he is from Lagos State(A Lagosian of Igbo heritage). I accept this but do you accept that Lt. Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu was from Kaduna State? Yes, born in Kaduna, raised in Kaduna, saw himself as first a Nigerian from Kaduna, then an Igbo man. Do you accept that Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe was from Niger State? Yes, born and raised in Niger State and saw himself first as a Nigerian but of Igbo heritage. Do you accept that Dim Ojukwu was first a Ngerian before he became a Biafran? Yes, Ojukwu was born in Niger State(thus a Northerner by place of birth) relocated to Lagos where he attended Kings College(so he was groomed in Western Nigeria). Went to Britain from there and returned to Lagos before experiencing life in the Southeast. I mean, Nigeria will become a federation the day a citizen of Nigeria becomes a citizen anywhere he or she reside within the geographical boundary of Nigeria. New Nigerian We accept where the major characters you mention accept for themselves as where they were from. You raised a very important point that have puzzled me for a while – which is that when you look at history and hindsight is always 20-20 as they say, the major actors you mentioned could arguably be said not to be Igbo by place of birth, yet they are the ones who cause more problems for the place of their lineage based on their approach and the results…as their approach seemed to always been reactionary and hijacking their “homeland” for turf-battle with their true birth places. You would have expected that they should have been the one at the forefront of being able to bridge the divide and bring advantages to their “homeland”, so what is it in the psyche of these igbo-by-lineage personalities that made them hijack their lineage for personal adventurism at the extreme risk of the survival of Ndigbo. What is it that makes them fail to truly be egalitarian and bridge builders, choosing for the most part everything but, even though they have been born, bred and “buttered” outside of igbo land? Now about Nzeogwu Kaduna, yes he was as you said, accepted as such and had all the rights and accesses of being from Northern Nigeria, seriously, and then what did he do? He did not see himself as a Northerner, he saw himself more akin to being from the south east, even as we knew it was only by lineage, worked with folks with similar lineage to kill his premier….and others who thought like him and who happened to believe in their super-race also killed other premiers, their leaders in the army and leader of the country..mostly from the North…did Azikiwe saw himself as a Northerner then? No, so what did he do – he vacillated, was on perpetual vacation in the Carribeans and UK and I watched him (it’s on You tube) explain away why it was not a coup BUT that the first republic people abdicated…this after his fellow Onitsha man (he saw himself as an Onitsha man, even though like you rightly said he was born & bred in the north), Aguiyi Ironsi, had forbidden the swearing in of a new leader and sacked the parliament and effectively killed the first republic making himself the paramount ruler of Nigeria…this sent the country into a tailspin, which included civil war and other extreme political & social engineering… and things are just beginning to normalize through our democracy of the past 16 years…which should continue, we should jaw-jaw, rather than war-war.. Do you know that Murtala Muhammad was a Kano man, yet his lineage we hear is Ogbomosho, western Nigeria. Do you know that Lateef Jakande’s lineage is Kwara, even as he remain every bit a Lagosian and was an executive governor of the State…profile any leader from Northern Nigeria and you may be surprised where the lineage would lead you…so long as he accepts to be with the people and is dedicated to serve them, what does it matter, really? Do you know that Abacha’s lineage is NOT Kano? Ambode’s lineage (New Lagos Governor) NOT Lagos, even as he is every bit a Lagosian as you may find…talking of which ….Northern region has every tongue spoken in Nigeria for example, yet it was built on a foundation of hard work, faith & unity..western Nigeria and northern Nigeria, by and large, are further along I have found in my extensive interactions country wide in accepting public service from people according to the content of their character, not perfect but further along. The remaining part of Nigeria have some catching up to do even as all part recognizes the differences, and celebrate unity in diversity for a progressive Nigeria. The world need Nigeria to be strong and progressive and we all should leave no one behind. lisacambell46 My friend sharappppppppp,do you know this topic of this Article? Useless tribal bigot Ifeanyi This is a very stupid comment. I hope you are aware of that, because if you aren’t, your future is really bleak. Alhaji yusuf Chimamanda was born and brought up in Nsukka, eastern part of Nigeria. Issysmooth So why are Yorubas the owners of Kings College not able to achieve this? Bad belle, just give it to the Igbos because not until an Igbo man becomes the President of Nigeria, it will continue to be one step forward two steps backward for Nigeria. dkoma Congrats broda Sal Yarima it is not anywhere in US news. They usually associate Nigeria with filth, criminal activities and poverty. They will never show this guy to the US public. They are afraid of the African New Nigerian Not true, my brother. Nigerians are known to be on average one of the least criminal community, the most educated and one of the upwardly mobile groups in the USA. No kidding. solo la Your right we are well respected in the usa. pete Is a shame that some persons will come out here and be saying rubbish. You can only site out just few names among the millions of people who are from the so called Igbos. Beside philipe Emeagwali and this very guy whose news as not be validated yet. And you are also talking about igbos getting the highest numbers of graduate in that institute. I don’t know when the igbos started going to school. what we all know of are the yoruba’s who has the highest numbers of professor in Nigeria. They are not igbos, they are yorubas. and also the first Nobel Laurent award to be won by and Africa was also won by a yoruba man who is a prof. Now, the richest tribe in Nigeria are also the yorubas, eg, the lives of Adenuga, femi, and even the richest black woman on earth is also a yoruba. my broda shut your month up! Now talking about the hausa’s. one of the brigtest mind today we have in nigeria, still remain, sanusi lamido sanusi. i don’t know if that sounds like an igbo. and the richest man in africa, is also an hausa, i don’t know if that sounds like igbo too. the only thing an igbo man as brought to the nation Nigeria, is shame and reproach. like that of the death sentence out there in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand china, name it. both male and female. And there also other tribe out there. And with all of this, they are still not as rich compel to other tribe. Is a pity! There are still a number of them still on the death role. I urge you to pray for your tribe because is a big mess. That is why every other tribe don’t like them in Nigeria. Because they are mess. now there is a news now hitting the sky, of how an igbo man is selling human parts as a meat in his hotel. Anabra in quote! What will you say about that? Try to check the news daily. you will see how curse is the igbo race and what they have done to the image of nigeria. Nonsense! And come to think of it, the igbos call themselves the jews of Africa. So dumb! you guys should do a research on the life of the Jews. now most of the technology weuse in the world are from the Jews. Zionist in quote. Eg, mike zurkerberd, who as about 2. something billion customers in facebook. And who as also revolutionize the world via his invention. helping families and friends across the world.and a number of them that way too like the Sergey Brin of google n, Larry Ellison, oracle, name it! the isreal are the world movers and also affect lifes positively. But the igbos hasn’t done anything notable. The only notable thing they ever brought to mankind, is pain, shame and reproach. with great war between themselves.An average igbo does not have love for his fellow tribe. I do have few ones they stay with me, i know what i am talking about. So shut your mouth. Now in addition to this. No race or tribe is inferior to the other. Success is not a tribe of a race. if not, the richest and the largest pastors and great men will not come from Africa. Any man can be a success, provided he will be able to give his or herself to the demand of success. Truthwillprevail Shame on the Guardian for posting this as fresh news. This was widely published in the US two years ago. He made the front page of Black Enterprise magazine last year MindYourself As soon as I finished reading the story I had already imagined how the commentaries would turn out. Ndigbo vs Yoruba. My ‘brother is very very brilliant ….you don’t know anything’. If I may ask, what did you do to contribute to the society? Nothing, but creating hatred amongst yourselves. Can’t you people imbibe the spirit of humility for once? Must you fight over the achievements of your brothers? If this man we are celebrating today behaves in this shallow manner he may find it hard to achieve this greatness. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Issysmooth Yorubas will never see any good in anybody else. The Igbos are giving then run for their money, so they hate them. They will prefer Nigeria without the Igbos so that they will become local champion amongst the other tribes. Mikfaya ???..! You right man.! Prince Omiedo Very welcome devt but this is no longer news. Read about it some two years ago on The Engineering Network. http://bit.ly/1cP0TWs ADENCHI As the saying goes, ‘Success has many brothers’. I’m NOT in the least surprised that tribalists and ethnic jingoists will turn this into a tribal slagging match instead of celebrating Nigeria(ns)for a change.

NEW — OPEN Something needs to be done about the lack of developers and support staff or SeaMonkey will be no more in the near future. frg did prepare a "asking for help" draft for the council. He is waiting for final comments and will be post it in the various SeaMonkey newsgroups. Some users are willing to proof-read and translate to other languages before it goes out. Mozilla plans to check in l20n. Unclear what this means for comm-central and the current l10n build configs. Needs to be monitored. bug 1107635 - Rewrite build system l10n repack rules from Makefile rules into a Python script might also affect a timely l10n repack Google API key for Safe Browsing. Ewong/Callek about getting it loaded onto the build machines. Per bug 903439#c10, ewong confirmed that he has the Google API key. Safe Browsing keys are on the builders according to ewong. The build config config changes are not yet checked in. Ewong contacted Mozilla for a geolocation key and so far received no response. The Google API key can be used instead of the Mozilla key with some pref changes. rsx11m fixed a bug to use the Google key for now in all trees bug 1352850. IanN has spoken to mcsmurf about members list. Members mailing-list and council appointments are ready to be reviewed. TODO: Add Adrian Kalla to RelEng team. Overall no change as of today IanN SeaMonkey project areas is very outdated. IanN plans to update the project areas soon. Discussions and planning about the future of SeaMonkey and if we should set up own builders are still going on. frg asked Adrian about his build config. He runs a small setup: 2 PCs, a Mac and a Jumhost (DD-WRT router). 1 PC is the Buildmaster and second the server with VMs for Windows and Linux building. Ratty would like to have a try server. frg misses an OSX try server most. There would be problems uploading binaries to Mozilla servers. Linux distributors can upload crash-symbols. This would probably be possible. An infra architect is now working for Thunderbird. The SeaMonkey project has gotten an invitation to join but nothing has been discussed yet. IanN asked ewong if he could get in touch with rkent. A new TB council has been elected and talks could start. A joint discussion should take place. Not finalized who organizes this and when. Depending on the outcome builder software would also need to be selected. Adrian is in favor of Jenkins because buildbot expertise is rare. Due to cost and availability the generation of daily builds would need to be cut back. The team doesn't see much problems here and a new schedule could be worked out. IanN mentioned taskcluster as an alternative to buildbot. According to ewong and frg it looks complex and Mozilla specific. The Thunderbird project plans to hire a designer for a new build infrastructure in the near future. There are plans by Mozilla to do cross compiles on Linux for Windows and macOS. Not finalized yet. — CLOSED Google announced V4 of the safebrowsing api. Firefox adds support for it in bug 1167038 which is now mostly fixed. I think the part can be removed for now. Works in SeaMonkey. No additional preferences are needed but for the V4 lists the Googgle API key needs to be on the server. The initial blocklists (unrelated item) were taken care of in bug 1358750. — Status of the SeaMonkey Buildbot Master and Tree Various Bugs open for building. OSX64: busted due to bug 1260362. Yasm 1.2 needs to be installed. (Ratty: Depends on bug 1257904. How to get traction on this?) Perma-busted-red: bug 958812 Linux64 Nightly: bug 1275215 is still open but Linux is building most of the time. Linux64 build: bug 1275218 is still open but Linux is building most of the time. Windows building is done on the loaner. Various l10n and other bugs bug 1293943 which might also impact the release schedule. CZ langpacks seem to be disabled by default, so that needs to be sorted. DOMi still needs to be sorted. Lightning l10n upload still needs to be sorted. [2nd Apri 2017] Tests have been re-enabled to enable us to find out what's busting them. bug 1295826 tracks the fixes for the Testing Infrastructure. All tests are red. [comm-central]: All platforms: green See bug 1345770 for current breakages. bug 1344411 - 'Lightweight themes are not supported anymore in SeaMonkey' needs a helping hand. If we just port the Firefox build the titlebar will be overwritten by some themes. [comm-aurora]: DISCONTINUED — "Project Dawn" bug 1354818 Linux*: Green OSX64: Orange/Green See bug 1334779 for current breakages. [comm-beta] Pretty much Green/Orange. See bug 1319091 for current breakages. [comm-release]: Pretty much Green/Orange. See bug 1313304 for current breakages. [comm-esr52]: No automation. [Filed bug 1352820] Broken by uplift of bug 1299500 which also affects Thunderbird and Firefox. Notes: Ewong did set up a cron job to do semi regular builds on the loaner machine. The MAC builders can be updated to OSX 10.9. He needs to consult with Callek first about this. Windows nightly trunk builds are only done on the loaner. Migrating our Windows builders to Win2008 R2 will likely never happen. Callek: Regarding the windows systems, sadly no progress yet. I'm hopeful we can get done sooner than later, I'm realistic expecting it won't be any time soon. Langpacks aren't updated when auto-updating SeaMonkey because they aren't uploaded to AMO. The solution requires changes in SeaMonkey RelEng (and possibly AMO). wrt bug 1155011, we already have a Soccoro token. The patches on bug 1155013 require approval and then pushed and the work-around patches backed out. See RelEng page for the RelEng status history. Fixed Stuff Since Last Meeting — Release Train SeaMonkey 2.48 beta 1 released April 15, 2017 — kudos to ewong! SeaMonkey 2.48 will be the next release tracked in bug 1351984 (general beta issues in bug 1328886) Updates from 2.39b1 apparently did not work, relevant for the 2.48 release to upgrade from 2.46 without problems. l10n problems from 2.46 are still not solved. Extensions again can not be shipped bundled with this release. A removal patch has been checked in. DOMi and cZ tags have nevertheless been updated for a future release. l10n problem is tracked in (bug 1231349). Chatzilla and DOMi repack problems are also tracked in bug 1315552. IanN has locale merge working for Chatzilla and is working on the DOMi repack issues. See also bug 652063 (Enable localized ChatZilla builds). Release notes in bug 1336315. gtk3 will be disabled for beta and likely release builds. There are at least three problems with gtk3 builds which may not be resolved in time (bug 1269145, bug 1267982, bug 1331208). A regression for gtk2 builds since 2.40 has been identified but is limited to certain desktop themes and doesn't seem to affect the most current OS version (bug 1312215). Building releases with gtk2 is only a short time solution and will no longer be possible with Gecko 53 (SM 2.50, thus would still allow 2.49 gtk2 builds). Probably a meta bug for gtk3 compatibility should be created. SeaMonkey 2.49 will be build with ALSA support. This has been disabled in Firefox 52 and causes problems for Linux users (see discussion in bug 1345661). Because of the following bugs updates need to be tested if they are still working: bug 1274722 Add %SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES% to the SeaMonkey app.update.url preference bug 1271761 Add CPU features/detection to update URL 2.48 is still 'lightly' blocked on our ability to migrate from AUS2 to Balrog as the above mentioned bugs might be difficult with AUS2. bug 1254401 frg mentioned that the 2.48 is getting late and if we should jump directly to 2.49 after the 2.48 beta which is mostly done now for getting the migration to balrog tested. ewong wants a stable 2.48 release as an interim to further test the migration work. Discussions if we should match minor version numbers with Firefox are still underway. This would need a coordinated change for either c-c or all trees. All minor versions would be changed and the versions would need to be made available in bugzilla. Lightning version calculation needs to be changed. This will be done at a later date and not for 2.49 ESR. The aurora channel is discontinued per last merge on April 18 (bug 1353821, bug 1354818) comm-central stays on SeaMonkey 2.52 and will merge directly into comm-beta around June 12. ewong: Suggests the following: Officially release a linux64 build (incl. tests) Start with comm-central trunk. Not entirely sure what is needed to make it official. Need to correspond with Callek. Build an unofficial (contributed build) Win64 build. [akin to the status that Linux64 has now.] Start later with comm-central we need to iron out the build issues, though right now, having just finished a W64 build; but I don't know how the tests are going to work though this will need to wait). Currently tracked by bug 482143. Current plan is to do releases off comm-esr52. No current backup plan other than continue building off comm-release. Firefox plans removal of non-WebExtension add-ons and full-theme support with Gecko 57 [1]. Patches which do not concern Thunderbird could be checked into comm-esr52 (once established) after getting approval too. rsx11m filed bug 1358148 to get status and approval flags added in bugzilla for SeaMonkey Useful Firefox Release Schedule link: Releases Scheduling Extensions and Plugins Compatibility Tracking SeaMonkey Council is looking into setting up a separate add-ons site for SeaMonkey extensions. This would fix long standing issues we have with AMO. Ratty and IanN will meet with the AMO people to discuss this. Ratty and IanN will meet with the Thunderbird people to discuss this. [Ratty] Suggests that if we do this, we can also host the Firefox & Thunderbird Add-on Converter for SeaMonkey. Firefox plans removal of non-WebExtension add-ons and full-theme support with Gecko 57 [2]. new add-ons other than WebExtensions will no longer be accepted for signing as early as Gecko 53. See Basics page. Please only list current changes here. Firefox & Thunderbird Add-on Converter for SeaMonkey http://addonconverter.fotokraina.com/ This tool goes a little further beyond simply modifying install.rdf - it also identifies a few more other things in the code that are Firefox or Thunderbird specific and attempts to change them. Of course, not all extensions can be ported so easily to SeaMonkey since there's only so much an automated tool like that can do. We are looking for a better(?) home for extension-converter pages, along with a way to track successful and conversion-failed add-ons, and respective integration into SeaMonkey by add-on or manager overlay [3], bug 1145026. Ratty filed bug 1130390 to add a link on seamonkey-projects.org to the Firefox & Thunderbird Add-on Converter for SeaMonkey. The AMO Browsing for SeaMonkey extension, which makes AMO pages a lot more SeaMonkey-friendly, is mature. It was developed by LemonJuice (of Add-on Converter fame), and Tonymec, who tested it and now uses it, supports it enthusiastically. The author proposes to add it as a "built-in extension" besides ChatZilla, DOMi and the like. What do you think? (See also Bug 1145026: AMO Add-On-Descriptions: Add link function leading to SeaMonkey add-on-converter and filling URL input pane; the extension actually does much more than the bug's Summary implies: for instance it gets rid of the stupid "You need Firefox 10 or later" popups. The HTML Validator adds HTML validation to SeaMonkey. The Beta version is no more Windows-only: it boasts support for W32/64, L32/64 and Mac 32/64 Universal in a single XPI. It does not officially support trunk builds but in Tonymec's experience it worked with them last year. It offers a choice of validators: Tidy, SGML (same algorithm as the W3C validator but client-side) or both. Caveat: The toolbar button gives no results for HTML5, you need View Source for that. See the developer's site for details. In Gecko 52 obsolete toolkit parts were removed in bug 1312143. This may cause problems with older add-ons when SeaMonkey 2.49 hits the road. The 2.49 release notes should mention it. Chatzilla and DOMi were affected and were fixed. 2.x (Last, Current, Next) SeaMonkey Statistics can be viewed at https://dataviz.mozilla.org Across all channels we have an approximate ADU of 120k. Ratty suggests embedding these graphs somewhere on seamonkey-projects.org or https://dev.seamonkey.at bug 1133728 Look at embedding dataviz information into the SeaMonkey website. Links are broken again. Dataviz views now needs a SSO login. We need to find out how to expose a limited view for public consumption bug 1173006. See Basics page for the usual reminders. 2.46 current release open tracking (0) tracking requests (1) targeted (0) fixed (27) 2.47 skipped open tracking (0) tracking requests (1) targeted (0) fixed (15) 2.48 planned next release open tracking (0) tracking requests (3) targeted (1) fixed (23) 2.Next We need someone to work on porting sync 1.5 over to replace legacy sync code. Frg was distracted by other bugs and tasks and didn't look into it yet. See: New Firefox Sync has landed in Firefox Nightly. Tracked in: bug 998807 Sync account creation or device pairing fails with exception in BrowserIDManager. bug 1003434 Add support for about:sync-progress. As an alternative to porting sync setting up a sync 1.1 server might work. Sync 1.1 has been removed from the mozilla source tree. If we want sysnc 1.1 to work we need to fork it. Pro: We control our own sync server and are not left at the mercies of Mozilla the next time they change their sync system. Con: Can't sync with Firefox (unless someone writes a Sync 1.1 client for Firefox). Stalled. Needs a kick: bug 815954 Click-to-Play: Port bug 812562 (click-to-play blocklisted plugins: reshow urlbar notification as with normal click-to-play). bug 476108 GetShortPathNameW fails under some NTFS junctions [patchlove]. Current breakages: — Mozilla-central bugs that affect us: bug 1298243 'drag/drop: DataTransfer.types is wrong type'. Building SeaMonkey still works but changes probably need to be ported. bug 1276739 'replace list.txt with a region-aware JSON file format to allow different search configs...'. Regressions for SeaMonkey are tracked in bug 1300198. bug 1300198 Move list.txt over to JSON once bug 1276739 is in. This will likely break search engines and needs to be looked at. A lot of these bugs are due to mozilla-central switching from synchronous APIs to Asynchronous APIs. bug 566746 (asyncFormHistory) Form history should use asynchronous storage API has been checked in and broke SeaMonkey 2.51. Tracked in: bug 912031 Use Asynchronous FormHistory.jsm in place of nsIFormHistory2 in Suite. Currently being worked on by IanN and frg for the Data Manager part. The C++ downloads manager backend nsIDownloadManager is being decommissioned. Firefox and Thunderbird have migrated to jsdownloads. bug 825588 Asynchronous JavaScript API for downloads and bug 851471 Decommission nsIDownloadManager. Tracked in: bug 888915 Move SeaMonkey to the new JavaScript API for downloads when nsIDownloadManager is decommissioned. frg is currently looking into the patch from Neil. [adriank] would like to drop DOMi or at least not bundling it with release builds in bug 1273222. Open for discussion. [rsx11m] did open bug bug 1305902 for certificate pinning. Discussion if it should be enabled for SeaMonkey is still underway. Callek commented in the bug. Feature List, Planning Bug statistics for the last two (full) weeks: 13 new, 5 fixed, 3 triaged. low triaging effort, low number of new bugs filed. Open reviews/flags: 36 review 5 super-review 1 ui-review 13 feedback See Feature List page for major wanted/needed features. TODO: Encrypted Media Extensions / Digital Rights Management bug 1127784 added a preference and UI to enable/disable playback of Encrypted Media Extensions, with UI seen in non-release builds only More work appears to be needed to download necessary 3rd-party Content Decryption Modules, some UI can probably be ported from Firefox Mozilla wants to Move Thunderbird off MoCo infrastructure and onto their own, which will likely affect SeaMonkey as well [Ratty:] Rkent - Thunderbird leader - would like SeaMonkey to join Thunderbird in this move. This might fix our problem with lack of builders and our PERMA-CLOSED trees due to this lack. discussions in mozilla.governance, mozilla.dev.apps.seamonkey, tb-planning, blog.lizardwrangler.com Blog post Firefox and Thunderbird: A Fork in the Road Separating the infrastructure: Build and release: Mozilla's offer. More recent posts/discussions: Firefox and Thunderbird: A Fork in the Road - Mark Surman Build and release: Mozilla's offer (on tb-planning) SeaMonkey Council is looking into setting up a separate add-ons site for SeaMonkey extensions. Check to see what Thunderbirds plan is. We might be able to share costs by sharing on add-ons site for both or even all three comm-central applications (Instantbird). Fundamental core features Firefox/Mozilla plans to remove: bug 1222546 Product plan: remove support for heavyweight themes If effective for all Toolkit applications, would render most 3rd-party themes defunct. Discussion diverted to https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/planning-the-future-of-complete-themes/ No news about it till now but will likely come with Firefox 57. Unclear if at first it can be pref controlled. Rainer started a Coffee-Mug-Competition. Please let any developers you know to it and post a big Help wanted! sign. SeaMonkey Composer is outdated. Ratty thinks that using backports or parts of KompoZer [4] might solve some of the problems. x64 Linux and for the first time x64 Windows builds will be made official as soon as possible. Unofficial Linux builds just need to be declared official. Providing Windows x64 builds is tracked in bug 482143. The website and wiki are outdated. InvisibleSmiley no longer maintains the website. For 2.46 the website was updated but it still needs work. bug 1253932 tracked the relnotes for 2.40 and could be used as a start point. mcsmurf knows how to change the site. frg suggested asking for donations in a future release. Probably during startup or more prominently on the website. frg suggested a tabbrowser.xml overhaul because it's becoming harder to backport fixes from Firefox. IanN suggests doing small patches which are easier to review. Roundtable - Personal Status Updates IanN will handle review requests. Ratty is currently absent. Status Updates from developers - what are you working on, what's the progress, any other comments? (feel free to add yourself to the list if your name is missing and you have interesting status).

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Name: Subject: Message: You can remap the Galaxy S8 Bixby button to Google Assistant again Newsby Kris Carlon14 hours ago 46 1160 71 As the saying goes, when the world gives you lemons, make lemonade. Or in this case, when Samsung gives you Bixby, make your own app to remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant. After Samsung’s blocking update – which has also caused problems for multiple users with a “DQA keeps stopping” error message – the ability to remap the Bixby button went with it. Until a Redditor by the name of Dave Bennett came along. He decided to write a basic app to bypass Samsung’s blockade by simply launching Google Assistant over the top of Bixby whenever the button is pressed. As such, you’ll see a quick flash of Bixby before Assistant elbows it out of the way to give you its more useful feature set, you know, like actual voice commands. What’s even better is that there’s absolutely nothing to it either, no root, no ADB commands, no anything. Simply install the BixRemap app from Google Play via the button below, flip the switch in Usage Data Access and then hit the big old Start Service button. Note that following Samsung’s latest update some S8 owners are no longer able to call up Bixby with a single press or the dedicated button, so you might need a double press instead. INSTALL BIXREMAP It’s not a very elegant solution and means that you’ll have both Bixby and Assistant running on top of each other, but until a more polished fix comes (I’m sure there are more than a few devs working on it as we speak) it’ll suffice. Several other Redditors have suggested the app be updated to lower its priority settings to remove the persistent status bar icon and to add a launch at boot option. Bennett seems to be open to the ideas so keep your eyes peeled for that update.

Most probably, this feature will be turned on by default for all users. However, Google has not announced any information regarding this feature. According to The Wall Street Journal, Google is working to launch its own ad-blocking feature. As mentioned above, it would be enabled by default within the mobile and desktop versions of its Chrome web browser. Moreover, this feature could be announced officially within weeks. But this is not confirmed yet. Although Google’s revenue is dependent on online advertisements, this move seems like a counter initiative. By the launch of this feature,  the search giant wants to two things out of this. One is to provide better user experiences and the second is to put an end to the growth of third-party ad-blocking add-ons. Third-party apps and add-ons have seen significant growth over the last few years. Google and other major tech giants earn a huge share of revenue from electronic advertisements. These companies target their relevant audiences through marketing advertisements put on the websites. To run their day-to-day tasks, these companies need funds. So these companies strongly discourage the usage of third-party ad-blockers. Currently, Google declined to comment on the matter. So we can’t say anything about the launch of this feature. Moreover, the reason of launching this feature is still unclear. May be Google wants to help its users to improve their experience by not using third party ad-blockers. Let’s see whether Google has to launch this feature or not.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Alphabet and Apple: 2 of the Best Healthcare Stocks on the Market? Every company is a healthcare company now. At least, that’s what it seems like sometimes. Both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  are working on technology to help manage diabetes and address other healthcare issues. Could Alphabet and Apple now be considered two of the best healthcare stocks around? Maybe so. Image source: Getty Images. Teaming up Alphabet has a couple of companies focusing on healthcare — Calico and Verily. And these companies have forged partnerships with some big established healthcare companies along the way. Calico was formed in 2013 to develop technologies that increase the human lifespan. The following year, AbbVie teamed up with Calico, investing $750 million to try to bring new therapies to market for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. In late 2015, Google Life Sciences changed its name to Verily Life Sciences. Verily is working with Dexcom (NASDAQ: DXCM) to develop miniaturized continuous glucose monitors for type 2 diabetic patients. It formed a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to create bioelectronic medicines that use tiny implanted devices to treat disease. The Alphabet business unit also formed other joint ventures with Johnson & Johnson to develop robotic surgical systems and with Sanofi to create technology that helps diabetic patients better manage their health. Perhaps the most intriguing project that Verily is working on is its effort with Novartis to develop a smart contact lens that senses glucose level in tears. The goal is to have contact lenses that change color if diabetic patients’ glucose levels aren’t where they need to be. No pain, big gain CNBC recently reported that Apple has a secret initiative underway that’s trying a different approach in monitoring glucose levels. Currently, patients must use finger sticks that pierce their skin four times per day to monitor their glucose levels. Apple’s team is trying to develop a solution that uses optical sensors instead. The ultimate goal is to fulfill Apple founder Steve Jobs’ vision of wearable devices that could continually monitor important vital signs. Apple Watch already enables monitoring of heart rates. Apple has applied for a patent to send alerts to family or emergency staff if an Apple Watch wearer has heart problems, such as arrhythmia. However, monitoring glucose in a completely non-invasive way has been impossible so far. Dexcom does have a continuous glucose monitoring system that interfaces with Apple Watch. However, the system uses a sensor that is placed underneath the skin. It also requires a minimum of two finger sticks each day for calibration. Apple’s hope appears to be to eliminate the need for finger sticks entirely. Apple is looking at other healthcare opportunities as well. Bloombergreported last year that the company intends to transform its HealthKit app that runs on iPhones and Apple Watches from a primarily fitness application to a tool that helps improve diagnoses. Apple also bought a small company in early 2016, Gliimpse, which is developing software that stores electronic health records from multiple sources in one place. Top healthcare picks? There’s no question that both Alphabet and Apple are trying to solve some of the most challenging problems in healthcare. But are the stocks good choices for investors wanting to profit from the growth in the healthcare industry? Yes and no. The negative response isn’t because Alphabet and Apple aren’t solid stock picks. They are. However, in the near term, neither company will generate enough revenue from healthcare to rank the stocks among the best ways to ride the healthcare wave. On the other hand, investors should look at the long run. If Alphabet and Apple are successful in achieving their goals, the financial opportunities in healthcare for both companies are enormous. The diabetes testing market could reach $17 billion by 2021. If Alphabet’s smart contact lens pans out and Apple’s optical sensor technology works, the two technology giants could also become healthcare giants. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 100 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares196 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate...

He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off. Rest of the settings are stock out of the box. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d6d107fe72843084747728a2ff7d6ed0c69dbb8828498d680a8e574909c8d80.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/69216e0f531ae12996c1fea6d785844e4b1d5cb6f74e5a1f1b39973b6d6f25d5.png Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You can also get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. The producers of “Sesame Street” show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture. Separately, a new “I’m Feeling Lucky” feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken,, part of a marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. Tuesday’s update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or “getting lost.” Sunday <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=300&h=250&posid=31&x=js'></script> <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=300&h=250&posid=55&x=js'></script> Most Read Today Weekly Monthly Man executed for killing two young women, raping corpse Chinese air pollution inspectors find problems in 2,808 companies China's cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-1 docks with Tiangong-2 space lab Two heroin smugglers arrested in Yunnan China's personal mortgages decrease in Q1 China launches reform of Chinese 'green cards' One highly suspect piece of baggage One killed and two injured as bus veers onto sidewalk Lovers, Locked In Embrace In The Middle Of The Road, Hit By Drunk Driver Yet again public reveals distaste for taxi industry French bakery executives held and all outlets closed in stale flour raid Mental patient held for stabbing wardmates to death with chopstick Shanghai plans to build airport No. 3 New traffic rules attempt to break Shanghai’s hierarchical traffic system China launches reform of Chinese 'green cards' <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=125&h=125&posid=21&x=js'></script> <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=160&h=600&posid=20&x=js'></script> Latest News Voting begins in French presidential election Three dead in east China landslide Horses arrive in Shanghai for upcoming equestrian competition Diet drinks may triple your risk of stroke, dementia: study Pigeon pair giant panda cubs named 'Ban Ban', 'Yue Yue' View more » Latest Sunday News Last orca born at San Antonio’s SeaWorld Idyllic place to do nothing in style Exhibits by Dutch artists ‘Gifted’ relies on movie formula The man behind the landmark The ‘four evils’ are still out there View more » °C | °F Shanghai Weather Loading...

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Apr 23, 2017 - Page 16　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Google and partners try to block online ad blockers COALITION:A large group of digital advertising firms led by Google are to help set standards on ‘acceptable’ ads, but giants such as Apple and Mozilla are not members Bloomberg After seven months of work, the biggest digital advertising companies think they have a solution to the existential threat of consumers blocking online ads. Google, the biggest player in this industry, is at the center of the plan, although the company and its partners are keen to present the initiative as a group effort. The Coalition for Better Ads published a list of undesirable online ads earlier this year. Google plans to add a feature to its Chrome Web browser that would disable those ads. The feature is designed for publishers, rather than a tool for consumers, and would operate the same way Chrome already filters ads that are undesirable in other ways, such as those that drain computer batteries, people familiar with the plans said. The Wall Street Journal earlier this week first reported on Google’s potential decision, sparking criticism that the search ad giant was again exerting too much control over the market for digital ads. Now industry partners are stressing that the plan is a group effort and not finalized. They also distanced Google’s tool from existing ad blockers that prompted the initiative in the first place. “There is no ad blocker that’s going into a browser,” trade group Interactive Advertising Bureau head Randall Rothenberg said, although he would not offer further details on the tool. “What we want is something that’s industry-wide, that can demonstrably improve user experience and that’s embraced by pretty much everyone.” Rothenberg helped set up the Coalition for Better Ads in September last year. Beyond Google, members include some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, media organizations and Facebook Inc. Last month, the group issued its list of ad units — including those that take over entire screens or videos that start automatically — that it claimed are most likely to prompt people to download ad blockers. The Chrome option is different from ad blockers, which are downloaded as mobile apps or Web browser plug-ins to zap most marketing messages, people familiar with the plans said. Instead, it might look like similar tools that Google builds into its browser. Last fall, Chrome began automatically disabling ads that use Flash multimedia, citing computer battery drain. People in the coalition said they expect Google to also hold its own search, display and YouTube ads to the same standards it imposes on the rest of the industry, although the terms have not been finalized. Google declined to comment on potential Chrome features. However, the company emphasized that its plans are part of a group effort. “Google alone cannot solve for the incentives users have to install ad blockers,” a company spokeswoman said. “We need an industry approach that is data-driven and endorsed by everyone.” Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for Venable LLP, which counsels the Coalition for Better Ads, said the group is still months away from issuing policies on “acceptable” ad standards. “All the options are on the table,” he said. Leaders of the coalition said other tech companies, such as Microsoft Corp and Facebook, would be involved in setting standards. “Something that’s only one browser is not really worth it,” Rothenberg said. Yet, while the group is large, it is not comprehensive. Apple Inc, which controls the Safari browser on iPhones, and Mozilla Corp, which runs the Firefox browser, are not members of the coalition. Firefox includes a browser setting that blocks ads and Apple began allowing third-party tools that block content on its mobile browser last year. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1675 times.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Alphabet and Apple: 2 of the Best Healthcare Stocks on the Market? Tech giants Alphabet and Apple are hard at work developing solutions to some of healthcare's most vexing problems. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Apr 22, 2017 at 11:41AM Every company is a healthcare company now. At least, that's what it seems like sometimes. Both  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are working on technology to help manage diabetes and address other healthcare issues. Could Alphabet and Apple now be considered two of the best healthcare stocks around? Maybe so. Image source: Getty Images. Teaming up Alphabet has a couple of companies focusing on healthcare -- Calico and Verily. And these companies have forged partnerships with some big established healthcare companies along the way. Calico was formed in 2013 to develop technologies that increase the human lifespan. The following year, AbbVie teamed up with Calico, investing $750 million to try to bring new therapies to market for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer.  In late 2015, Google Life Sciences changed its name to Verily Life Sciences. Verily is working with Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) to develop miniaturized continuous glucose monitors for type 2 diabetic patients. It formed a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline to create bioelectronic medicines that use tiny implanted devices to treat disease. The Alphabet business unit also formed other joint ventures with Johnson & Johnson to develop robotic surgical systems and with Sanofi to create technology that helps diabetic patients better manage their health.  Perhaps the most intriguing project that Verily is working on is its effort with Novartis to develop a smart contact lens that senses glucose level in tears. The goal is to have contact lenses that change color if diabetic patients' glucose levels aren't where they need to be. No pain, big gain CNBC recently reported that Apple has a secret initiative underway that's trying a different approach in monitoring glucose levels. Currently, patients must use finger sticks that pierce their skin four times per day to monitor their glucose levels. Apple's team is trying to develop a solution that uses optical sensors instead. The ultimate goal is to fulfill Apple founder Steve Jobs' vision of wearable devices that could continually monitor important vital signs. Apple Watch already enables monitoring of heart rates. Apple has applied for a patent to send alerts to family or emergency staff if an Apple Watch wearer has heart problems, such as arrhythmia. However, monitoring glucose in a completely non-invasive way has been impossible so far.  Dexcom does have a continuous glucose monitoring system that interfaces with Apple Watch. However, the system uses a sensor that is placed underneath the skin. It also requires a minimum of two finger sticks each day for calibration. Apple's hope appears to be to eliminate the need for finger sticks entirely. Apple is looking at other healthcare opportunities as well. Bloomberg reported last year that the company intends to transform its HealthKit app that runs on iPhones and Apple Watches from a primarily fitness application to a tool that helps improve diagnoses. Apple also bought a small company in early 2016, Gliimpse, which is developing software that stores electronic health records from multiple sources in one place.  Top healthcare picks? There's no question that both Alphabet and Apple are trying to solve some of the most challenging problems in healthcare. But are the stocks good choices for investors wanting to profit from the growth in the healthcare industry? Yes and no. The negative response isn't because Alphabet and Apple aren't solid stock picks. They are. However, in the near term, neither company will generate enough revenue from healthcare to rank the stocks among the best ways to ride the healthcare wave. On the other hand, investors should look at the long run. If Alphabet and Apple are successful in achieving their goals, the financial opportunities in healthcare for both companies are enormous. The diabetes testing market could reach $17 billion by 2021. If Alphabet's smart contact lens pans out and Apple's optical sensor technology works, the two technology giants could also become healthcare giants.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Google Wallet is Making Strides, But it’s No Venmo Killer Last month, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced Gmail users would now be able to send and receive money on Android devices through its Google Wallet platform. The service had been available through Gmail since 2013 but, until last month, was unavailable on mobile devices. To use the service, all that is needed is to compose a new email in the Gmail app on any Android mobile device. Once a new email is opened, users simply choose the „Send money” or „Request money” options under he attachment icon. After a debit card is linked and the amount of money is selected, the funds can then be sent to anyone with an email address or phone number. The recipient does not need to be an existing Google Wallet user or have a Gmail account and is free to all users. The service is currently only available in the United States and United Kingdom. Image source: Pixabay. The feature is the latest attempt by Alphabet to engage its over one billion active Gmail users. The Android operating system, which runs on most smartphones and tablets, had 1.4 billion active users as of September 2015. The overlap between the two is almost certain to be in the hundreds of millions, making this new feature an avenue Alphabet could pursue to deepen its relationships with its huge account holder base. Google Wallet’s uninspiring past While Alphabet has never released official figures on how many active users exist on Google Wallet, it doesn’t take too much digging to discover it is not widely used; a situation almost assuredly of Alphabet’s own making. From the beginning, the platform has struggled from a lack of attention and strategy from its parent company. As a prime example of this neglect, this very feature of using Gmail to send money to other people was first available to desktop users in 2013. Yet it took four additional years for Google to incorporate it into Gmail’s app on mobile devices. Image source: Alphabet Inc’s Google blog . Originally, NFC (near field communication) technology was to be used in conjunction with Google Wallet so that the app could be used to make point-of-sale (POS) purchases. However, this capability was dropped in September 2015. In 2016, Google discontinued the Google Wallet card, a physical debit card linked directly to one’s Google Wallet account. These decisions effectively ended any way customers could use their Google Wallet accounts to make POS transactions at physical retail locations, though there are some work-arounds, such as linking a Google Wallet account to Android Pay, a separate payment app available only to Android users. Google Wallet’s uneven present The constant meddling with Google Wallet’s capabilities has certainly contributed to its lagging popularity. It is now essentially a P2P payment platform left to compete with the likes of PayPal Holdings Inc ‚s(NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo and the newly launched Zelle, a P2P app provided by many of the nation’s largest banks to their customers. Google Wallet will have to overcome many obstacles if it is to capture significant market share. In Accenture’ s 2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments Survey , consumers indicated they trusted traditional card providers, alternative payment providers (e.g. PayPal), and established retail banks as potential mobile payment providers over larger tech companies. And the competition isn’t standing still. In 2016’s fourth quarter, PayPal’s Venmo app, a hit with millennials , facilitated $5.6 billion in payment volume, an eye-popping 126% increase year over year! In December 2016, Venmo crossed the $2 billion total payment volume mark in a single month for the first time in its history. It was just earlier in the year when it first passed the $1 billion threshold in a single month! Zelle is a P2P payment service operated by Early Warning which is owned by some of the country’s largest financial institutions including Bank of America , BB&T , Capital One , JP Morgan Chase , PNC Financial , and Wells Fargo . As with Google Wallet’s new service, these banks’ account holders will be able to send and receive funds using nothing more than a person’s email address or phone number. Many of Zelle’s future users will be able to access the service through their existing mobile banking apps, meaning no additional apps will need to be downloaded onto their smartphones. Google Wallet’s uncertain future Will this latest feature spark renewed interest and user engagement in Google Wallet? While it is impossible to tell, I believe it is highly unlikely, although I certainly see some uses for it. Earlier this spring, I was exchanging emails with my sister about an upcoming summer vacation our families were taking together. She mentioned she would book a large cabin in the mountains and I could pay her back later. It would have been nice to simply respond via email with the accompanying payment attached. While I know it would not have taken much effort to sign up for the service, it still would have taken more effort than using PayPal, a service my sister and I both regularly use. And, while it is possible to send money through Gmail to people who are not yet users of the service or who do not have a Gmail address, I did not want to put my sister through the aggravation of having to link her debit card to the email to retrieve the money. The uphill battle Google Wallet faces is one many platforms are familiar with — once users are comfortable using a certain system, it’s tough to get them to switch. PayPal’s core platform currently has 200 million active accounts and is consistently growing by double-digit percentages each year. As noted above, Venmo is currently growing by triple-digit percentages year over year. Given the gigantic lead these two PayPal platforms enjoy, it’s hard to see Google Wallet closing the gap without a huge marketing push and lots of accompanying attention from its parent company.

The service had been available through Gmail since 2013 but, until last month, was unavailable on mobile devices. To use the service, all that is needed is to compose a new email in the Gmail app on any Android mobile device. Once a new email is opened, users simply choose the „Send money” or „Request money” options under he attachment icon. After a debit card is linked and the amount of money is selected, the funds can then be sent to anyone with an email address or phone number. The recipient does not need to be an existing Google Wallet user or have a Gmail account and is free to all users. The service is currently only available in the United States and United Kingdom. Image source: Pixabay. The feature is the latest attempt by Alphabet to engage its over one billion active Gmail users. The Android operating system, which runs on most smartphones and tablets, had 1.4 billion active users as of September 2015. The overlap between the two is almost certain to be in the hundreds of millions, making this new feature an avenue Alphabet could pursue to deepen its relationships with its huge account holder base.

Samsung Gear VR Controller Completes & Strengthens The Virtual Reality Headset. April 22, 2017 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 11 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Samsung Gear VR Controller has just made the virtual reality headset deal a bit more attractive. However, the addition of a new motion controller will make a 30-dollar hole in pockets, but those who already own the VR headset can get it for just US$39. So now with a standalone controller, Samsung Gear VR is capable of beating Google’s Daydream VR headset on all fronts. Release Date The Korean company Samsung in a partnership with Facebook owned Oculus VR is all set to add a Gear VR Controller in the purchase orders for the new headsets from April 21. The new controller is designed in a way that users can control VR applications, mostly the virtual reality games, with one hand. Samsung has not made any changes to its VR headset as the Gear VR still features the motion sensors and button controls on its side surface. Games According to Oculus VR, 20 games will support the controller at the time of its launch in April. The company also confirmed that around 50 virtual reality games are coming in the next few months and all of them will support the Samsung Gear VR Controller. Design The Gear VR Controller looks similar to the Google’s Daydream controller. When you hold it in a hand, you’ll be controlling the games via a trackpad and a few buttons that include controls for menu and volume. Two volume buttons, 1 trigger key, 1 back button and a menu key below the trackpad can be found on the Gear VR Controller. Battery You will also find a trigger at the end. The similar feature Google also tried to implement in its Daydream Controller but couldn’t do so in the final design. Users can also feel the influence of Oculus VR’s proprietary Touch Controllers in Samsung Gear VR Controller. The wand-like device comes equipped with disposable batteries and doesn’t feature any charging ability. Lack of charging feature can be considered as a drawback if you love Google Daydream controller’s USB-C port that enables users to charge their controller. This move by Samsung can also be considered a clever move because you won’t have to run for a charger if your batteries die. You can simply stock some batteries and replace the dead ones. According to Samsung, if you use a controller for 2 hours a day, the battery will last at least for 40 days. That’s pretty good actually. Specifications Performance wise, Samsung Gear VR Controller looks promising. It gives you some smart sensors that include gyroscope, accelerometer and a magnetic indicator. Beautifully designed wand comes with 3-color LED lights. Virtual Reality Gaming Experience Tapping the headset doesn’t look like a proper solution and even irritates the users to some extent.  With the arrival of a motion controller, the entire setup now looks complete. The controller, however works in the same manner how you use the Google Daydream Controller, but the trigger makes the difference here. It not only adds more natural VR experience, but also makes the setup work as expected. Earlier when everything was just available on the headset, users were somehow missing the hand interactions. Of course, there is a trackpad available on the headset, but tapping it again and again makes players nervous as they do not want to disturb the entire setup by head movements and accidental forceful taps. Bottom Line So far, the Samsung Gear VR Controller is proven to be very responsive, especially during the games when a player is asked to fire or show off weapon skills. Overall, the Gear VR Controller is an ideal choice for those who love experiencing virtual reality without burning their wallets. Those who cannot afford the VR headsets made for PCs or simply don’t want to invest much for VR tech, Samsung’s Gear VR Controller is a perfect choice for immersive virtual reality experience.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Gadgets Get to Know What Google Chromecast Is All About By Donklephant. Published on April 22, 2017. 0 If you love watching movies and television shows, chances are, you have a Netflix or Hulu and would spend time glued on your PC, laptop and mobile device. However, not only do these devices have limited screen sizes, using them continuously for long periods of time can consume too much battery. What you need is a gadget that can solve these concerns and lets you enjoy your favorite chick flicks and shows on your wide screen LED TV. That said, you need to invest in Chromecast. What is Chromecast? Google, Inc is a popular technology company that offers internet-related products and services which include software and hardware. They also launched a device that lets users enjoy video streaming from their high-definition television sets. Compact, convenient and affordable, the first generation Chromecast device was launched in 2013. You just need to connect the dongle, which is powered by USB cable, into an HDMI port and use your smartphone or mobile device as your remote control. With it, you can now access audio and video content from Hulu, YouTube, Google Play Store and Netflix. Moreover, you can use it to stream content from your Chrome browser. Since its first introduction to the market, there were other models or versions launched by Google. These include an audio-only version, another faster new version and the Chromecast Ultra with 4K Ultra HD support. How does Google Chromecast work? Basically, Chromecast becomes a portal for streaming apps downloaded to your mobile phone or device which are to be “cast” onto your HDTV. By selecting the Chromecast icon from the streaming app on your device, the content you want to view is cast to the Chromecast device. As soon as it detects the movie or TV show you want to watch, it streams the content directly from the service and onto your screen. Conversely, your mobile phone serves as the remote control and will not consume too much battery. But if you use Chromecast with your Chrome browser, the device will display what is on your browser. Chromecast Devices Google Chromecast works on smartphones like Android and iPhones as well as tablets, iPads, Chrome for Windows and Mac OS X. There is also an app known as Tube Cast which allows YouTube streaming for Windows Phones but it is limited. The Chromecast iteration that followed the first generation has a puck-like design and is available in three colors: coral, lemonade and black. It also has a malleable HDMI cord, three built-in antennas and supports 5 GHz bands as well as 802.11 ac. Chromecast Ultra, on the other hand, has higher pixels and offers 4K Ultra HD support. These features allow user to view HDR content which have deeper contrast and richer colors. Moreover, this model has Ethernet support and boasts of a faster speed than its predecessor. Chromecast Audio, the other model of this device is used for music streaming via Wi-Fi connection. It casts audio from Pandora, Spotify and Google Play Music and can be remotely controlled via computers, iOS and Android devices. This product from Google is highly recommended if you want to enjoy video and audio streaming from your television without breaking the bank. And with these Google Chromecast tips, you can turn your TV into a personal dashboard and make the most of your viewing experience.

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 80 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares176 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month.

By Marcia Sekhose | Published: April 22, 2017 2:58 PM IST Email @marciasekhose comments Tags: google Google Doodle News Every year, April 22 is celebrated as Earth Day globally, and Google celebrates the day with a special Doodle. Today’s Google Doodle not only commemorates the celebration of Earth Day but also follows with a set of tips on how one can preserve and protect the environment. The Google Doodle has a series of 12 images with the first one set against the backdrop of stars, leaves, and animals. The word ‘Google’ is written with the Earth taking the shape of the letter O. An interesting part is where one can click on the image and drag to get a closer look. The second image is a cute little fox who in its slumber and dreaming about the Earth. The fox first dreams about the ocean and a fish suffering due to climate change and then dreams about penguins suffering due to the melting ice. The fox then wakes up in shock, grabs a shovel, a plant sapling and runs out to the field. Then, the fox is accompanied with his cat friend, and both of them go to the food store to get vegetables. They are then joined by a frog, and all of them then ride a tricycle instead of a public transport. The next set of images shows how the fox and its friends use solar energy for their electrical equipment and how to switch off electrical appliances after usage. The series ends with the fox, the cat and the frog sleeping with the Earth in their mind. Coming to the tips shared by Google, one can simply click on the search icon placed below each image of the series. This opens up a new tab where Google has cute animations giving tips on how to make the Earth a cleaner and safer place to live in. The tips are very simple and easy for everyone to follow, such as turning off the lights, planting a tree in the community, using travel means like carpooling, walking, biking, public transportation to save energy. More tips include eating fruits, veggies, or locally sourced foods to reduce emissions and waste, and a list of things that can be recycled.

The movement protested against the many ways on how the environment was getting deteriorated. This movement was iconic as it gained participation from people from all walks of life, such as politicians, business tycoons, farmers, and activists. This led to the first Earth Day celebrated and by 1990, Earth Day received global participation.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 296 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares513 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Google Drive is cloud storage solution developed by Google. The system is designed to give users access to files, such as documents or images, across a multitude of platforms that can be accessed with a free Google account. Google docs currently includes Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides. There is also an office suite that allows users to collaboratively edit and create a single document in order to maximise productivity. As of 2014 Google Drive has over 240 million active users, and since 2015 the software has over 1 million organisational paying customers. It has also become integral to the Chrome OS which eliminates the need for costly on-board storage. Creating a file on Google Drive is no different to doing it on a computer. Google docs for example, works largely the same way that Microsoft Word, or a similar word processor, would. Simply open the file in your browser, make the changes and additions you want, and then save it. Google Drive automatically saves to the cloud so there is no need for any internal space on your device. Whilst Drive does have a limited space of 15GB, this is more than enough for most people, and this amount can be easily increased via a monthly subscription service. So your file is in the cloud, but because it’s in the cloud you can’t access that file unless you’re connected to the internet. Unfortunately, free WiFi isn’t worldwide yet and that means not having access to your files sometimes. However, it is possible to download files from Google Drive whilst connected, so if you need that important file when access is limited, you can have it pre-prepared on your physical drive and ready to go. But how? Downloading a file from Google Drive is a relatively straightforward process that shouldn’t take users too long to get to grips with. First, you’ll want to go to the Google Drive itself, drive.google.com and login. Then locate the file you wish to download and click on it, if you wish to download multiple files you can hold down shift and control whilst clicking to select them as well. Once you’ve decided which files you want to download, right click on one of the selected files and click download. It’s as easy as that! Your files will appear in your downloads folder, or an alternative location if you’ve configured your system in such a way. Unfortunately you can’t just drag and drop the files from Drive to your device, which would certainly make the process more straightforward. Currently there are a range of different files you can download from Google Drive, these include documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and drawings. All of them in a range of different formats, such as HTML, PNG, JPEG, PDF, DOCX, Open Office, and many more. You should have no trouble with compatibility, no matter where you move your files too. There you have it, a quick and painless way to download files from Google Drive.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > 6 awesome web browsers for iPhone 6 awesome web browsers for iPhone By Brandon Widder — April 22, 2017 6:00 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: If you’re like most of us at Digital Trends, the prospect of surfing the web on a cell phone never seemed tangible until iPhone entered the market in 2007. Sure, we all knew the LG Prada, Windows Mobile phones, and old Blackberries were capable of browsing the web, but none one of them popularized mobile browsers to the degree the iPhone would several years later. Older mobile browsers loaded pages and images at a glacial pace by today’s standards, drastically lagging behind Safari and other popular offerings from key developers like Google, Mobotap, and Opera. What could have been a convenient way to peruse the web on the go was, more often than not, simply more trouble than it was worth. Then came the iPhone. Safari, Apple’s proprietary web browser, sported a streamlined interface, remarkable speed, and a toolset worthy of competing with even the most industrious desktop browsers on the market, but it’s no longer the only available option. Everyone from the aforementioned Google to Ghostery now touts an exclusive mobile app, bringing tabbed and private browsing, cross-platform syncing, and the utmost simplicity to the forefront of mobile web browsing. Now, it’s only a question of personal taste. Here are our top picks for the best web browsers for the iPhone, so you can make the most of the web wherever you have a network connection. Chrome Chrome is Google’s answer to Safari, a heavy-handed counterpart offering a slew of valuable tools and reveling in a deep-seeded integration with the Google ecosystem. Once properly synced, Chrome grants you access to nearly all data associated with your account, including passwords, search history, bookmarks, open tabs and the like. It’s exceptionally quick, offering an address bar that conveniently doubles as a search box while touting the ability to swap between an infinite number of tabs or privately browse the web using the software’s built-in Incognito tab. Chrome even takes a well-executed shot at Apple’s personal assistant with Chrome voice search, allowing you to enter search inquiries with your voice, even when using an older iPhone that doesn’t support Siri. The app’s interface is minimalist and simple, taking a direct cue from its desktop brethren and encasing a slew of functionality inside Chrome’s default, gray exterior. Like any mobile browser, an excess number of tabs can make navigation difficult on a small screen, but browsing is still done in such a way that it never feels burdensome – especially considering the app showcases your top sites whenever you choose to open a new tab. Best for: Those already heavily immersed in the Google ecosystem. Download now for: iOS Ghostery Ghostery is the perfect mobile browser for anyone that doesn’t want advertising companies to know, or see, what they’re doing online. You can even allow the browser to catalog which trackers you encounter and the sites they appear on because the main goal of this browser is to maintain your privacy and anonymity. Cookies can also be completely disabled from the iPhone’s Settings. The browser gives users a list of trackers to enable or disable for whatever site they’re visiting — complete with a red-numbered notification in the bottom-right corner — and there are none of the usual search engine options (i.e. Google, Yahoo, Bing). Instead, there’s ‘Ghostery,’ which is powered by DuckDuckGo. Ghostery isn’t as fast as other mobile browsers on this list, so if you really want to keep your browsing history safe, be prepared to sacrifice a bit of speed for it. The design isn’t particularly pleasing either, though the privacy and anonymity features do set it aside from other browsers. Ghostery also has a feature that lets people protect their Wi-Fi connection from advertisers, which can then be used to block trackers in other apps, provided you’re still using the same internet connection. The feature is in the experimental stage, meaning you might run into some problems while using it, and using it in combination with the Safari browser will likely lead to some performance issues. If you’re really serious about protecting yourself online, though, that may not be a huge issue. Best for: Those who prefer privacy over speed and design. Download now for: iOS Opera Mini Web Browser Opera Mini began as a simple pilot project in 2004, derived from the king of open-source desktop browsers and built from the ground up to fetch all web content through a proxy server. Being the case, the mobile browser is one of the fastest — if not the fastest — pieces of software on our roundup, quickly compressing data by up to 90 percent before downloading and displaying webpages and similar content on even the most crowded of networks. It’s lightweight and designed to run on limited bandwidth, so it doesn’t offer the myriad of standard features that rivals bake in. Although options are limited, bookmarks and top sites can still be synced between the mobile and desktop versions of the software, and various multimedia content can be saved by simply tapping and holding said image, link, text or another content type on the screen. The equipped interface, dark and adorned with larger icons than are typically present in mobile browsers, is also a nice touch, allowing you to easily navigate between tabbed webpages and the dashboard tray at a moment’s notice. If desired, you can view webpages in a welcoming full-screen mode or take a glance at various data usage statistics highlighting the amount of data used in the current session or during the entirety of the app’s lifespan on your phone. And then there’s the informative Help menu outlining each component of the app. Best for: Those who seek speed and an easy-to-navigate interface. Download now for: iOS Dolphin Browser Mobotap’s mobile browser could be the most remarkable browser on our list based on the name alone, but it doesn’t stop there. Though it sports a somewhat high learning curve, it’s an incredibly stable browser, one coupled with a girth of valuable features and intrinsically rooted in social networking like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Once synced with the appropriate accounts, you can share content across social networks with a single click, or save the content directly to their Evernote or Box account. Additional options for altering the homepage’s background image, adjusting the font size, and initiating full-screen mode are also present, as is the opportunity to privately browse the web and block unwanted ads and various pop-up content. Despite the mobile browser’s stark contrasts with Safari, it’s just as fast in terms of speed and boasts syncing capabilities for saving your history, passwords, bookmarks, and other data across mobile and desktop accounts. Although more of a novelty than a crucial function, Dolphin incorporates a Pictionary-esque gesture navigation, encouraging you to draw a swath of recognizable symbols that will, in turn, initiate various actions. For instance, scribbling the letter “N’ on the dedicated input screen will automatically open a new tab, while drawing the letter “T” will direct the current tab to the main Twitter homepage. It’s not the most useful action, but it is inventive and surprisingly accurate. Dolphin also supports voice search thanks to its Dolphin Sonar feature, but users will have to pay $0.99 first before they can use it. Best for: Those who desire greater customization and novelty navigation. Download now for: iOS Firefox Before Chrome took over our desktops, Mozilla Firefox was the go-to web browser if you wanted something more powerful than Internet Explorer. Firefox for iOS has all the features that other similar web browsers have, such as sign-in to sync settings, history, bookmarks, and passwords. Firefox’s private browsing mode prevents the browser from remembering your browsing history, and it will also allow you to delete any and all saved information with one tap. If you dig a little deeper into the settings, you will see why you may prefer Firefox to other mobile browsers. For example, Firefox will let you choose whether or not you want to allow it to work with a third-party keyboard. Some third-party keyboards can transmit things that you type back to the developer, so it is good to have an option for this setting. Another very important privacy-related setting is the integration of Touch ID & Passcodes. An example of when this might be useful is if someone else has access to your smartphone. In Chrome, for instance, someone can borrow your smartphone and access the saved passwords section by going to the settings. In Firefox, you can turn on Touch ID & Passcodes, and when you want access to saved log-ins, Firefox will ask you for a passcode or fingerprint. We believe all mobile browsers should have this feature. Best for: Those who share their smartphone with others. Download now for: iOS Safari It’s also the fastest web browser on our list thanks to its exclusive JavaScript engine while remaining feature-laden enough to compete with the best. Moreover, Safari offers voice search capabilities similar to Chrome, but being the software is an Apple product, it relies on voice assistance through Siri. The coupled iCloud Keychain is also a standout, saving and automatically inputting account names, passwords, and credit card numbers whenever you need to sign into a site or shop online, as is the ability to save images to the photo album by pressing said content for several seconds. Other features abound, but it’s the built-in convenience and Safari’s innate ease of use making it one of our top five picks. Best for: Those seeking merely the bare minimum.

CNET Lynn La 16 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL John Cleese calls Trump supporters 'the stupidest people' Four new holidays if Corbyn wins © Provided by CNET Josh Miller For whatever reason, maybe Samsung's new Galaxy S8 isn't doing it for you. Luckily, there are other great large-screen Androids to consider, like LG's beautifully designed G6 and Google's impressive Pixel XL. They're both great devices, but the G6 and Pixel XL have different strengths. To help decide which one is right for you, I evaluated how they compared in design, camera, performance, features and value. Read on to find out more... Design: Eye candy and durability Love it or hate it, the Pixel's glass shade on top of a metal back makes it stand out from other phones. Personally, I love it. The problem is that glass can crack, as it did with our unit. Also, despite it housing a smaller screen, the Pixel XL is physically larger than the G6, and it's been pointed out that the Pixel looks too similar to the iPhone. That said, the Really Blue color on the Pixels is particularly eye-catching, and the chamfered edges make it easier to grasp than the G6. The G6's smooth edges mean it can easily slip from your hands. The glass is a problem here too: Our unit somehow got a hairline fracture on the front, despite us never actually dropping it (maybe it rubbed against a set of keys or something). But as LG phones go, this is the best-looking one yet. Though I'd struggle to pick it out of a lineup, it looks polished and elegant. And the G6's ace in the hole is its water resistance. This durability against accidental dunks and splashes is a big benefit. Winner: If it were purely aesthetics, I'd give it to the Pixel. But water resistance gives the G6 the ultimate leg up. Camera: Capturing beautiful pics and video The G6 has two 13-megapixel cameras on the back, one of which includes a wide-angle lens. That means you can get more content in each frame (great for vast, scenic shots). The 5-megapixel front-facing camera has an option for that too, so you won't have to struggle too much to fit more peeps in a group selfie. There's also a Square Camera app that edits neat square photos perfect for Instagram. Aside from a Lens Blur mode, the Pixel doesn't have many camera tricks, packing only a simple 12.3-megapixel camera and an 8-megapixel camera. But it doesn't need to, considering it's a fantastic camera in and of itself. While both the Pixel and G6 take vibrant and clear photos in bright, well-lit settings, and both have image stabilization features for video, the Pixel has a superior camera. It excels at low-light photography, takes sharper selfies and records steadier video (albeit with a floaty, drone-like quality). Winner: While the G6's wide-angle feature has its uses, I'd take the Pixel's low-light prowess over that, any day. Performance: Processor speeds and battery life Both phones are equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset from 2016. As such, their benchmark scores for Antutu, Geekbench and 3DMark were pretty neck-and-neck (you can check out the hard numbers here). And if you think processing speeds are similar on paper, real life usage (opening up apps, launching the camera, scrolling and typing, etc.) is just as hard to discern since both handsets are fast and speedy. (As a reminder though, the Pixels came out last year compared to the G6, which launched this month. Their successors, which are expected sometime this fall, will likely have the Snapdragon 835 chipset, or another advanced processor that should be faster and more efficient.) The G6 has a 3,300mAh battery while the Pixel XL has a slightly higher 3,450mAh. During our battery tests for continuous video playback on Airplane mode, the G6 clocked in 13 hours and 21 minutes while the Pixel lasted 28 minutes longer at 13 hours and 49 minutes. Winner: The Pixel XL, but only barely because its battery time is slightly longer. It's not by much, but it don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning's winning. Features: Interface and software goodies With both handsets running Android 7.0 Nougat and the digital search assistant Google Assistant built right in (which is also available for other Android phones), there's not much differentiating the G6 and Pixel in terms of software. I do, however, like the Pixel's interface slightly better than LG's custom software, called UX 6.0. I prefer the way Google designed details like the icons, dialer and menus. Still, any grievances about the G6's look and feel aren't anything a third-party launcher and icon pack can't resolve. One thing to remember, though, is that the Pixel is on tap to receive major software updates as soon as Google's ready to roll them out. If you purchase the G6 from a carrier, that can also add more delays to updates. Winner: Both -- and by both I mean neither, since they have rather unexciting software features outside Nougat and Assistant, which they both provide. Value: Most bang for your buck  While both the G6 and Pixel are high-end, premium phones, LG's phone is consistently less expensive, even when you factor in different countries and carriers. In the US, the priciest G6 is on AT&T, and that still comes in about $50 cheaper than the Pixel (32 GB). In the UK there's about a £70 difference and you can save about AU$260 with the G6 in Australia. The Pixel's price gets even steeper if you spring for the 128 GB version, whereas the G6 has expandable memory and you can increase its storage up to 2 TB via a microSD card. Of course, prices fluctuate throughout the year, and retailers can list different prices and sales than the one listed above. In addition, retailers may offer different promotions and bundles, like the G6's buy-one-get-a-Google Home-free special that recently passed (some carriers even included an LG TV). Be sure to look into any offers that may be available at your time of purchase. Winner: Barring any crazy Pixel deal or bundle I'm not aware of, the G6 is the better value. And the winner is...  Tallying up the scores, the LG G6 and Google Pixel XL tie. The G6 wins with design (again, water resistance was its saving grace) and value. But the Pixel comes up in camera and performance. If money were no object and I had to consider both devices in a vacuum, the Pixel's edge in these two categories objectively make it the better phone. But the G6's lower price (not to mention water resistance) give it a big boost. Ultimately, a lot of what makes a phone "better" than the other depends on you, the buyer. Deciding on the G6 or the Pixel hinges on your budget and your priorities. Maybe you'd rather take better photos than have a waterproof phone. Or maybe saving extra dough leaves you with enough to purchase something else you're eyeing. LG and Google did a great job with both handsets, and the G6 and Pixel are top-notch. Whichever way you go, you'll be satisfied. The thing is to know which features are most important to you.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Still I agree WhatsApp has worked wonders for years. They pretty much release an update a day too on their beta Play Store listing. TechGuy22 kill whatsapp? are you drunk?

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

By creating a Google account, you get to enjoy services which include Gmail. How to Get Gmail in Your Android Device For Android users with newer OS versions, Gmail is pre-installed on the device. If you already have a Google account, you can access Gmail from your smartphone or tablet. Simply sign in to your account and you can readily send and receive emails. However, if you need to install Gmail or re-install it on your Android device, you can do so via the Google Play Store. Launch Play Store and type “Gmail” on the search bar.

You can now sign-in to your account and enjoy the features of this app. How to Use Gmail on Your PC So long as you have internet connection, you can access Gmail from your web browser. You can go to accounts.google.com and create your account. If you already have an account, you can simply go to google.com.  At the top right hand corner, you will see the Google apps menu. Click on it and you will see the Gmail icon. Click on the icon to launch your Google account and access your mails. Signing-in to Gmail To access your Gmail account, you can login from any computer with internet connection or add your account to the Gmail app on your tablet or smartphone. After signing in, you can now check your Inbox to read your emails. Signing in and adding a Gmail account on your Android or iPhone can be done in few easy steps.

The announcements coincides with the global retail launch of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, Samsung’s latest flagship smartphones. The deal also benefits Samsung users as they’ll be able to upload 100,000 of their own songs to Google Play Music for free, double the limit for owners of non-Samsung devices. Additionally, new Samsung phones and tablets will come with a free three-month trial of Google Play Music. Post the trial period, those who plan to subscribe for it will get over 40 million songs on-demand and access to YouTube Red (where available), just like other subscribers of the service. Google in November launched a revamped Play Music service that is powered by Google's machine learning and contextual tools. Machine learning allows the service to understand the music the user likes based on location, time, weather, and activity, to name a few. Google’s Play Music service competes against the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora Premium, and others. The tie up with Samsung, one of the leading smartphone manufactures in the world, will help Google expand its reach and give it the right amount of boost it needs to take on other streaming giants. Having Google Play Music as a default music player means Samsung will not have to worry about dedicating resources towards developing its own music player, though it’s still available to download from Google Play Store. Samsung has tried in the past to get into the music streaming game with Milk Music, but its attempt at competing against Spotify and Apple failed, and the company in August decided to kill off the service. Interestingly, Google’s Play Music service will support Samsung’s own personal assistant software, Bixby. Users will be able to ask Bixby to look up a song and play it similar to how it works with Apple’s Siri. The Bixby support will kick in once the digital assistant comes out later this spring for Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Samsung’s latest flagship Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will go on sale in India from May 5.

Fortune Insiders Search Search russia hackRussian Gets Longest U.S. Hacking Sentence Ever TheranosPlaintiff: Theranos Used Shell Companies to Buy Outside Testing Equipment FoodAnthony Bourdain Says the Unicorn Frappucino Is ‘the Perfect Nexus of Awfulness’ White HousePresident Trump Defends Environmental Record on Earth Day Commentary privacy rights Watching Burger King’s Newest Ad Puts Your Privacy in Jeopardy Michael Price Apr 22, 2017 Earlier this month, Burger King aired a 15-second commercial whose intended audience—Google Home devices, web-connected virtual assistants that respond to spoken questions and commands—couldn’t eat a hamburger if they wanted to. The ad ended with a spokesperson using the wake phrase “Okay Google,” followed by an odd-sounding question: “What is the Whopper burger?” This in effect hijacked Google Home devices, causing the machines to read aloud from the Whopper’s Wikipedia page, which Burger King had recently replaced with ad copy. Some saw the spot as a clever publicity stunt, while others made unkind edits to the Wikipedia entry that Google Home users would hear (Whopper ingredients may include “rat and toenail clippings” and a “medium-sized child”). Google quickly blocked the commercial from activating its devices, but Burger King got around the fix by airing slightly different versions of the ad later the same evening, to the same effect. This is not the first time a company has triggered voice-activated devices with an ad—Google did it during its Super Bowl commercial for Google Home, seemingly by accident. But the Whopper incident appears to be the first time a major company has done so intentionally, shamelessly, and with such disregard for privacy. There is no nice way to put this: Burger King hacked Google Home. There is a good reason why Google uses a wake phrase; it is a way for users to control when their devices are actively listening. Only with the magic words do they begin recording speech and transmitting data to Google for a response. While by no means perfect, this is a critical privacy feature, given that the product is basically a big Internet-enabled microphone placed in otherwise private spaces. Related Career AdviceThis ‘Easy’ Question Is One of the Hardest to Answer in a Job Interview Career Advice This ‘Easy’ Question Is One of the Hardest to Answer in a Job Interview What Burger King did was turn Google’s privacy feature into a bug. Hopefully, Google Home owners were not having any intimate conversations when the ad aired during late-night TV. But if they were, Google probably now has a transcript of them. What’s more, that information could be obtained by police without a warrant, thanks to an outdated legal doctrine denying Fourth Amendment privacy protections to data shared with “third parties,” like Google. At the risk of sounding too much like a dad, this really isn’t funny. It was funny when Amazon’s Echo device started ordering dollhouses and sugar cookies, courtesy of a six-year-old’s requests. Burger King, by contrast, ran a commercial that was specifically scripted to take control of users’ devices, cause them to record private conversations, and play audio without user consent. When Google tried to fix the problem, Burger King defiantly devised a workaround to invade American living rooms and bedrooms once again. It was malware disguised as TV ads. One tech solution to this problem may be a voice recognition feature that permits only authorized users to trigger the device. But the voice prints required to do so would raise privacy issues of their own because they would give companies yet another unique way to identify individuals. Indeed, federal and state laws recognize voice prints as private biometric data requiring controls. A better solution would be for companies to refrain from making malicious ads and conducting what the New York Times called “corporate warfare in the living room.” But if companies persist with this practice and this ad is a harbinger of things to come, then it may be time for lawmakers to step in. The prospect of a federal policy fix seems dim given the recent repeal of Obama-era Internet privacy rules, but state and local governments may still be able to take action. For example, in response to concerns that Samsung Smart TVs were spying on people in their living rooms, California introduced legislation to fix the problem and protect consumer privacy. Until practices or policies change, however, consumers would be wise to educate themselves about the privacy and security risks associated with “always on” devices in the home, from Google Homes and Amazon Echoes to smart televisions. Burger King’s hack is an important wake-up call about how vulnerable our personal devices have become.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Google Wallet is Making Strides, But it's No Venmo Killer Android users can now send money through Gmail on their favorite mobile device. Does it matter? Matthew Cochrane (CMFCochrane) Apr 22, 2017 at 8:48AM Last month, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced Gmail users would now be able to send and receive money on Android devices through its Google Wallet platform. The service had been available through Gmail since 2013 but, until last month, was unavailable on mobile devices. To use the service, all that is needed is to compose a new email in the Gmail app on any Android mobile device. Once a new email is opened, users simply choose the "Send money" or "Request money" options under he attachment icon. After a debit card is linked and the amount of money is selected, the funds can then be sent to anyone with an email address or phone number. The recipient does not need to be an existing Google Wallet user or have a Gmail account and is free to all users. The service is currently only available in the United States and United Kingdom. Image source: Pixabay. The feature is the latest attempt by Alphabet to engage its over one billion active Gmail users. The Android operating system, which runs on most smartphones and tablets, had 1.4 billion active users as of September 2015. The overlap between the two is almost certain to be in the hundreds of millions, making this new feature an avenue Alphabet could pursue to deepen its relationships with its huge account holder base. Google Wallet's uninspiring past While Alphabet has never released official figures on how many active users exist on Google Wallet, it doesn't take too much digging to discover it is not widely used; a situation almost assuredly of Alphabet's own making. From the beginning, the platform has struggled from a lack of attention and strategy from its parent company. As a prime example of this neglect, this very feature of using Gmail to send money to other people was first available to desktop users in 2013. Yet it took four additional years for Google to incorporate it into Gmail's app on mobile devices. Image source: Alphabet Inc's Google blog. Originally, NFC (near field communication) technology was to be used in conjunction with Google Wallet so that the app could be used to make point-of-sale (POS) purchases. However, this capability was dropped in September 2015. In 2016, Google discontinued the Google Wallet card, a physical debit card linked directly to one's Google Wallet account. These decisions effectively ended any way customers could use their Google Wallet accounts to make POS transactions at physical retail locations, though there are some work-arounds, such as linking a Google Wallet account to Android Pay, a separate payment app available only to Android users. Google Wallet's uneven present The constant meddling with Google Wallet's capabilities has certainly contributed to its lagging popularity. It is now essentially a P2P payment platform left to compete with the likes of PayPal Holdings Inc's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo and the newly launched Zelle, a P2P app provided by many of the nation's largest banks to their customers. Google Wallet will have to overcome many obstacles if it is to capture significant market share. In Accenture's 2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments Survey, consumers indicated they trusted traditional card providers, alternative payment providers (e.g. PayPal), and established retail banks as potential mobile payment providers over larger tech companies. And the competition isn't standing still. In 2016's fourth quarter, PayPal's Venmo app, a hit with millennials, facilitated $5.6 billion in payment volume, an eye-popping 126% increase year over year! In December 2016, Venmo crossed the $2 billion total payment volume mark in a single month for the first time in its history. It was just earlier in the year when it first passed the $1 billion threshold in a single month! Zelle is a P2P payment service operated by Early Warning which is owned by some of the country's largest financial institutions including Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One, JP Morgan Chase, PNC Financial, and Wells Fargo. As with Google Wallet's new service, these banks' account holders will be able to send and receive funds using nothing more than a person's email address or phone number. Many of Zelle's future users will be able to access the service through their existing mobile banking apps, meaning no additional apps will need to be downloaded onto their smartphones. Google Wallet's uncertain future Will this latest feature spark renewed interest and user engagement in Google Wallet? While it is impossible to tell, I believe it is highly unlikely, although I certainly see some uses for it. Earlier this spring, I was exchanging emails with my sister about an upcoming summer vacation our families were taking together. She mentioned she would book a large cabin in the mountains and I could pay her back later. It would have been nice to simply respond via email with the accompanying payment attached. While I know it would not have taken much effort to sign up for the service, it still would have taken more effort than using PayPal, a service my sister and I both regularly use. And, while it is possible to send money through Gmail to people who are not yet users of the service or who do not have a Gmail address, I did not want to put my sister through the aggravation of having to link her debit card to the email to retrieve the money. The uphill battle Google Wallet faces is one many platforms are familiar with -- once users are comfortable using a certain system, it's tough to get them to switch. PayPal's core platform currently has 200 million active accounts and is consistently growing by double-digit percentages each year. As noted above, Venmo is currently growing by triple-digit percentages year over year. Given the gigantic lead these two PayPal platforms enjoy, it's hard to see Google Wallet closing the gap without a huge marketing push and lots of accompanying attention from its parent company. With Alphabet's track record with Google Wallet, that's not something to count on.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Published on April 22, 2017. 0 Google has released its Pixel smartphone in October 2016, while Samsung has brought its Galaxy A5 2017 in January 2017. Today we will compare these two handsets and you will decide which one suits your needs better. Designs The Google Pixel measures 143.8×69.5×8.5mm and weights 143 grams. Its back is partially glossy, because Google wanted to avoid antenna lines, and the three color options have weird names: Quite Black, Very Silver, AND Really Blue. On the other hand, the Galaxy A5 2017 is slimmer, but heavier, as it measures 146.1×71.4×7.9mm and weights 157 grams. Samsung opted for a glass and metal construction and the available colors are Black Sky, Gold Sand, Blue Mist, and Peach Cloud. Displays The Google Pixel comes with an AMOLED display of 5-inch that supports a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels at 441 ppi. The Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 has a bigger super AMOLED display of 5.2-inch that supports a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels at 424 ppi. Both displays are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4. Processors, Graphics Cards & RAM Google Pixel features a Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 821 chipset, a dual-core Kryo CPU clocked at 1.6GHz and a dual-core Kryo CPU clocked at 2.15GHz, an Adreno 530 graphics card and 4GB of RAM. The Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 comes with an Exynos 7880 chipset, an octa-core Cortex A53 CPU clocked at 1.9GHz, a Mali-T830MP3 graphics card and 3GB of RAM. Storages The Google Pixel has been released in two internal storage variants of 32GB and 128GB, without the possibility to expand it. Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 is available only with an internal storage of 32GB, but you are able to expand it up to 256GB using a microSD card. Cameras The Google Pixel sports a primary camera of 12.3MP that features dual-LED flash, face detection, HDR, panorama, geo-tagging and a secondary camera of 8MP. The Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 has a primary camera of 16MP that features LED flash, autofocus, geo-tagging, panorama, face detection, touch focus and a secondary camera of 16MP. Batteries The Google Pixel is powered by a non-removable battery of 2770 mAh, which is weaker than the non-removable battery of 3000 mAh that the Samsung Galaxy A5 2017 features.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Apps What You Need to Know About Google Play Store Download for Android By Donklephant. Published on April 22, 2017. 0 For the millions of app users who own Android devices, Google Play Store is the most important app there is. This is because it serves as an online store for Android owners who are looking to download mobile apps, digital content, music and ebooks on their mobile devices running Android OS. Since it was introduced in the market years ago, Play Store has undergone several updates, with the latest being the APK version 7.7.17.0. It is also the official app store for the Android operating system and comes pre-installed with supported Android devices. The apps available for download can be installed on Android devices for free while some are also available for a cost. Marketed as one brand, the services under Google Play include Google Play Games, Google Play Books, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Newsstand and Google Play Music. With around 2,300 apps available in 2009, the number of downloadable applications available in Google Play Store has ballooned to 2.7 million in February, with around 50 billion downloads made as of last year. Although Google Play Store does not come without challenges, such as the recent Trojan malware discovered in two of the apps available from the Play Store, its popularity still continuous to soar. Apart from Google addressing the issue by removing the apps in question, the latest update also came with new fixes. Some of the changes that came with the latest APK version include security warnings for the app. If a third party tries to update an app, Play Store blocks the action and notifies the user. Moreover, only two widgets will remain in the latest version. These are “Play – My Library” and “Play Recommendations”. How to Download Google Play APK Version In case you have to re-install Google Play Store in your Android device, you first have to enable a certain feature on your phone. You can do this by going to Settings and then Security. Next, tick the box next to Unknown sources. After enabling Unknown sources, you can now go to one of the mirror websites to download Google Play APK version. Simply follow the instructions to have the app in your Android device. If you are still using an older version, you can now download the latest Google Play Store version 7.7.17.0 to enjoy its features.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Apps Google Maps and Its New Features By Donklephant. Published on April 22, 2017. 0 The evolution of internet and technology has indeed made life easier for most of us. Today, getting directions, finding locations of businesses and viewing maps are possible even if you are on the road, with the use of Google Maps. Developed by two brothers and bought by Google, Inc, Google Maps was launched in 2005. It is a web mapping service that offers 360° panoramic views of streets, street maps, satellite imagery and directions from one point to another by foot, bus, bicycle and by car. It was designed using C++ as a desktop program and after its acquisition by Google, the program was converted into a web application. With Google Maps, it is possible to do navigation and get to your destination the fastest way possible since the app provides real-time traffic information. It also comes with a voice navigation feature to keep you up-to-date with traffic, know which lane to choose and where to turn, although this feature does not apply in all languages and regions. How to Use the Navigation Features First, open the Google Map’s app and search for a place or select it from the map. At the bottom right, select “Directions”. It is possible to type specific locations to add other destinations as well as “stops” which can be up to nine stops. Next, choose from the different modes of traveling. It can be by walking, driving, taking public transportation and cycling. Other available routes are also displayed in gray on the map. You can use a different route by choosing the gray line. And to start navigation, simply choose “Navigate” and to cancel navigation, you can tap “Exit” at the bottom right of the screen. Google Maps New Features For iPhone owners, there are new exciting features for the app. These include an iMessage app, Timeline and a widget for a new screen lock. With the update, turn-by-turn directions are available as a widget. Conversely, the iMessage app makes it easier to let your contacts know where you are currently located. With the Timeline feature now available for iPhones, viewing the places you have been to and even adding more details on the locations has never been easier. By simply going to Settings, you can already access and view your travel history. Moreover, you can also set it to have an email sent to you each month to inform you of the places you have been to in the last 30 days. While this feature can be useful, not all users are fond of having their every move monitored. Luckily, it is possible to disable this feature and keep your privacy. Simply go to Settings > Personal Content > Location History. Next, toggle off the switch. And if you want to only disable this feature temporarily, just go to Your Timeline > Settings > Pause Location History. Other options are also available. Find out more by going to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Google Maps and choose “While Using the App”. Read more about the top Google Maps’ tips and make the most of this interesting app. Categories Apps Tags GoogleGoogle Maps 0 likes Popular Posts Games Clash of Clans April Update Rumored to Bring Exclusive Items and Spells Tech iPad Pro 2 to Replace the MacBook Air?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Guest The 5 biggest tech stories out of India this week Pankaj Mishra, FactorDaily@factordaily April 22, 2017 6:00 AM Image Credit: xtock/Shutterstock It’s been another action-packed week for India’s tech and startup scene. Here are the highlights:1. Google launched Areo, a hyper local app for food delivery and services. In a really strange move, Google has kind of entered the food delivery services market in India, which has seen quite a bloodbath over the past year with the likes of FoodPanda shutting down operations. 2. Snapchat responded to heckling; said it’s “grateful for Indian Snapchat community.” India’s social media scene was on fire this week, thanks to Snapchat. Variety quoted ex Snapchat employee Anthony Pompliano as saying that CEO Evan Spiegel told him (in September 2015) that “the app is only for rich people. I don’t want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.” 3. Amazon launched fire stick. To push more consumers to stream content using less bandwidth, Amazon on Wednesday launched Fire TV stick with voice remote in India. 4.  Prominent Indian VC accused of sexual misconduct. Allegations of inappropriate verbal and physical conduct against Mahesh Murthy, a prominent venture and angel investor in India, continued with two more women talking openly about instances of sexual advances he allegedly made 13-14 years ago that may be considered predatory behavior. 5. Whatsapp admins will be held liable for rumors or fake news circulated on the app. India’s cops have issued a new order to tackle fake news and get a better grip on over 200 million WhatsApp users in the country. And here’s this week’s bonus link: a profile story about a SaaS founder in India, Girish Mathrubootham, who applied lessons from his troubled childhood to build Freshdesk, which rivals Zendesk. Pankaj Mishra is editor-in-chief and cofounder of Indian tech blog FactorDaily. He has been a covering technology since 2000 for several publications, including The Economic Times, Mint, and TechCrunch.

What is it, how do we celebrate it and when did the new Google Earth launch? Google unveiled a new version of Google Earth during a special Earth Day event By Jennifer Newton 22nd April 2017, 2:08 pm Updated: 22nd April 2017, 2:09 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments IT’S the planet we live on and is home to more than six billion humans and countless other animals and plants. But with climate change and pollution endangering planet Earth, people are being implored to help protect the fragile environment. Alamy 3 Every year on April 22, people across the globe celebrate Earth Day This means that each year people come together to mark Earth Day and raise awareness of being green. Here’s all you need to know about the occasion… When is Earth Day 2017? Earth Day is held every year on April 22 and in 2017 this is no different – happy Earth Day! Organisers settled on this date as it is in the spring but does not conflict with the religious holidays of Easter and Passover. It is also said that one of the organisers, Julian Koenig came up with the idea of holding it on April 22 as it was his birthday and the word ‘birthday’ rhymes with Earth Day. What is Earth Day? Earth Day is an annual event marked across the world to show support for environmental protection. The aim is to encourage people to do things that will benefit the Earth, such as recycling more, using solar power or plant trees. The event takes place around the world and it is described as the biggest secular holiday on the planet. More than a billion people are expected to celebrate the day including environmental campaigners Leonardo di Caprio and Emma Watson. Getty Images 3 Earth Day is an annual event to raise awareness of protecting the environment When did he new Google Earth launch? Plans for a new version of Google Earth were released on Tuesday April 18 during an Earth Day event. The search engine mailed out invitations for an Earth Day event, which is being held at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York City. Google Earth is virtual globe which allows users to explore the planet using satellite images. And finally, the service has had a serious revamp and users are now able to enjoy the new system. Exciting features, including interactive stories from around the world using Voyager, have been rolled out. Voyager includes guides from experts such as NASA and BBC Earth. Users are able to get suggestions for new points of interest and use “Knowledge Cards” to get information about places on the app. There is also be the option to explore the world at random using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” option or even orbit the world using the new 3D features. Mobile users will be able to capture and send postcards from locations searched for on the app. Getty Images 3 People can mark Earth Day be doing simple things such as planting trees or recycling more How did Earth Day begin? Earth Day began after a devastating oil spill more almost 50 years ago prompted a group of peace activists to raise environmental awareness. At a UNESCO conference in San Francisco in 1969, peace activist John McConnell proposed that a day should be set aside to honour the Earth and the environment. He believed that humans had an obligation to protect the earth and share its resources with future generations. The first Earth Day took place the following year in 1970 and marking it were 2,000 colleges and 10,000 schools across the US. Now it is celebrated in 192 countries across the world by around one billion people. How can you celebrate Earth Day? There are events taking place across the globe on Earth Day and it is likely one will be taking place in your local area. For more information you can visit the Earth Day website www.earthday.org. Here you can also download a toolkit so you can organise Earth Day events in your community.

Chrome 58 improves Custom Tabs and Progressive Web Apps, breaks sites using certain HTTPS certificates, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 7:05am PDTApr 21, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares158 Applications Downloads Google News Article Contents 1 Improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs 2 Distrusting all WoSign and StartCom certificates 3 Removal of old New Tab Page UI 4 Changes to Progressive Web Apps 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 58 was just released on the desktop a few days ago, and in speedier fashion than usual, Chrome 58 for Android is now available. This update focuses on improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs and Progressive Web Apps, includes dozens of minor improvements, and blocks HTTPS/SSL certificates from certain certificate providers. Improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs Google has been working on Chrome Custom Tabs quite a lot recently. In the last update, Custom Tabs gained almost all the functionality of normal Chrome tabs, such as finding text in the page and adding sites to the home screen. However, links in Custom Tabs were still pretty limited. Holding down on a link would only reveal options to copy the link or download it. Thankfully, Chrome 58 addresses this by adding more functions, such as the ability to open the link in a new Chrome tab.   Left: Chrome 57; Right: Chrome 58 With this change, there really isn't any differences (as far as functionality goes) between normal Chrome tabs and Custom Tabs. Distrusting all WoSign and StartCom certificates When you see the green lock icon and the word 'Secure,' that means that the site you're viewing has a valid SSL certificate. These certificates are provided by Certificate Authorities, which have the responsibility of verifying ownership of a given site before issuing a certificate for it. Before you scroll down to the next section because this sounds boring, stay with me, because this is where the craziness begins. Back in October, Google called out WoSign for issuing a certificate for one of GitHub's domains - without GitHub's authorization. In layman's terms, WoSign gave away a key to GitHub's house without asking GitHub's permission. As you can imagine, that didn't go over too well. Google conducted an investigation into WoSign's business practices, and found that the company had "knowingly and intentionally misissued certificates in order to circumvent browser restrictions and CA requirements." In addition, StartCom (which was previously bought by WoSign) had basically been completely absorbed into WoSign - despite StartCom repeatedly saying otherwise. An example of an SSL certificate error. Due to the damage that WoSign and StartCom's certificates could do, Google started distrusting all of their certificates issues after October 21, 2016 with Chome 56 (and Mozilla did something similar). However, starting with Chrome 58, Chrome will not trust any WoSign and StartCom certificates at all. So if you see security warnings on sites you visit with Chrome 58, they may have been using certificates from those two companies. Removal of old New Tab Page UI You may recall that back in Chrome 54, Google changed the New Tab Page to add suggested articles. The new design removed the Bookmarks and Recent Tabs buttons, which annoyed some users. Thankfully, you could go back to the old design fairly easily. However, one the the flags required to disable the new design (#enable-ntp-snippets) has been removed in Chrome 58. We first spotted this in the Chrome 58 Beta, so this isn't unexpected, but still unfortunate. You can still remove the suggestions by disabling #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions, but the Bookmarks and Recent tabs buttons do not come back. Changes to Progressive Web Apps If you're not aware, Progressive Web Apps are web applications that behave like native apps. They can push notifications, share content to other Android apps (and receive shared content), and even have their own icons in the app drawer. Further blurring the line between native and web apps, Chrome 58 gives PWAs the ability to go full-screen. By adding "display: fullscreen" to the web app's manifest, PWAs opened from the home screen/app drawer will hide the status bar and (if applicable) software navigation bar. In addition, Progressive Web Apps launched from the home screen/app drawer now have the ability to autoplay video unmuted. On normal sites, Chrome on Android automatically mutes any auto-playing video. Other features As with every Chrome release, there are several smaller features that are worth briefly mentioning. Here are a few of them. Web sites can now customize Chrome's native media controls with the new ControlsList API. If you're using an Android device with a mouse, clicking inside web pages will register MouseEvents in the page instead of TouchEvents. Basically, web sites will know you're using a mouse instead of a touch screen. Sites can now use the CSS color-gamut media query to detect the approximate range of colors supported by Chrome and the device it's running on. Chrome 58 supports trailing commas in Javascript, for parameter and argument lists. Non-HTTPS sites can no longer display notifications with the Notifications API. Navigating to data: URLs in tabs (doesn't apply to content embedded in the page) is no longer supported. I'm actually incredibly glad Google has done this, because it has been recently used in many phishing scams - like this one. Chrome 58 supports IndexDB 2.0. You can read more about the improvements here. The Autofill page in Chrome settings has been renamed to 'Autofill and Payments.' APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

I especially hope they don't decide to remove the feature later because I've gotten so used to it already. Borgman Have you had any problems with bottom omnibox in chrome beta? Specifically when opening an incognito tab? (I tried twice and turned it off because incognito didn't work for some reason, roughly 2-3 weeks ago). I'd open a tab with incognito, type in the box to search something, hit search, but then it opened/searched in the regular non-incognito tab. Corbin Davenport I've been using Chrome Dev for a few weeks now with the bottom omnibox, incognito tabs seem to work fine. Borgman Is Dev fairly stable compared to beta?! I've thought about downloading it, but was rather nervous! Corbin Davenport It's been pretty stable for me, actually. Borgman That's good to hear! I might give it a try then! Nate I'm on the beta and can't find a setting or flag for this. How did you do that? Corbin Davenport I'm not sure if it has reached Beta yet, but this post explains how to enable it: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/20/chromes-experimental-chrome-home-interface-now-bottom-tabs-revamped-new-tab-page/ pfmiller That looks great, I guess I'll hold off updating until that is released since I don't want to lose my NTP recent tabs button. Why does Google always remove features before their replacement is ready, it's ridiculous. Tomáš Petrík I, for one, am sad not to be able to use the data: URL anymore. If I happened across a base64 encoded image, I could simply paste the data in the address bar, prepend it with the necessary stuff and I could see the image right away. Madis Where would you happen to come across one, though? The only good applications for that I know of are userscripts and userstyles. Tomáš Petrík Sometimes in a corrupted email, or in the source code of some plugin, etc. There are situations when I used the ability. Not many of them, but there are. Taomyn The WoSign and StartCom were actually blocked starting Chrome v57 on all platforms - I had to convert a few sites to use Let's Encrypt when it happened. Lars Jeppesen Let's Encrypt is the best TheC92 Condensed NTP layout, Google G in New Tab Page omnibox https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/29758165c5bacd5e58ee3e282a766920531bb91da3e6cf647c82e52138f278bb.png UnlikeABoss Speaking of HTTPS... Cough Cough, AP. Cmon folks. You're falling behind other, let's just say "lower quality", websites, when it comes to security. Corbin Davenport Don't worry, we're nearly there. UnlikeABoss Awesome.

Michael Oghia Do you know what the holdup is? Michael Hazell My guess is that they have some widgets/plugins on the site that are hard-coded to load things over HTTP. That, and back-end load concerns, although this is more of a thing of the past with the latest cipher suites. For a long time, even Disqus used to be a barrier. Kavan Trivedi Is this something new?? Any1 else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d9529f329ebbfb0f262209d944e48bb75217db79cbdc1e9af42760cfccdeeeb1.png Corbin Davenport Yep, that's new. Blake DeVoss I want nothing more than to disable Custom Tabs system-wide. Adam Margeson They have their uses, but at the same time I find myself agreeing with you. At the very least, it would be a nice option to have. F4LL0U7 Am I the only one who hates Chrome custom tabs? I have to turn them off in every f'ing app I install now. I wish there were a way to disable them across the board. I just want my web links to open in a web browser, so that I can keep the website open and still be able to go back to the app without closing the site. Is that so much to ask? Jordan L I'm with you on this. I don't like when apps open the webpage inside the app. I turn ON 'open webpages in external browser' when I can. F4LL0U7 Why are they forcefully removing our only way to get bookmarks & recents back on the new tab page? Seems like a purposefully bad UX. C Scott Willy AP missed a huge bug fix in 58. See https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/chrome-firefox-and-opera-users-beware-this-isnt-the-apple-com-you-want/ I confirm that going to https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/ made it look like you were going safely to https://www.apple.com/. This was on Chrome 57. I confirmed it is fixed on Chrome 58. Hopefully Opera and Firefox have fixes soon. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I just came to this article to see if this was "Google's Screwup Of The Day". Apparently not. Maybe later today.

Now, thanks to this latest update, Google Earth is replete with 3D imagery, curated video content, and other features that will either make you want to book a trip to some far-flung part of the world or just appreciate the Earth right from your own latitude and longitude coordinates. Or maybe both. Here are five things to try with the new Google Earth, which runs in Chrome on desktop and on Android for mobile users: Enjoy 3D Maps In earlier versions of Google Earth, certain buildings could be viewed in 3D, provided you checked off “3D Buildings” in the Layers portion of the app. But in the newest release of Google Earth, you can view, well, the whole world in 3D. When you search for a location, a clickable 2D/3D button appears on the lower right-hand corner of the screen, giving you a quick and easy way to look at your destination in another dimension. Have another dose of David Attenborough If Planet Earth II wasn’t enough to satisfy your love of nature, or you just can’t get enough of David Attenborough’s remarkably dignified narration of a lizard getting chased by hundreds of terrifying snakes, check out “Epic Hunts Caught on Camera.” Thanks to a partnership with BBC Earth, Google Earth now offers a series of short video clips narrated by Attenborough, which play in YouTube along the righthand side of the usual Earth view. If chimpanzees or underwater expeditions are more your thing, there’s also content from primatologist Jane Goodall and marine biologist Dr. Sylvia Earle. See Hemingway’s hangouts Ever want to see the places where Ernest Hemingway wrote his most important and influential works, ones that are second only to this blog post? Within the new “Voyage” tab in Google Earth, you can take a virtual tour of the Galapagos islands, the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya, and other UNESCO World Heritage sites; as well as cultural imprints like Hemingway’s hangouts, architecture by Zaha Hadid, and global perspectives on the different structures we call “home.” Get lost Did you know that before Europeans came to North America, so-called Mississippians “had built a great city surrounded by huge earthen pyramids and a Stonehenge-like structure made of wood to track the movements of the stars”? And that it’s still visible in Illinois? Me neither, but the new Google Earth highlights this structure, along with eight other architectural feats, forgotten lands, or relics of an ancient world. Go to Google Earth -> Voyage -> History -> Lost Civilizations from Above to find them. Feel lucky Google has ported its “I’m feeling lucky” button from its search engine to the new Google Earth, and it’s a glorious way to distract yourself at work or plan your next spontaneous trip. That’s all for now; gotta go catch a flight to Kasprowy Wierch. Next Up In Science Scientists and their supporters march in favor of actual facts in D.C.

Melanie MignucciApr 22, 2017 9:00AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestTim Graham *To celebrate Earth Day, Google’s Made with Code, an initiative which launched in 2014 to inspire millions of girls to learn to code, paired women from three NGOs (World Wildlife Fund, The Ocean Agency, and the Jane Goodall Institute) in conversation with three badass student scientists whose inventions are saving the earth, one oil spill, banana peel, or supercapacitor at a time. Along with a new project from Made with Code, where girls can code their own environmental awareness statement and share it online with the world, these conversations show how science, technology, engineering, and math come together to help combat environmental challenges. Here, we paired Tammy Palmer, vice president of Africa programs at the Jane Goodall Institute, with Elif Bilgin, a Turkish scientist who invented a bio-plastic that utilizes banana peels, to talk about their journeys in STEM.* Elif Bilgin: I'm a former Google Science Fair finalist. My project was about making bioplastic out of banana peels to replace the traditional petroleum-based plastic. I'm currently a student at Johns Hopkins University studying biomedical engineering and computer science. Tammy Palmer: I am the Jane Goodall Institute's vice president for Africa programs. I am one of the more unique people at JGI where I did not come in with a primatology degree; my skill set is around Africa. I am currently based in Kampala, Uganda. I'm really intrigued by your work because what you're doing is so singular, and I wanted to know what the impetus was for you to begin to think about using those resources innovatively? EB: What drew me to bioplastics was that I realized that even if I raised awareness regarding the problem of plastic pollution in the sea, there wasn't a replacement instead of the petroleum-based plastic. The problem I identified could not be solved until there was an alternate path that people could take. TP: Was there ever a trepidation on your part in your early thinking process? EB: Making bioplastic out of banana peels sounded like a ridiculous idea from the start. When I started experimenting, I had samples that did not become plasticized, or I had samples that were successfully made into plastic, and then they started rotting because I forgot to put a preservative in it. And one by one I built on that experience and found my final product. My advice to people who want to be involved in science is that failing is definitely a part of the process, and it's impossible to have a perfect experiment with no error. As long as you become comfortable with that fact, it's much less scary to participate in STEM. TP: How did you become aware that [pollution] was an issue you needed to solve for in the first place? EB: I'm from Istanbul, Turkey, the city right where Europe and Asia meet, and we have a sea connecting these two continents. When I was 14, I noticed there was a lot of plastic floating in the sea, and I realized this was a big problem. It's not specific to Turkey, it's a global issue that was then arising in many different parts of the world. I started researching how people have come up with solutions to this problem, and that's how I ran into the term bioplastics. Bioplastics were made from edible materials, like potatoes but the part that we eat, not the skin, and I realized that maybe I could use an organic waste material to recycle this material and replace petroleum-based plastic. TP: One of the things Jane Goodall always says is “knowledge leads to action.” What I hear in your story is a concrete example about how we at the institution have seen that as well — the more that we're able to create understanding of, then create actionable solutions, the more likely they are to be applied in a number of different contexts in the conservation space. It's not lost on me the fact that you're using banana peels, and of course chimps love bananas [laughs]. I can draw a very clear through-line between the work that you're doing in terms of pushing the applications of those bioplastics, and, once these ideas are brought to scale, how they can help us conserve chimpanzees and the habitats that they live in. Where do you see the role of personal values and wanting to make an impact in what you do? EB: My personal values are the driving force in all the projects I participate in. I identify a problem either in my own life or in the lives of people around me, and wanting to make an impact in the world drives me to actually finish the project that I start. TP: What things do you think young women could be doing to protect the environment? EB: The most influential way to solve the environmental problems is to raise awareness, and the way awareness can be raised in the most efficient and fast manner and the easiest manner is through social media. The internet is how we connect people across the globe. It's a giant network that allows information to reach another person within seconds, not even. Sharing a post about an environmental issue could cause five other people to share it, and they cause five other people to share it. This is the most efficient way to achieve environmental impact in the 21st century. TP: You participated in the Made With Code challenge, what was your environmental message that you coded? EB: I coded the Defend the Oceans message because it resonated with the plastic issue that I was aiming to solve. This project is really nice. At first it seems like you just drag things down and put them together to build a series of buttons, but when you click on the tab you can actually see the code behind every button and how it links to each other. This is really helpful in actually gaining a basic knowledge of what coding is. TP: One of the important parts of my job is to think through programs and project design and how we're actually going to get to the goal of conserving chimpanzees at the end of the day with whatever resources we have available. I was looking at the Made with Code objective of inspiring, activating, and sustaining — what do you think is the most difficult thing to do out of that? EB: As a little kid, you want to do everything, you think you can achieve anything, and it's excellent to plant seeds of inspiration in things like coding. To sustain this interest as they grow up is the most difficult one. We need to raise awareness from families, teachers, and companies to motivate girls to keep doing what they are doing. I think that coding, the more time you spend learning or developing your skills as a coder, the better you get. TP: What else is really important and valuable in terms of being successful at your work? EB: I believe that you have to be a team player. You can't be one individual trying to do the work of 8 people. TP: One of the models we use is a community conservation approach: until we put people at the center of conservation, we are not going to be able to conserve these beloved creatures. When you're talking about team efforts and team work, it really makes me think about that particular approach, [and how] we cannot solve the most challenging issues in isolation. What do you think that the tech field can learn from the field of design and creativity, and vice versa? EB: Design and creativity are very unique skills that are difficult to imitate through technology. Creativity is what makes us human, basically. Tech can help make tasks in the design and creativity field more efficient; for example, animation took off after coding got more popular. Now they draw everything on the computer and then they animate them on the computers. It takes less time to complete a project now than it did 10 years ago. TP: Technological efficiency is really important in conservation work as well. Looking at the coding side, what are some opportunities that would be important to create for young women? EB: This circles back to Google’s Made with Code — in their program, they've decided to activate interest in coding in girls by showing them [how] things they thought were unrelated to coding — like music, dance, or fashion — can be linked to coding. TP: My personal philosophy is about engaging people where they are, which is what I hear you talking about. If you're interested in selfies, if you're interested in fashion, if you're interested in those things why not design content around that to pull people in? There's so many different traditional conservation practices, that we're not necessarily aware of, but if we listen closely and engage in the right conversations, we'll hear about them.

Doing these small things could go a long way in helping save the only known planet in the universe that harbours life. “Whatever you do today, we hope you're able to take a moment to savour and cherish this boundless, stunning Earth that we inhabit,” Google said in a statement on the occasion of Earth Day 2017. At an estimated 4.543 billion years of age, the Earth is also the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. Earth Day 2017: What Major Tech Companies are Doing for the Planet Google's Earth Day doodle follows the story of a fox who dreams about an Earth that has been polluted and adversely affected by climate change. The fox wakes with a startle, and urgently starts making small lifestyle changes to care for the Earth.  Along the way, the fox enlists friends - including Momo the cat, and Google Weather's favourite frog - to join its quest to protect and nurture the environment. To combat things like coral bleaching and pollution, the three eco-rangers are inspired to take action such as eating less meat, carpooling, and unplugging unused electronic devices. “That's some heroic work for tiny animals!” Google doodle says. Can we humans do a little more? That is probably the question that will arise in everyone's mind after seeing the Google doodle. To help answer, Google is offering offers easy 'Earth Day tips’ via search results to help you do your part in saving our planet, including supporting critical conservation efforts such as wildlife conservation with World Wildlife Fund and coral reef conservation with The Ocean Agency.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones.

Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do.

No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ?

It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off.

Previously, Home only linked up to the account of whomever set it up first. Now, the device will be able to handle multiple accounts and tell who's speaking to it, offering personalized answers to some questions. (AP File Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Smart home hubs are continuing to evolve, and Google just added a pretty important feature to its own hub, the Google Home. Previously, Home only linked up to the account of whomever set it up first. Now, the device will be able to handle multiple accounts and tell who's speaking to it, offering personalized answers to some questions. That's a feature that Amazon's Echo doesn't have. And it's important for a voice assistant that's designed to run your household. For an assistant such as Siri, which lives on devices used by just one person, multi-account support isn't as important. But home hubs sit in a central location and operate things such as your lights or your thermostat that everyone will want to be able to control. Being able to identify an individual's voice may also help cut down on some unwanted surprises. Google said in a statement that the new feature makes it so that "only you would be able to shop via Google Home." So others -- i.e., your kids or an intelligent parrot -- shouldn't be able to tell Home to buy something on your account. That avoids instances like one in San Diego this January when Amazon Echo units started ordering dollhouses after hearing a news anchor said "Alexa ordered me a dollhouse." The anchor was reporting on a story about -- what else? -- a child buying something without permission on the Echo. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) That said, the company also noted the voice feature isn't yet foolproof. "We're just getting started and we won't be perfect," the statement said. "We don't recommend that users rely upon voice identification as a security feature." While there are benefits to having home hubs distinguish different voices, there are also some privacy implications to think about. Consumers worried about their voice data being collected in general should think twice before picking up a home hub, said Bradley Shear, of the privacy-focused, Maryland-based Shear Law. With this new feature, he said, it's worth keeping in mind that Google will have even more specific information about you, which could be used in ways that consumers may not realize -- particularly if it's combined with other information tied to your Google account. Consumers should also think about how this information could be used outside of the company, Shear said. He pointed to a recent murder case in Arkansas where police asked Amazon for audio recorded from the suspect's home hub, the Echo. (Amazon originally fought the order before the suspect agreed to share the information.) Shear said that case illustrated how recordings made in your home may end up being used in unexpected ways. "It has a clean voiceprint from you," Shear said, speaking of the new feature. "Once something is digitized, you don't know where it could end up." After all, while both Google Home and Alexa devices only collect voice data when you use their respective wake phrases -- "Alexa," "Ok Google" or "Hey Google" -- anyone who owns one of these devices also knows that they can sometimes trigger by accident. That opens up the potential for comments you make in private to be taken out of context or shared to an audience you never intended, particularly if the recording can be definitively identified as your voice. (Users can wipe their voice recordings from their Google accounts, per the company's privacy policy.) From a usability standpoint, there are also some problems with these hubs that identifying individuals by voice can't fix. This won't solve the "Burger King" problem of commercials being able to trigger the Google Home through your television. Anyone in range of the Google Home will still be able to use its non-personalized features. So even if you don't create an account for your guests or your children, they'll still be able to ask it to do things such as answer questions, set timers, or play videos on a Chromecast. To set up the new feature, users will have to hop in to the Google Home app, which should have a new option for "multi-user" support on any connected Google Home connected to your network. Home owners can add up to six accounts, according to a company blog post. Google Home owners will have to teach the hub how to identify their voices by saying "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" twice into the device, when prompted. This allows it to learn different characteristics of each person's voice. This kind of training should be familiar to anyone who uses Siri, or the voice assistant on Google's phones -- the key difference being that you'll have to go through it multiple times on Home, depending on how many accounts you want to hook up. Google said that it will use its network to "compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so we can understand if it's you speaking or not." The company promises this should only take a few milliseconds. The feature is rolling out to all U.S. users. Google said it also plans to bring this feature to the United Kingdom in "the coming months."

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)   Brian Fung The Washington Post     Uber has not had a great start to the year. The ride-hailing company has been reeling from a public battering over claims of willful discrimination, allegations of intellectual-property theft and the departure of several executives. The controversies have resurfaced a debate over Uber's hard-charging internal culture and the consequences of its win-at-any-cost attitude to business and regulation. If you're having trouble keeping up with all the Uber news, here's a brief history of its struggles in 2017. --- Late January Hundreds of thousands of Uber customers reportedly canceled their accounts in response to the #deleteUber social media campaign after the company continued to run service while taxis were on strike at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The strike was to protest President Donald Trump's travel ban targeting foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Some users viewed Uber's decision to continue to pick up passengers as an attempt at profiteering. Uber suffered a 10 percent drop in rides that weekend, according to some estimates. Feb. 2 Amid continuing criticism for not suspending service to JFK over the travel ban, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick stepped down from his position as a strategic adviser to Trump. Kalanick had been a member of a special advisory council to the White House that included Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and a number of other executives. Critics had questioned Kalanick's role with the administration. In a companywide memo, Kalanick said that he did not intend for his membership on the council to be interpreted as an endorsement of Trump's policies. Feb. 21 Uber suddenly found itself embroiled in a sexual harassment controversy after a blog post by Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, went viral. In her post, Fowler outlined a number of allegations against the company and said that her reports of inappropriate sexual attention from a manager went largely ignored and that Uber's human resources department blamed her for "[being] the problem." The incident created a social media firestorm, prompting Kalanick to announce an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Uber sent users intent on deleting their accounts messages saying that employees were "deeply hurting" in light of the blog post and that the allegations went "against everything Uber stands for." Feb. 23 Uber again landed in hot water when Google's self-driving car spinoff, Waymo, filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing company that threatens to halt Uber's progress in developing its self-driving car. The suit accuses a former Google executive, Anthony Levandowski, of stealing sophisticated self-driving technology from Google before leaving to form his own self-driving truck company, which was then acquired by Uber. Google is an investor in Uber, and the relationship between the two firms has grown increasingly competitive as both work to dominate the race to build a mainstream self-driving car. Feb. 27 Amit Singhal, another top Google employee who left to join Uber, stepped down after a report that he failed to disclose the real reason he left the search giant -- namely, that he had been accused of sexual harassment while at Google. Singhal voluntarily departed Google, and was later asked by Kalanick to leave Uber, according to news reports. Feb. 28 Kalanick made headlines again when he got into an argument with an Uber driver over fares. The encounter, which was caught on video, showed Kalanick boasting about how hard he drives his employees and accusing the driver of failing to take responsibility for his own income. The driver pointed out that Uber has repeatedly lowered wages for its drivers. Kalanick ended the trip by sarcastically wishing the driver luck. Kalanick later apologized and said that he needed "leadership help." The company said it was looking for a chief operating officer to work with Kalanick. "I must fundamentally change and grow up," Kalanick said in a blog post. March 2 Uber relented in a high-profile legal fight with California regulators, saying it would agree to file for a testing permit for its self-driving cars after it had launched a test fleet in San Francisco without a permit. The news was a defeat for Uber, which had resisted following in the footsteps of its competitors in the autonomous vehicle space. Uber had argued late last year that it was exempt from the testing regulation because it had human drivers at the wheel. California authorities, however, did not budge, prompting Uber to move much of its testing to Arizona in December. March 3 Reports surfaced that Uber had used a secret tool, known as Greyball, that allowed the company to circumvent government investigators in a yearslong game of cat-and-mouse. The tool was designed to help Uber avoid abusive riders, but the company started using it to thwart regulators in places where the service was restricted or banned. Uber used Greyball to serve members of law enforcement a fake version of the app designed to prevent them from successfully hailing rides when investigating the company's practices. Uber also turned Greyball on cabdrivers to thwart them from using the Uber app to learn the whereabouts of Uber drivers. The revelation was a reminder of other covert actions Uber had taken to defeat its competition. March 16 An analysis of Uber's self-driving car metrics showed that the company's autonomous vehicles needed constant micromanagement, according to a news report. The company's human testers had to intervene on average once per mile, Re/code reported, raising questions about the readiness of the company's autonomous cars despite a high-profile launch in Pittsburgh months before. By comparison, Google said in January that its human drivers need to take over its self-driving vehicles once every 5,000 miles, made more impressive by the fact that Google has logged many more miles than some companies working on autonomous vehicles. March 19 Uber's president, Jeff Jones, said he was leaving the company over the sexual harassment allegations that were dogging the firm. "The beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride-sharing business," Jones said in a statement to Re/code. March 25 Uber briefly suspended its self-driving car testing at the end of March, a day after one of its autonomous vehicles got into a crash in Arizona. April 4 Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto told The Wall Street Journal that he was quickly becoming disillusioned with Uber despite being one of the company's biggest champions when it launched a self-driving program in his city. Peduto said that Uber was not doing enough to fulfill its moral obligations to Pittsburgh residents. For example, he said that Uber had walked away from commitments that could have helped Pittsburgh win a competition sponsored by the Department of Transportation known as the Smart Cities Challenge. That initiative came with $50 million in grant money for designing next-generation transportation technologies. Uber said its investments had helped "put Pittsburgh on the self-driving map" and created jobs for the city. April 11 Rachel Whetstone, Uber's top communications executive, said she was leaving the company, making her the latest in a slew of executive departures. Whetstone, who had also worked previously at Google, reportedly clashed with Kalanick over how to handle crisis communications, according to reports. Roughly half a dozen senior Uber staffers have departed the company in recent months. April 12 According to a report by The Information, Uber operated a top-secret program known as "Hell," which sought to identify drivers for Uber competitor Lyft. The program not only helped Uber in locating Lyft drivers, potentially giving Uber a competitive advantage, the report said, but could also identify which Lyft drivers also drove for Uber. Those drivers would then be singled out for special driver-retention efforts, meaning that they were treated differently from Uber's most loyal workers. Legal analysts said the program could be viewed as an example of an "unfair business practice," which could land Uber in court. April 14 California regulators said that Uber may be subject to more than $1 million in fines after the company repeatedly failed to take action against drivers that passengers said were driving drunk. Uber investigated only 13 percent of passenger reports about drunken driving, according to California's Public Utility Commission. Uber has promoted its ride-hailing service, in part, by arguing that it reduces drunken driving by keeping inebriated passengers from getting behind the steering wheel.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > How Google Earth helped Jane Goodall save a… How Google Earth helped Jane Goodall save a generation of chimpanzees By Julian Chokkattu — April 22, 2017 3:00 AM Subscribe Share In the early 2000s, Jane Goodall and Lilian Pintea combed through Tanzania with Google Earth for the first time and were shocked to see the rate of deforestation affecting the area surrounding Gombe, home of the chimpanzees Goodall had so famously studied in the 1960s. If left unchecked, the deforestation would eventually destroy the habitat of the chimps. Goodall, the primatologist who debunked the thought that humans are the only animals to use tools, believed she had to put a stop to the damage. So she began to engage with the surrounding communities, making local villagers “partners in conservation.” The habitat was important for the chimps, whose populations had dwindled from millions to below 300,000 in Africa over the span of just a few decades. Goodall’s desire to engage with communities is also where a surprising relationship developed between Google and the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI). Goodall made a presentation at the tech company’s headquarters in 2006, describing the usefulness of tools such as Google Earth. Soon after, Google Earth Outreach was born. It’s a charity program Google uses to donate and promote non-profit organizations. “I think the relationship was about recognizing that Google, as a tech company, was at the forefront of innovative technology,” Lilian Pintea, vice president of Conservation Science at the institute, told Digital Trends. “Google Earth Outreach is a group of people interested to asking the ‘so what’ question, ‘how can this help for good. We’re on the ground asking the same question.” You don’t need a degree to explore Google Earth. As Google began helping more, Pintea said JGI took part in the process of trying out new tools in collaboration with the Google Earth team. Some new features would work well, while others … not so much, but the collaboration paid off. Google Earth played a crucial role in sharing geospatial information with the local decision makers in the Gombe area. It allowed them to map out where chimpanzees were sighted, and helped get villagers interested in preserving those areas. The service worked because it was made for local communities and didn’t require a strong internet connection, Pintea said, which are vital traits to have in rural Africa. You didn’t need to have a degree to explore Google Earth; and zooming into specific areas automatically cached (downloaded) the data for offline use. “One decision maker asked me, ‘how many acres is my farm,’ Pintea said. “I provide that information [with Google Earth], and he says ‘okay, this is useful; now what did you want to talk about chimpanzees?’ We provided that connection.” Smartphones for forest monitors Goodall’s connection to Google evolved when JGI, in consultation with the local communities, began a program where local villagers acted as forest monitors in their areas. They were equipped with GPS devices, and they logged data every half hour about wildlife they saw, signs of tree cutting, and their location so it could be plotted onto Google Earth. The growing disconnect between the GPS equipment and Google Earth soon became a problem. “GPS was working fine, but as you know GPS just gives you coordinates and the observations were captured on paper forms,” Pintea said. “One year, 16 village forest monitors collected more than 30,000 points [of interest]. Who is going to digitize it? Who is going to look through them?” Those questions were answered with the 2008 launch of the T-Mobile G1, also known as the HTC Dream — the first smartphone from Google and HTC to run Google’s fledgling Android operating system. Rebecca Moore, director of engineering at Google Earth invited Pintea to Brazil in 2009, where local indigenous communities were using the G1 and an app called Open Data Kit (ODK) to log data helpful to inform land conservation decisions. He said it was “amazing,” to see people who had never use GPS or smartphones before easily use the G1. So Google donated some Android devices to JGI. Together, the two organizations encountered some strange issues they never thought about, like how some villager’s fingers were so rough they couldn’t register the touch screen, or how locals would have to end up using generators to charge the devices. Fun fact — Google later donated 1,000 Nexus 7 (2012) devices when the tablet launched, and Pintea said he still has 50 or so left. These G1 phones were stripped of most apps since the priority was to save battery power and keep forest monitors focused on using the ODK app to make note of “illegal human activities, as well as the presence of chimpanzees and other wildlife.” Their data was then sent to Google’s cloud service where Pintea and JGO colleagues in Tanzania would share it with local stakeholders and decision makers. These Android smartphones gave village forest monitors power. While data transparency is important, JGI, the local community, and the local government decided to password protect information collected by the village forest monitors. Otherwise it could potentially provide sensitive information for poachers, such as what areas were being monitored, and geographical points of where wildlife were sighted. JGI’s ultimate goal is engaging and building the capacity of the community to enforce their land-use plans to protect the environment, Pintea said. “The village government selects the person — we have no say,” Pintea said, about how forest monitors are chosen. “So when we give that mobile phone, it’s not to a person, it’s to the community and to a person, who the community trusted to monitor the forest on their behalf. There’s some social engagement there, and of course at some point there’s pride for him or her to have this phone.” Training people how to use these phones was easy, but changing their perspectives to why data collection is important, why data should be used to make decisions, and why people need to change their lives to manage forests is hard, and takes time. Jane Goodall Institute Jane Goodall Institute Jane Goodall Institute Forest monitors are training to use Android mobile phones to collect GPS observations of the status and trends of their village forests, wildlife, and threats. Jane Goodall Institute A Conservation Action Plan workshop: A series of meetings led by the Jane Goodall Institute to identify strategies and actions to reduce the threats to great apes and their habitat in a critical landscape of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Still, these Android smartphones gave village forest monitors power. In the past, if someone went to the village chairman and mentioned a large tree cut, with GPS coordinates, the chairman could have brushed it off. Now, the capability to take georeferenced pictures empowers forest monitors to offer crucial evidence. “One village monitor reported a bullet cartridge — he took a picture, and reported it to the cloud,” Pintea said. “He said, ‘I took the picture because I went to my village chairman, and said I never saw a bullet cartridge on our village land, but now it’s because the forest is restoring — wildlife is coming back, and so are wildlife hunters.’ He doesn’t need a sophisticated statistical analysis to convince the chairman that the village needs to deal with a new threat.” Going back with Street View Smartphones and tablets are just one part of the equation. Now, Pintea and the team are using drones, and he’s also working with the Google Street View team. “It’s not necessarily obvious that Street View would be applicable for conservation.” “It’s been really interesting watching this partnership evolve over the last 10 years in ways we never could have predicted,” Tanya Birch, program manager on Google Earth Outreach, told Digital Trends. “As we’re building the next new exciting thing that’s coming out from Google, I always think about how could JGI use this — you know it’s not necessarily obvious that Street View would be applicable for conservation.” When Pintea saw Google’s Street View launch, he immediately thought of ways it could help JGI work in land-use planning and habitat conservation. It’s why in 2013, he and his colleagues carried backpacks equipped with cameras from Google in 2013 and trekked his way through Gombe, street view mapping areas JGI wanted to monitor in the future. The plan is to return this summer and do a similar trek, thankfully with a much smaller 360-degree camera. That way, they can compare the two data sets to see how the environment has changed on the ground level, complementing the perspective from the satellite level. Pintea called it “ground-truthing satellite imagery.” What are the results? Gombe acted as a testing ground for the village forest monitoring project, and JGI’s efforts to engage the community in following land-use plans has paid off. Take a look at the two pictures below: Google Earth Google Earth Left: 2005; Right: 2014 Trees are growing again. The area surrounding Gombe is no longer just bare hills. Google, JGI, Global Forest Watch, and the World Resources Institute also helped create a forest-monitoring app, which is now in a beta pilot program in Uganda and other countries around the world. The Forest Watcher app offers near real-time tree cover loss data via satellites, and it can send notification alerts to users about potential illegal logging activities. JGI expanded its village forest monitoring model to Uganda, where it now engages more than 200 community members and protected area rangers. “I think with Google Earth and its storytelling capabilities — I see a lot of exciting promise for more stories we can develop, giving other people a global understanding of what’s happening in the world,” Birch said. What technology and groups like JGI have done also democratize the process of research gathering all over the world. Before, a scientist would get a government’s approval, pay a fee, and hire locals as guides. Now, the process could involve engaging the local community to help gather data, while paying them as well. “The word empowering is so overused,” Birch said. “But it really fits here. Suddenly, people are listening to you. It’s not just, ‘I saw some deforestation over there,’ ‘yeah, who cares?’ Maybe a few people, but when it’s many, many people all recording information which feeds into a global map of deforestation — then you can start talking about how that factors into climate change and global processes. Data collected on the ground is a critical piece of the puzzle.” In other words, this data and work is influencing national and global decisions about climate change. But for the Jane Goodall Institute, it also goes back to saving the chimpanzees.

By Sarmistha Acharya April 22, 2017 13:01 BST Google Play Music is now on new Samsung phones and tabletsGoogle Google on Friday (21 April) said it has teamed up with Samsung to offer its music streaming service on new Galaxy phones and tablets launched in 2017. The announcement coincides with the launch of Galaxy S8 and S8+, which will of course get the service. Google Play Music would be the default music player on Samsung's new mobile devices. So what will you get with the Google Play Music on your Galaxy S8 and other mobile devices? Google says users can upload and stream up to 100,000 songs to the music player, which is twice as much the capacity offered exclusively to Samsung consumers. Besides, users can easily transfer their personal music collection from any other services to Google Play Music. So if you have a new Galaxy S8, S8+, Galaxy Tab S3 or any other new Samsung Galaxy device, you will get a free three-month trial of Google Play Music. After the free trial window closes, you will get ad-free on-demand access to more than 40 million songs and thousands of playlists if you choose to subscribe. Users can also get access to YouTube Red where they can watch ad-free videos during the trial period. In another significant integration, Google Play Music will work with Bixby when it launches officially this spring. So Galaxy S8 and S8+ users can ask Bixby to play songs on Google Play Music.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate...

He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off. Rest of the settings are stock out of the box. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d6d107fe72843084747728a2ff7d6ed0c69dbb8828498d680a8e574909c8d80.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/69216e0f531ae12996c1fea6d785844e4b1d5cb6f74e5a1f1b39973b6d6f25d5.png Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

One of the best things about being an Android fan is that there’s a large variety of smartphones to choose from. Things get even better, Android smartphones don’t have an expiration date most of the time because Google keeps on providing them with software updates. However, even though Google might decide to stop supporting them, Android users can always manually flash custom ROMs on their smartphones. Today we’re going to present three Android powered smartphones which can be acquired for rather cheap prices. Two of them are going to be Google’s own Nexus 6 and Nexus 5X while the third one is going to be Xiaomi Redmi 3S. Without any further ado, let’s get into it. Display Nexus 5X has been fitted with a 5.2 inch display which offers a full HD pixel resolution of 1080 x 1920. Nexus 6 ships with an even large 5.2 inch panel that features a high pixel resolution of 1440 x 2560. Last but not least, Xiaomi Redmi 3S has been equipped with a 5.0 inch display which presents a HD pixel resolution of 720 x 1280. Hardware Power LG has been the manufacturer behind Nexus 5X and it has equipped the smartphone with Qualcomm’s hexa-core Snapdragon 808 CPU that’s been paired with an Adreno 418GPU and 2GB RAM. Nexus 6 is also using one of Qualcomm’s highly powerful quad-core Snapdragon 805 CPU that’s been coupled with an Adreno 420 GPU and 3GB of RAM. Finally, Redmi 3S is fueled by Qualcomm’s slower octa-core Snapdragon 430 that’s been fitted with an Adreno 505 GPU and 3GB of RAM. Final Words As we all can see, these three smartphones are quite powerful. Nexus 5X features the most powerful processor, but its RAM memory is quite small. Redmi 3S comes with the best GPU, but it’s processor lacks in power. This leaves Nexus 6 as being the overall best smartphone. Obviously, Nexus 6 is nowhere near flawless, but it performs exceptionally well in all hardware departments and not just one.

Twitter Facebook OK, Google, let's put the new voice ID everywhere Google Home now recognizes who you are when you talk to it. This technology is too powerful and useful to leave at Home. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 22 April, 2017 21:00 - - - - print email Comments Google Home knows who's talking. When each recognized user speaks Home's wake words — which are "Hey, Google" and "OK, Google" — Home now switches to that person's account to give personalized information. This is a huge deal, a technological marvel and a major leap forward in human-machine interaction. It's also a cautionary tale about the downside of overzealous concern about privacy. How Google Home knows you're you Google Home is a virtual assistant appliance similar to the Amazon Echo that runs a version of the Google Assistant. Assistant is also available in Google's Allo messaging app. [ Further reading: 3 months with Google Home: Fun, functional, and frustrating ] Google Home now supports up to six users for a single device. The new capability started rolling out to U.S. users this week, and Google promises U.K. availability "in the coming months." When the feature becomes available to you, the Google Home mobile app will present a card that says "multi-user is available." By tapping on that message, the app will walk you through the setup process. Alternatively, you can tap on Devices, Settings, More, then Shared Devices to drill down to the multi-user options. The setup process enables you to initially "train" Home to know your voice and distinguish it from other people's voices. This user recognition is only for the wake words. It does this using neural network artificial intelligence, according to Google. While there's a required initial training process, the voice training continues in the background to continuously refine recognition, according to a Google representative. Before we move on, let's savor this technological achievement for a moment. Google's A.I. is so good that with two repetitions each of "Hey, Google" and "OK, Google," the Home device will recognize you when you say those words in the future. The processing takes place not in some massive remote data center, but right on the Home device itself. And it gets better over time all by itself. Why this is such a big deal Google's announcement pointed out the obvious benefits of user recognition, which include the ability of Home to offer "my own personal playlists, my own commute time, my own schedule and more." Already, privacy advocates are complaining. One expert told the The Washington Post that "consumers worried about their voice data being collected in general should think twice before picking up a home hub" and that the feature "could be used in ways that consumers may not realize — particularly if it's combined with other information tied to your Google account." This advice is misplaced. A Google representative told me that the identification of particular users on Google Home is "kept local on the device and not used for other services." It's also important to realize that the voice recognition is used exclusively for switching from one account to another. Once the account is switched, Home stops recognizing your voice and the voice data (including the audio recording) is then associated with your account. In the past, all data was associated with the account of the person who set up the Home device in the first place. For example, let's say mom bought a Google Home gadget and set it up in the living room using her Google account. From that point on, whenever dad, the kids, friends or the in-laws used the Google Home, all that data (regarding the content of the query) was associated with mom's account, and was therefore almost useless for improving Google's understanding and personalization of services for mom. Now that Home can switch accounts with each user, data is theoretically usable in the same way that Google Search data or browsing history or YouTube searches are usable. Google could harvest data from your Google Home device, including your music, food, travel and search preferences, and combine this with other signals as you use the Internet while logged in to your Google account to offer better suggestions and more relevant advertising. Google is transparent about recording your voice, and makes all your recordings available to you in a searchable format here on the Google Dashboard. This is no different from using Google Assistant on Allo, where activity is faithfully associated with the proper account. In fact, when you use any virtual assistant on a smartphone — including Apple's Siri, Microsoft'sCortana, or Samsung's new Bixby — your spoken-voice command and queries are connected to your individual personal accounts. In short, Google Home's new ability to recognize users does not represent a new privacy threat. Not even close. It merely brings virtual assistant appliances to parity with smartphone-based virtual assistants in terms of associating activity with specific users. In fact, the ability of Home to recognize users and switch accounts accordingly is a positive and inevitable development. The glorious future of user-voice recognition If someone uses your Google Home and the user isn't recognized, Home will work anyway. The ideal scenario for Google Home and all voice-based virtual assistants would be for the devices to work only when they recognize the user. This feature would require higher quality user identification technology, which is surely coming, and would enhance both smartphone- and appliance-based virtual assistants. Burger King recently used a 15-second TV commercial to trigger Google Home devices. The actor in the add said, "OK, Google: What is the Whopper Burger?" This shameless and irresponsible stunt was shut down by Google, which instructed Home devices to ignore the ad. But in the world of viral campaigns, there's no such thing as bad publicity. The add didn't trigger Google Home devices, but did trigger the media, which went on to write more about Burger King and Whoppers than it has in recent memory. Still, if virtual assistant appliances didn't respond to strangers, then future ads (or podcasts, radio shows and TV shows) wouldn't be able to interact with your device without your permission. A greater concern is when virtual assistant appliances are connected to home appliances. Right now, a stranger shouting through a window at an Amazon Echo or Google Home device can theoretically turn on whatever's connected — the lights, oven, TV or sprinkler system — or even unlock the front door. Today, it's a very bad idea to have your doors, windows or burglar alarms activated by voice. But in the future, when such appliances are really good at recognizing voices, we'll be able to connect all of our home devices without fear of unwanted strangers triggering them. Unless privacy fears prevent it, voice recognition will be so good we should be able to use our voices to log in to all kinds of services on other devices, including other people's virtual assistant appliances, but also ATMs and security gates. Eventually, we could start our self-driving cars using voice alone. (We could get into the car and say "OK, Google Car, take me to work," but if someone else does that it wouldn't go anywhere.) Google's caution in how the new user identification feature is implemented reveals how gun-shy Google is about violating user privacy. While actual biometric privacy violations are a real and serious threat, the secondary threat is that ignorance and fear will prevent us from gaining enormous benefits. Voice identification can, should and must be made very secure, enabling us to enjoy what's possible without compromising our privacy or personal information. It will always be more secure and less prone to abuse than face recognition, as I explained last month. Most importantly of all, voice is a democratizing interface. Millions or possibly billions of people cannot use smartphones to any significant extent. We all have older parents, grandparents or great-grandparents who can't or won't use most of the features of their phones and see them as too complex. Others don't have the physical mobility to use screen-based interfaces or keyboards. (I have one relative who never communicates online because he finds computers too complicated and typing too daunting.) It can be easy to dismiss this problem as insignificant, even as it puts non-users at an increasing disadvantage over time. Our mobile devices, computers and networks are sophisticated enough now to enable the full power of the internet to anyone who can talk. As Google Home's newest feature demonstrates, "just talking" can now enable people to log in to their accounts as well. So let's proceed with caution, but also perspective and optimism. In other words, let's hold companies accountable for privacy. But let's also not pressure them into hobbling future technologies out of unreasonable privacy fears. We need to continue down this path and enable the full development and wide distribution of simple voice-based user identification of the kind that now exists in Google Home.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do...

Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

This technology is too powerful and useful to leave at Home. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 22 April, 2017 21:00 - - - - print email Comments Google Home knows who's talking. When each recognized user speaks Home's wake words — which are "Hey, Google" and "OK, Google" — Home now switches to that person's account to give personalized information. This is a huge deal, a technological marvel and a major leap forward in human-machine interaction. It's also a cautionary tale about the downside of overzealous concern about privacy. How Google Home knows you're you Google Home is a virtual assistant appliance similar to the Amazon Echo that runs a version of the Google Assistant. Assistant is also available in Google's Allo messaging app. [ Further reading: 3 months with Google Home: Fun, functional, and frustrating ] Google Home now supports up to six users for a single device. The new capability started rolling out to U.S. users this week, and Google promises U.K. availability "in the coming months." When the feature becomes available to you, the Google Home mobile app will present a card that says "multi-user is available." By tapping on that message, the app will walk you through the setup process. Alternatively, you can tap on Devices, Settings, More, then Shared Devices to drill down to the multi-user options. The setup process enables you to initially "train" Home to know your voice and distinguish it from other people's voices. This user recognition is only for the wake words. It does this using neural network artificial intelligence, according to Google. While there's a required initial training process, the voice training continues in the background to continuously refine recognition, according to a Google representative. Before we move on, let's savor this technological achievement for a moment. Google's A.I. is so good that with two repetitions each of "Hey, Google" and "OK, Google," the Home device will recognize you when you say those words in the future. The processing takes place not in some massive remote data center, but right on the Home device itself. And it gets better over time all by itself. Why this is such a big deal Google's announcement pointed out the obvious benefits of user recognition, which include the ability of Home to offer "my own personal playlists, my own commute time, my own schedule and more." Already, privacy advocates are complaining. One expert told the The Washington Post that "consumers worried about their voice data being collected in general should think twice before picking up a home hub" and that the feature "could be used in ways that consumers may not realize — particularly if it's combined with other information tied to your Google account." This advice is misplaced. A Google representative told me that the identification of particular users on Google Home is "kept local on the device and not used for other services." It's also important to realize that the voice recognition is used exclusively for switching from one account to another. Once the account is switched, Home stops recognizing your voice and the voice data (including the audio recording) is then associated with your account. In the past, all data was associated with the account of the person who set up the Home device in the first place. For example, let's say mom bought a Google Home gadget and set it up in the living room using her Google account. From that point on, whenever dad, the kids, friends or the in-laws used the Google Home, all that data (regarding the content of the query) was associated with mom's account, and was therefore almost useless for improving Google's understanding and personalization of services for mom. Now that Home can switch accounts with each user, data is theoretically usable in the same way that Google Search data or browsing history or YouTube searches are usable. Google could harvest data from your Google Home device, including your music, food, travel and search preferences, and combine this with other signals as you use the Internet while logged in to your Google account to offer better suggestions and more relevant advertising. Google is transparent about recording your voice, and makes all your recordings available to you in a searchable format here on the Google Dashboard. This is no different from using Google Assistant on Allo, where activity is faithfully associated with the proper account. In fact, when you use any virtual assistant on a smartphone — including Apple's Siri, Microsoft'sCortana, or Samsung's new Bixby — your spoken-voice command and queries are connected to your individual personal accounts. In short, Google Home's new ability to recognize users does not represent a new privacy threat. Not even close. It merely brings virtual assistant appliances to parity with smartphone-based virtual assistants in terms of associating activity with specific users. In fact, the ability of Home to recognize users and switch accounts accordingly is a positive and inevitable development. The glorious future of user-voice recognition If someone uses your Google Home and the user isn't recognized, Home will work anyway. The ideal scenario for Google Home and all voice-based virtual assistants would be for the devices to work only when they recognize the user. This feature would require higher quality user identification technology, which is surely coming, and would enhance both smartphone- and appliance-based virtual assistants. Burger King recently used a 15-second TV commercial to trigger Google Home devices. The actor in the add said, "OK, Google: What is the Whopper Burger?" This shameless and irresponsible stunt was shut down by Google, which instructed Home devices to ignore the ad. But in the world of viral campaigns, there's no such thing as bad publicity. The add didn't trigger Google Home devices, but did trigger the media, which went on to write more about Burger King and Whoppers than it has in recent memory. Still, if virtual assistant appliances didn't respond to strangers, then future ads (or podcasts, radio shows and TV shows) wouldn't be able to interact with your device without your permission. A greater concern is when virtual assistant appliances are connected to home appliances. Right now, a stranger shouting through a window at an Amazon Echo or Google Home device can theoretically turn on whatever's connected — the lights, oven, TV or sprinkler system — or even unlock the front door. Today, it's a very bad idea to have your doors, windows or burglar alarms activated by voice. But in the future, when such appliances are really good at recognizing voices, we'll be able to connect all of our home devices without fear of unwanted strangers triggering them. Unless privacy fears prevent it, voice recognition will be so good we should be able to use our voices to log in to all kinds of services on other devices, including other people's virtual assistant appliances, but also ATMs and security gates. Eventually, we could start our self-driving cars using voice alone. (We could get into the car and say "OK, Google Car, take me to work," but if someone else does that it wouldn't go anywhere.) Google's caution in how the new user identification feature is implemented reveals how gun-shy Google is about violating user privacy. While actual biometric privacy violations are a real and serious threat, the secondary threat is that ignorance and fear will prevent us from gaining enormous benefits. Voice identification can, should and must be made very secure, enabling us to enjoy what's possible without compromising our privacy or personal information. It will always be more secure and less prone to abuse than face recognition, as I explained last month. Most importantly of all, voice is a democratizing interface. Millions or possibly billions of people cannot use smartphones to any significant extent. We all have older parents, grandparents or great-grandparents who can't or won't use most of the features of their phones and see them as too complex. Others don't have the physical mobility to use screen-based interfaces or keyboards. (I have one relative who never communicates online because he finds computers too complicated and typing too daunting.) It can be easy to dismiss this problem as insignificant, even as it puts non-users at an increasing disadvantage over time. Our mobile devices, computers and networks are sophisticated enough now to enable the full power of the internet to anyone who can talk. As Google Home's newest feature demonstrates, "just talking" can now enable people to log in to their accounts as well. So let's proceed with caution, but also perspective and optimism. In other words, let's hold companies accountable for privacy. But let's also not pressure them into hobbling future technologies out of unreasonable privacy fears. We need to continue down this path and enable the full development and wide distribution of simple voice-based user identification of the kind that now exists in Google Home.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 22, 2017 4:37 pm Apple and Google have released press statements describing how the two companies are celebrating Earth Day 2017. Apple and Google have released press statements describing how the two companies are celebrating Earth Day 2017. Apple has rolled out a series of videos featuring interviews from employees who talk about company’s climate change initiative. Google has unveiled a new Doodle, clicking on which takes users to Search page with Earth Day tips to help our planet. Apple’s animated videos have been created in collaboration with artist James Blagden. Further, Apple has said its new headquarters Apple Park is “world’s largest naturally ventilated building” with 5 million square feet of grassy fields, and drought-resistant trees. Apple Park, which is powered by 100 percent renewable energy, won’t require heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. Additionally, Apple has introduced a new Earth Day Challenge that requires customers to get outside and complete a workout of at least 30 minutes to receive a special achievement badge in the Messages app. Apple has already said it is planning to use 100 per cent recycled material to manufacture its products. According to the Cupertino technology giant, it has started using aluminum enclosures Liam recovered from iPhone 6 to create Mac mini computers. “Apple has announced it is now powering 96 percent of its operations with renewable energy in the company’s offices, retail stores, and product distribution centers. Apple is now 100 percent renewable in 24 countries, including all of its data centers,” Apple’s press statement reads. Google’s Earth Day Doodle tells the story of a fox who wakes up startled thanks to his dream about a polluted Earth. Up next, he decides to make a change by doing small things such as planting tress, eating less meat, turning off lights when no one’s in room, using bicycle etc. “By clicking beyond the Doodle to Google Search, you’ll find easy Earth Day tips to help you do your part in saving our planet, including supporting critical conservation efforts such as wildlife conservation with World Wildlife Fund, coral reef conservation with The Ocean Agency, and rainforest conservation with The Jane Goodall Institute,” said Google in a press statement.

While that seems counter-intuitive for a company that makes most of its money through advertising, it’s actually not the worst idea ever. The feature will block certain types of ads that ruin users’ browsing experience, such as pop-ups, auto-playing videos with sound, sticky ads that take up a lot of screen real estate and prestitials that count down before you can get to the content you meant to see. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT These are defined as unacceptable by an industry group called the Coalition for Better Ads, which includes members like Google and Facebook. Google might alternatively choose to block every ad on sites that include any offending ads at all – making site owners responsible for ensuring that the ads they host are up to code. Introducing ad blocking functionality of its own could help Google negate the need for users to install third-party extensions like Eyeo’s AdBlock Plus. The tool charges advertisers – including Google – a fee to be included in its ‘Acceptable Ads’ program and to whitelist their ads. If the search giant creates its own solution, it might eventually be able to avoid paying Eyeo or anyone else to run ads. That could be huge when you consider the fact that ads earned Google $60 billion in revenues last year, and that Chrome accounts for nearly half all browsers used in the US. The company declined to comment at this time, but hopefully we’ll know more about its plans sooner than later.

Special Features) 2 Reviews By Critics 3 Rate & Review v2 and Content Filters v2 4 Pre-Registration For Apps 5 Wrap-Up For the last couple of months, we've seen a lot of big things happening for Drive, Maps, Search, and even the News & Weather app. It's been fairly quiet for the suite of Google Play content apps – but don't be fooled, big changes are coming. A recent Update Wednesday release of Play Movies didn't present any noteworthy or visibly obvious changes; but a look inside revealed a couple of hints about upcoming changes. Just two days later, a brand new release of the Play Store came along to not only fill in some of the gaps, but to add even more interesting bits. That's right, it's a double-header teardown of the Play Store and Play Movies & TV apps. Note: Google announced the first bundle along with extras shortly before this teardown could be published. I chose to include the original text, as it was written, in case it gives some insight into what Google is building. I've also added additional notes to the end of both sections. Don't worry, there's some good stuff after bundles and extras, as well. Disclaimer: Teardowns are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to the launch of a new feature discovered in a teardown. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced. Movie Bundles Every movie streaming service has its own ways to drive sales, usually through discounts or special offers. Since the launch of Play Movies, Google has only ever sold or rented films on an individual basis. Now it looks like Google is preparing to launch "bundles" of movies. The evidence is a bit sparse, but a single string from the Play Store spells out an unmistakable link between movies and bundles. Customers will be able to purchase or pre-order collections of movies put together by Google and its partners. From Movies & TV: <string name="athome_detail_bundle_items_section">In This Bundle</string> From the Play Store: <string name="movie_preordered_through_bundle">"This movie is in a bundle you've pre-ordered"</string> <string name="view_bundle">View Bundle</string> When users open up Movies & TV today, they are presented with a list of recommended titles. Based on code found within the app, it looks like bundles will appear in this stream. As far as presentation, the implementation doesn't seem quite complete in the Movies & TV app, but it's probably only meant to advertise the movies using pre-made banners. The Play Store will continue to handle the actual transactions, reviews, and any other information customers are actually going to look at. Three new layouts in the Play Store give the basic structure of what we can expect to see when Bundles appear: play_bundle_banner_view row 1: 5 preview images row 2: Description Text row 3: "Explore" button + "Install All" button play_bundle_container_view_row row 1: title row 2: creator row 3: description row 4: star rating bar + Install button row 5: progress bar play_bundle_container_view row 1: title row 2: "bulk install button" row 3: "install list" Believe it or not, Google already offers at least one semi-functional Bundle, but it doesn't offer the best buying experience. The Fast and Furious movie franchise is currently available in the Play Store, packaged up as if it were a TV series. For whatever reason, this required chopping up each movie into 3-part segments. Google used a hack to offer a Bundle once. While it's difficult to be certain, it looks like the movies acquired through the new bundles will be treated exactly like regular movies, rather than given totally separate listings. It's important to note, there will be some content that can only be acquired through bundles, but more on that in the next section. Unfortunately, there are no signs to suggest that owning an individual movie will grant any sort of discount on purchasing a bundle that contains it. Not that this sort of thing should be expected, especially since it could be complicated to work out the details, but it would have been nice to see. Naturally, the reason for bundling movies together is usually to offer a package that is cheaper than getting all of the movies individually, but it gets the customer to spend more than it would cost to buy just the movies they enjoy most. This is a good thing for consumers, because it adds another buying choice that might save them a little bit of money. On the other hand, this means we'll eventually be faced with the opportunity to buy the Indiana Jones set with that miserable sequel. Seriously, let's pretend Kingdom of the Crystal Skull never happened. As mentioned above, Google just announced its first bundle is the Star Wars saga. Each movie is priced at $19.99, or the whole bundle can be had for $89.99 (about $30 off). The bundle links to each of the individual movies, mostly confirming there won't be multiple entries for a movie that appears both alone and in a bundle. (This is a workaround some services have used in the past.) I'd like to think the Fast and Furious package above will be replaced with a proper Bundle, but I have a feeling it won't. Extras (a.k.a. Special Features) One great thing about buying movies on physical discs is that they usually come with special features, outtakes, and other footage to go with the film. Strangely, most streaming services are almost universally devoid of extras, choosing instead to include just the primary film. Perhaps this is because of licensing restrictions, additional costs, or maybe it's just harder to present extras to users in a meaningful and intuitive interface. Whatever the reason, hardcore movie fans often stick to physical media just so because they're simply getting more content. Now it looks like Google is ready to change the landscape by adding support for "Extras" in the Movies section. <string name="movie_extras">Extras</string> As far as strings, that's it. Yeah, it's pretty sparse, but there really doesn't need to be anything else. From a close look at the code, it's clear that "Extras" is used simply as a heading above a list of bonus footage. These videos are effectively just like movies, but they won't be sold individually. In fact, the code that flags an Extra is very nearly identical to that of Bundles, including a method called moviesBundleEnabled which confirms that there are multiple movies sold as a package, or just a single movie with bonus content. There are two layouts for representing additional content. The first is named extras_content_list_module, which only shows a title and subtitle. A more extensive version is called extras_item_snippet, which is made up of a single bar with title and duration, and below that is a section for "expanded content" that may contain a longer description, images, or just about anything Google wants to include. As it turns out, Google also tried to include a pretty massive amount of bonus footage in the Fast and Furious hack shown above. The movies are organized in chronological order (yes, Tokyo Drift actually is supposed to be last), and the extras appear below. (Wait, did I just confess to having that much knowledge about this franchise?) Notice, the episode numbers jump from 19 to 101. Much like Bundles, Google is enabling Extras with the new Star Wars collection. Each movie is set up with its own set of Extras, which is certainly better than making them exclusive to the Bundle. These initially show up as just a list of titles and durations, but tapping on any one of them will pop open a still from the video with a description below. Reviews By Critics Reading through user reviews for movies on the Play Store is not entirely unlike trying to spoon-feed your own brain to a paraplegic zombie... This can only end in failure. Actually, let's be brutally honest – user reviews throughout the Play Store only look good when compared to the utterly appalling things people say in YouTube comments. But I digress. It's pretty obvious that user reviews haven't been as helpful as they should be, so Google is working to add reviews by professional movie critics so potential customers don't have to wade through masses of childish and unhelpful comments. This is hardly foreign territory, Google went so far as to buy a company that is dedicated to reviewing restaurants just to integrate that data into Maps. The only new resources related to reviews from critics are the two icons above, both of which only appear in Movies & TV, for now. It's fairly obvious that the critic_avatar image is used for critics, and the account_circle_white image for regular users. Ignore the fact that they have very different dimensions and have completely dissimilar names; what matters is that a single line of code determines which of these two icons is shown, and it makes the decision based on whether a review is from a critic or a regular user. This leads me to believe that the two types of reviews will be found at different spots in the interface. Movies & TV exhibits more progress on this feature than the Play Store, but both of them have significant amounts of new code, particularly classes containing the name CriticReviews. The success of professionally written reviews will largely depend upon how well they are positioned for customers. I haven't seen any clear signs about where they will go, but it's hard to imagine they will be hidden at the very bottom like Google has done with Zagat reviews in the Maps app. No doubt, there will be more to come on this in the future. Rate & Review v2 and Content Filters v2 I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this because, quite frankly, it's boring. Google is testing new versions of interfaces for both the Rate & Review and Content Filters screens in the Play Store. Neither one appears to be significantly different, so I expect this has more to do with code clean-up than anything; but it's possible that we'll see changes in behavior some time in the future. The only possibly distinct change is that the new Rate & Review screen looks like it will be presented as a full-screen display rather than a pop-up dialog. <activity android:label="@string/review_dialog_title" android:name="com.google.android.finsky.activities.RateReviewActivity2" android:theme="@style/RateReviewTheme" android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan|stateUnchanged"/> <activity android:label="" android:name="com.google.android.finsky.activities.PublicReviewsActivity" android:theme="@style/RateReviewTheme" android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan|stateUnchanged"/> new layouts: rate_review_dialog_v2 rate_review_editor_v2 rate_review_editor rate_review_fragment rate_review_v2_blurb rate_review_v2_module <activity android:label="@string/content_filters2_title" android:name="com.google.android.finsky.activities.ContentFiltersActivity2" android:theme="@style/SettingsTheme"/> new layouts: content_filters_activity Pre-Registration For Apps We've all done it. We see an announcement about a great new game only to find out it won't be released for a month. By the time it comes out, we've completely forgotten about it. For things like books and movies, this isn't a problem because we can pre-order these things and they'll magically show up on our devices within minutes of release. Wouldn't it be great if we could do that with apps, too? Well, that's about to happen. A healthy set of new strings in the Play Store apk spells out just what we can look forward to. There won't be pre-orders quite like books, music, or movies. Instead, customers will be able to "pre-register" for apps, which is sort of like opting in. When a developer flips the switch, these customers will receive a notification letting them know the app is available and ready for immediate installation. The process is a little less streamlined than pre-ordering, but that's necessary because apps –unlike other types of content– require more decisions about which devices they should be installed on. <string name="notification_preregistration_released_subtitle">Install Now</string> <string name="notification_preregistration_released_title"><g id="item">%1$s</g> is available!</string> <string name="preregistration_add">Pre-register</string> <string name="preregistration_add_error"><g id="item">%1$s</g> could not be pre-registered</string> <string name="preregistration_coming_soon">Coming Soon</string> <string name="preregistration_dialog_message">"You'll be notified when the app is released. Share the news with your friends!"</string> <string name="preregistration_dialog_positive_button">Got it</string> <string name="preregistration_dialog_supertitle">"You've pre-registered for"</string> <string name="preregistration_extra_label">Coming Soon</string> <string name="preregistration_registered">Registered</string> <string name="preregistration_remove">Unregister</string> <string name="preregistration_remove_error"><g id="item">%1$s</g> could not be removed from pre-registration</string> <string name="share_subject_preregistration">"<g id="document_title">%1$s</g>" is coming soon. Pre-register today.</string> It's a pretty simple system that's really just about keeping customers involved after an initial announcement. It's not clear if this will be available to all developers, or just select partners. Major game studios will be the most obvious beneficiaries. The details will mostly involve business decisions on Google's side, but at least we know it's coming. Wrap-Up I had a busy weekend and Google beat me to breaking the big news about Bundles and Extras. At least, I think that was the biggest news out of this Teardown. Still, there are some good things to look forward to like high-quality reviews for movies and pre-registration for apps. I also have high hopes for Extras because they could really give Play Movies a distinctive edge over competing streaming services and may push all services to offer more content. Now that we've seen new things happening for Movies, I'm optimistic about whatever Books and Music may bring next.

Relax and enjoy some learning. Matthew Fry Note: Google announced the first bundle along with extras shortly before this teardown could be published. I chose to include the original text, as it was written, in case it gives some insight into what Google is building. senor_heisenberg All of that sounds great. Very nice improvements. Now Google just needs to allow bundling of apps. Andy J As the strings listed above for the Playstore specifically say "Install All" I'd suggest app bundling looks likely. row 3: "Explore" button + "Install All" button row 2: "bulk install button" Cody Toombs That section is a bit misleading, sorry. The quoted bits are actually the names Google gave to the UI elements as they refer to them in code, not the text that those elements show. In this instance, the same layout is used across all of the different stores (apps, books, movies, etc.) and the naming convention is probably left over from the days of the Android Market and it only sold apps. Having said that, it's true that there have been whispers about app bundling for ages, just like there has been talk about family discounts and group licensing for individuals (separate from the business licensing bit). I don't doubt that some, or possibly all of these are at least on the list of things Google would like to offer, but I'd be reluctant to expect them in the immediate future. On the other hand, we might be watching Google's keynote next month and get an announcement about all of this stuff. Andy J Yes..... I've been thinking that Google are uncharacteristically quiet at the moment.... I thought we might hear a bit more about the next version of Wear for instance - to take the wind out of the sails of the Apple Launch, but no leaks, no videos, no pictures - nothing. They could be waiting until next month - I guess they have a lot they are working on. Victor L Hope they allow bundle rents as well. Actually, I wish Google would release an All Access/Unlimited service for Movies & TV - THAT would kick butt. Josh Crumley That would be nice, but I'd imagine the licensing issues would be a nightmare for them. Also, if they did, they have newer release movies than things like redbox and netflix, so either it'd be way more expensive than, say, a netflix subscription, or it would be a limited library that excluded certain movies. Victor L You're right, but I'd pay double what I pay for Netflix for new up-to-date movies. If they released TV shows in Brazil (as soon as they come out in the US), heck, I'd triple that.

Matthew Fry "...bit big changes are coming." Cody Toombs Ahh, thanks. Fixed. Joel Purvis One more: the play store version is 5.4.10, not 4.5 Cody Toombs The lesson here is not to write headlines on almost no sleep. Fixed. JG I wonder if they might do the Critics thing similar to the Local Guide format... Offer some incentive reward to write movie reviews for them... Maybe offer a free movie (purchase or just rental) for every 20 reviews... Midnitte Kind of like Google Rewards? Yes please. JG Check out Google's Local Guides program - https://www.google.com/intl/en/local/guides/ They're doing it to get more people to review places to make Google Maps more useful, to compete with Yelp and such. The more reviews you write the higher level you unlock and you pick up a few new goodies at each level. One of the goodies is a special badge for your profile pic. There is a similar badge type thing in the article which made me think of it. Google could do similar with Movies, to encourage more professional level reviews. A free rental would be a good encouragement. Every 20 or so reviews you get a free rental. Maybe be able to trade in so many rental credits to purchase the movie for free instead. Not only would it help encourage people to write more reviews, it'd also get us using Play Movies more, which means the possibility we'll spend more money there. If I get [title] 1 for free, I might be tempted to rent [title] 2 right after to see how it ends...

Graphic but very humorous. Another great teardown, Cody. As usual. Noneya busyiness Region filtering and restrictions should be removed. REkzkaRZ Did anyone else think that a review vaguely hinting at possible upcoming info based on code 'strings' was weird? It's like saying, "they have a 'string' that might handle bass playing in the background while you watch a movie, so maybe all future movies will be able to have additional basslines playing"? OK, maybe I'm reaching -- but I prefer reporting based on *FACT* and not theories based on hopeful future possiblities. That said, my wishlist in Playstore is: - Block a review/reviewer - Pay special attention to some reviewers (ie my peeps!) - 0 star rating option (ie this app is garbage) or "never show me this again" option And I have no idea how to do it, but I'd really love to backrev my Note 3 from Lollipop (with hellish white backgrounds & black text, hellish circles instead of squares, and generally stupid design) with 4.4.2 (they never made 4.4.4 for my phone).

New 'Designed For Families' Google Play Program Will Showcase Kid-Friendly Apps And Games Bertel King, Jr. Follow View All Posts 2015/04/14 9:58am PDTApr 14, 2015 74 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 34 Share on Twitter Total Shares94 Development Google News Google plans to roll out a new Google Play program that places an emphasis on family-focused (i.e. kid-friendly) apps and games. This initiative will display pre-approved content under an experience the company is calling "Designed for Families." The goal is to point parents in the direction of software from the likes of Crayola and PBS Kids without exposing them to the flood of less age-appropriate content on display in the Play Store. Developers are welcome to submit their family-oriented creations to the Designed for Families program. To get in, their content must meet the program's requirements. In a nutshell, this means submitting apps that are rated ESRB Everyone (10+) or equivalent, display kid-friendly ads, and are forthright about sharing information. Google says a team will review the submissions, so it's unclear how long the approval process may take. Eligibility requirements Apps must be rated as ESRB Everyone or Everyone 10+, or equivalent If your Designed for Families app displays ads, you confirm that:2.1 You comply with applicable legal obligations relating to advertising to children.2.2 Ads displayed to child audiences do not involve interest-based advertising or remarketing. 2.3 Ads displayed to child audiences present content that is consistent with the app’s content rating. 2.4 Ads displayed to child audiences follow the Designed for Families ad format requirements. You must accurately disclose the app’s interactive elements on the content rating questionnaire, including:3.1 Users can interact or exchange information3.2 Shares user-provided personal information with third parties 3.3 Shares the user’s physical location with other users Apps that target child audiences may not use Google+ Sign-In or Google Play game services as the login experience for their app. Google hasn't said exactly when it intends for the program to go live, but you can look for the content to appear sometime in the coming weeks.

Old Age people there are two types 1. cool geeky ones 2. peeps that dony use tech AssSmacker Well well well, it's a present surprise to have met you again. :) thanks for being my fan. You haven't even changed your name. Thank you so much. :P And the thing is that peeps who don't use tech don't really open Play Store. :D Schultzter The family program they need is one that recognizes devices are passed around. If my wife buys an app, music, or movie my kids expect to be able to use on my phone when they're out with me. Especially for books, movies and music Google definitely should allow all the devices in my family to be able to play the content. For apps too, but currently in my family that really only applies to the kid's apps. Enrico Sacchetti I think this is what user accounts are for: being able to sign in as someone else on the same device. Schultzter Unfortunately not an option on all the devices in our household. And not always practical either. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Terrible solution. Preben Nielsen You can add your wife's account to your device and use both in the Play Store. Schultzter True. And I could add my account to her devices (which is what I've done to get around this issue for now). But it also means all my other Google stuff shows up on her device, which has resulted in stuff ending up in the wrong place because the wrong account was active. So not really a perfect solution. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Great. Now we just need family SHARING of apps an we'll be all there. sweenish You are able to just add accounts to your devices, but it syncs everything. They have what I want, I just want a better filter. I want my wife to be able to install my apps and vice versa, but we don't want our emails appearing on the other's device. Unchecking those items does nothing, as my account is still visible on her phone's Gmail app. The ability is there, and has been. What we should be asking for is a better filter. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman But adding your account to the device is NOT a reasonable solution, for all the reasons you've said. It's not the smartest or most appropriate way to handle it. And it's bad enough if it's husband and wife, but what about my kids? I shouldn't have to login to MY account on their devices to download apps. The ability isn't actually there. Being able to add in another account and telling it to just not sync your stuff isn't the solution, especially with the amount of manual intervention required. Being able to tie other accounts to your family, let your kids and partner login ONLY as themselves, and then have access to whatever parts of your library you want to share with one another is the way to do it. That also is only reasonable if you have one master account. My girlfriend and I are equals in our relationship. I'm not going to take control of her phone by adding my account to it and tying all my apps to it. And the alternative is me having to put my account on her phone, her account on my phone, both our accounts on my kids' phones, and THEIR accounts on OUR phones if we all want access to all of one another's content. And that doesn't work for Google Play content, because it syncs your bookmarks/saved positions ONLY to the account that owns that content. So if we share a book that way, we'll constantly override each other's bookmarks. My girlfriend and I settled on a shared account from which we try to make our purchases. But if anything syncs based on it, such as those bookmark locations or other settings, we're SOL. It works decently for apps (but only those we explicitly buy on it), but badly for Google Play content. sweenish My account is attached to my wife's phone. That way, she has access to all the apps I've paid for. At no point in time has my account "taken over" anything. Now, I trust her to not root around in emails or calendar or any of my other Google stuff. But it'd be nicer to only allow my app purchases to sync across. With kids and the current functionality, I'd just add my account and give the kids guest access to the games and movies, with sensitive apps like email and whatnot behind a PIN. You make a better argument further down about what syncs and how. At that point, I can agree that just a filter may not be a best all-encompassing solution. The fact still remains that the functionality is there. Because of the simple fact that adding your account does, in fact, share purchases. It just needs a better framework surrounding it. Your second paragraph is just bad. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Odd. Just reread my second paragraph. Still sounds exactly right to me. Either way, the current solution isn't anything resembling an actual solution and needs work. b0b Because, think of the children... Paul Masterson Hell, if it gets my generally non offensive puzzle game in front of more eyeballs, I'm not going to argue. 20 downloads in 2 weeks is a sad state of affairs. Kevin Aaronson Well what's it called? Promote, that shit here man! Stoffers Yay, a new place to find terrible games riddled with IAP. ED-Zが現れた! Let me correct the title for you: "New 'Designed For Families' Google Play Program Will Showcase Kid-Friendly Apps And Games with Kid-Appealing Ads" abhish3k The Ads can be disabled. See Kurama91's comment (below) for proof. Alejandro Loayza Barazorda Just to be clear... Postal isn`t gonna be part of this, right? Kurama91 Just submitted my education app, this is interesting! fdg Isnt the whole Play Store designed for families? Seeing as how Google likes to censor anything it deems inappropriate, I would have thought the whole store was meant for 5 yr olds anyway. gd Great, and when can we have a designed for adults section, where games like Postal can be purchased? play store download It is great Children are an object that was not previously preferred on Google Play, and this update is quite interesting.

By: Rohit Arora Published: Saturday, April 22, 2017, 15:00 [IST] Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are amazing Android smartphones. The new Galaxy devices feature brilliant infinity displays, amazing designs and top-notch hardware. Besides, Samsung has also worked very hard to offer a lag-free Android experience by improving on speed and performance of company's infamous TouchWiz UI. If you already own the latest the Galaxy S8, then you must have noticed that the handset does not feature Samsung's in-house music app. Instead, it comes with Google's Play Music as the default music application. Google on his blog post made the announcement saying, "We have teamed up with Samsung, the world's largest Android smartphone maker, in a partnership to make it even easier and faster for Samsung customers to get the right music no matter where they are or what they're doing." SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tipped to have Dual-Camera setup The blog also reads that with the launch of the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+, Google Play Music will be the default music player and music service on new Samsung phones and tablets globally. Google is also collaborating with Samsung to create special features in Google Play Music for Samsung customers. Moreover, the new Samsung phones and tablets will now come with a free three-month trial of Google Play Music. And with a subscription, you'll get ad-free and on-demand access to Google's library of music, which comprises of more than 40 million songs and thousands of playlists tailored for different occasions. And last but not the least, Samsung users will also get access to YouTube Red, depending upon the region a user is purchasing the handset.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks.

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

This means that due to overuse or high storage, the smartphone doesn’t function as smoothly as it must. In case it gets hanged, it either reboots itself automatically or the user needs to do so. This causes tremendous inconvenience to the user as currently, a smartphone is the solution to a number of needs of an individual. Especially in the case of Android phones, such problems are extremely common. Two renowned phone manufacturers are facing a lawsuit for the same. The Google Huawei lawsuit is in context with the continuous bootloop issues in the Nexus 6P. A few days back, the filing of this lawsuit was under consideration. But now the law firm investigating the case has decided to go forward with it. With reference to the official announcement, there is a class-action lawsuit against Google and Huawei. Information regarding this lawsuit was released by the firm “Chimicles & Tikellis” through a press release. According to this release, the firm alleges Google that tells its users that they must seek warranty coverage from Huawei. On the other hand, Huawei proves to be extremely unhelpful. Not only this, but it also goes to the extent of blocking attempts by users to obtain warranty coverage. The lawsuit may result in monetary compensation for the customers. Who is at fault in the Google Huawei lawsuit? There is accusal on both the companies of breaching warranty terms, conducting fraud, and improperly handling customers. The Google Huawei lawsuit is at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. A number of Nexus 6P smartphones would shut down in an abrupt manner and result in boot cycles. This problem would occur repeatedly and there would be a dismissal of complaints. Google sent the customers to Huawei for warranty recovery whereas Huawei would say that there is a problem with Google’s software. Therefore both the companies are equally at fault. Instead of coming up with a definite solution, the companies simply fooled their customers by playing the blame game. The companies continued selling the faulty Nexus 6P by taking advantage of the fact that the public was oblivious to the issue. As juggling between the two companies was frustrating for the customers, they filed the Google Huawei lawsuit. The main propaganda of the lawsuit is to force both the companies to provide a recall or repair program to rectify the issue. Along with this, they must also provide monetary compensation to those who had to face this inconvenience. The bootlooping complaints are coming up right from September 2016, yet till date, there has been no action. Once the bootloop issue begins in the smartphone, it becomes equivalent to a piece of metal. This is because the smartphone can’t even perform basic functions such as making calls, send text messages, etc. The user is also unable to access any kind of data stored in the phone be it contacts or photos. The frustration of the customers is reasonable and the lawsuit will set an example for other mobile companies.

It’s a day to stop and look at all the things that are potentially destroying the planet and a day to perhaps do what we can to save it. We’ve always looked to technology to help save the Earth and major tech giants have tried to lead the way in that effort. On Earth Day, we take a look at what some of the biggest names in technology are doing to promote a cleaner, safer Earth. Apple Being perhaps the biggest name in the industry today, Apple is trying to be a symbol for clean, green technology. Ahead of Earth Day, the company released its Environment Responsibility Report, which argued for safer, greener technology. Notably, Apple plans to recycle metals bought from suppliers with those taken from old, used products for its iPhones in the future. Apple also highlights that 96 percent of the electricity used at the company’s global facilities came from energy sources like solar, hydro and wind power. The company also said that it uses 99 percent recycled paper for packaging its products. To celebrate Earth Day 2017, Apple launched a video campaign in collaboration with James Blagden that focuses on Apple's work on three key aspects: addressing climate change, conserving precious resources and ensuring safer materials.   Google Google has long tried to celebrate various important dates through Google Doodle and Earth Day 2017 is no different. The Google Doodle for Earth Day this time around is showcasing a story of “a fox who dreams about an Earth that’s been polluted and adversely affected by climate change.” The Earth Day 2017 doodle follows that the Fox wakes up from his dream and starts making small lifestyle changes and this is meant to move everyone to make small changes to their lifestyles. Clicking on the Google doodle open up a page with Earth Day tips to consider do do your part in saving the environment. This includes “supporting critical conservation efforts such as wildlife conservation with World Wildlife Fund, coral reef conservation with The Ocean Agency, and rainforest with The Jane Goodall Institute.“ Google earlier this week also revamped Google Earth, adding new features like 3D toggle, a new Voyager option, the I'm Feeling Lucky dice, and more. After all, Google Earth is one of the more interactive ways to know about the planet, and the update comes just in time for Earth Day 2017. Microsoft Microsoft dedicated the entire week to reflect on where the planet is, where it’s heading, and how the Redmond giant is doing its part towards that greener goal. The company earlier this week noted four Microsoft employees - Prashant Gupta, Karen Chalk, Conor Kelly and Krista Connor - who are tackling environmental changes, in a bid to highlight its efforts in time for Earth Day 2017. The Redmond giant has also partnered with Ecolab to apply cutting-edge technology to tackle the issue of water scarcity. Built on the Azure Cloud, the Water Risk Monetizer (WRM) “is industry’s first publicly available water risk analysis and financial modelling tool that translates water scarcity risks into financial terms, and enables businesses to factor current and future water risks into decision making.” Microsoft is also helping develop smarter energy grids, help achieve optimal harvests, among other things across energy and agriculture. Facebook The massive social media behemoth, Facebook, has also been actively pushing for renewable energy, and joins the likes of Apple and Google in working to achieve the 100 percent renewable energy goal. It is also part of the Open Compute Project, an industry-wide coalition that looks to create energy and cost-efficient infrastructure solutions and share them as open source. Facebook's most recently unveiled data centre, in Clonee, Ireland, is set to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. The company attributes this in part to the availability of wind energy in the country. It puts it on track for achieving its goal of power 50 percent of its infrastructure with clean and renewable energy by the end of 2018. Mobile accessory maker Belkin is also actively taking a part towards a sustainable environment. The company says it has improved the usage of environment friendly materials in building their USB Type-C cables. Their packaging is also made of fully recyclable materials and the company's HQ in Playa Vista is LEED Gold certified for energy efficiency.

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares101 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response?

Play Store v5.10: Support For Books Listed By Series, More Visible App Sizes, And More [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2015/10/16 3:30pm PDTOct 16, 2015 236 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares272 Android OS APK Teardown Applications News Article Contents 1 Book Series 2 App Size With Purchase 3 Miscellaneous 3.1 Onboarding Text 3.2 New Refund Survey 3.3 "Explore" Recommendations 4 APK Download Yesterday brought a brand new update to the Play Store, bringing the version up to 5.10.29. There are some new UI elements, even if most of us aren't allowed to see them yet, and we can now copy text from the what's new and description sections. Naturally, Google included a few hidden tricks and treats just waiting to be discovered. We can expect to see books organized by series, apps described with size, and some friendlier welcome and exploration messages. Disclaimer: Teardowns are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to the launch of a new feature discovered in a teardown. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced. Book Series Products on the Play Store have always been somewhat loosely organized, sticking mostly to simple categories and links to products by the same developers, authors, etc. Slowly but surely, new ways to group items have started to appear. The most notable new feature appeared earlier this year with movie bundles. Books are about to receive a similar treatment as Google Play is about to add support for organizing by series. <string name="rate_this_book_series">Rate this book series</string> <string name="content_description_book_series_title">Book series: <g id="title">%1$s</g></string> <string name="content_description_thumbnail_book_series">Image of book series cover for <g id="item_title">%1$s</g></string> Along with the strings, there is also a new layout named book_series_cluster_module. This will make it a bit easier to track down all of the books that make up a full story. While it might not be that hard to find each book in the Game of Thrones or get caught up with the Hunger Games, this could be very helpful for expansive collections like Terry Pratchett's Discworld or any time where the authors differ from one book to the next. There aren't any hints to suggest we're going to see special discounts on books purchased by series or that we'll even be able to buy them all in a single tap, but these things may be planned for the future. App Size With Purchase If you've got a device with fairly limited free space, the Play Store is going to lend you a hand monitoring your consumption. A few new strings point to much more visible apk sizes to be included with or next to Buy and Install actions. <string name="buy_with_size">Buy <g id="price">%1$s</g> (<g id="appSize">%2$s</g>)</string> <string name="install_with_size">Install (<g id="appSize">%1$s</g>)</string> <string name="no_app_size">Not available</string> The first two strings look like they will include size right on the buttons for purchasing and installing an app. The no_app_size string is probably going to appear in the description where size already appears, but it will probably be used when there are multiple apks for different variants. All three strings are used by code, but I haven't seen them in my own testing. It's possible they only appear with a server-side switch, or they may not be live for anybody yet. This kind of elevated exposure for app sizes could be a good way to remind some users that different apps and games can consume quite a bit of space, and might be encouragement to be a little more aggressive about removing unused apps. This may also go hand-in-hand with the upcoming Uninstall Manager that turned up in the last Play Store teardown. Miscellaneous I'm not inclined to call these special new features; but there are some new strings and images for things we'll see throughout the Play Store today and in the future, and they might be of interest to some curious readers. Onboarding Text We know there is a new onboarding flow that appears with the new navigation design (screenshots included below), but it's not accessible if a server-side switch hasn't been triggered for your account yet. For those that are curious, here is the new text. One thing to note is the large array of variations on the "Discover" text which mentions movies, music, books, and news. The correct string is chosen based on the types of content available in each country. strings <string name="onboard_apps_games_text">A new home for apps &amp; games</string> <string name="onboard_apps_tab">Apps &amp; Games</string> <string name="onboard_center_button_content_description">Get started and continue to the Google Play Store</string> <string name="onboard_center_button_label">Get Started</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_books_magazines">Discover books and news</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_movies_books">Discover movies and books</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_movies_books_magazines">Discover movies, books, and news</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_movies_magazines">Discover movies and news</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_movies_music">Discover movies and music</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_movies_music_books">Discover movies, music, and books</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_movies_music_books_more">Discover movies, music, books, and news</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_movies_music_magazines">Discover movies, music, and news</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_music_books">Discover music and books</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_music_books_magazines">Discover music, books, and news</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_music_magazines">Discover music and news</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_tab">Entertainment</string> <string name="onboard_entertainment_title">Explore Entertainment</string> <string name="onboard_play_text">The store with all things digital—millions of apps &amp; games, and an extensive entertainment catalog</string> <string name="onboard_play_title">Welcome to Google Play</string>    New Refund Survey The Play Store has had a complicated relationship with refunds over the years. While the return window has fluctuated wildly between 48 hours and 15 minutes, it seems to have settled on a fairly reasonable 2 hours. Now Google is going to actually ask some questions to get some context for why returns are really happening. Some new strings show us that refund requests are going to soon ask for reasons why we want our money back. strings <string name="refund_reason_accidental_purchase">I purchased this item by accident</string> <string name="refund_reason_defective">"Item is defective or doesn't work"</string> <string name="refund_reason_fraud">"I don't recognize this purchase"</string> <string name="refund_reason_friendly_fraud">Purchase was made by a friend or family</string> <string name="refund_reason_remorse">I no longer want this item</string> <string name="refund_reason_undelivered">"I purchased but didn't received this item"</string> <string name="refund_survey_comment_hint">Please describe your issue</string> <string name="refund_survey_dialog_title">Tell us about your refund request</string> The options are mostly straight forward and cover the common situations like accidental purchases and an unexpected purchase by a friend or family member – read: "my kid did it." These also cover some interesting scenarios like a purchased item wasn't received, which probably covers expendable digital goods in games. There is even a "remorse" option when you realize it's just not something you actually wanted. It also looks like you can fill in your own reasons if you like. The options also closely match the 'Report a problem' link found in the Play Store purchases page on the web interface. There's no sign that any of these actually lead to different results, but for now they appear to be for simple tracking purposes. Google will probably use the results to better tailor the experience for future purchases. "Explore" Recommendations We've seen various cards in the past that direct our attention to different parts of the store. In this instance, we're going to see some new "Explore" cards coming that will focus on sending people to each of the entertainment sections: Movies, Music, Books, and Newsstand. While this isn't something new, per se, I found one slightly unusual aspect that I haven't seen in the past. The text for each of these guides includes both an "Explore" version and a "You explored" alternative, which suggests the cards will be fairly persistent rather than just disappearing like most cards of this nature do. I'm not sure that there's anything particularly special here, but it's a subtle deviation that caught my attention. strings <string name="content_description_widget_hotseat_explore_books">Explore Books on Google Play</string> <string name="content_description_widget_hotseat_explore_movies">Explore Movies &amp; TV on Google Play</string> <string name="content_description_widget_hotseat_explore_music">Explore Music on Google Play</string> <string name="content_description_widget_hotseat_explore_newsstand">Explore Newsstand on Google Play</string> <string name="content_description_widget_hotseat_explored_books">You explored Books on Google Play</string> <string name="content_description_widget_hotseat_explored_movies">You explored Movies &amp; TV on Google Play</string> <string name="content_description_widget_hotseat_explored_music">You explored Music on Google Play</string> <string name="content_description_widget_hotseat_explored_newsstand">You explored Newsstand on Google Play</string> In case anybody missed it yesterday, here's the download link.

Francesco Lorenzet the all new graphics shown in google plus are not there yet? CoreRooted Nope. Ben Godfrey They have to flip a server-side switch for us to get it, unfortunately. Installing the new APK just yields the new icon and the copy/paste of descriptions functionality. Cody Toombs There are also a couple of minor animation changes, but nothing I would consider particularly worthy of calling out. saf1927 Wait, a new icon? I still have the usual one. Mason I think he means the new Google logo. AFAIK the icon hasn't changed. Ben Godfrey Yes, that's what I meant. The icon is the same. :) Armand Agopian (Armdev) I really hope at least the Play Store Dev Team will release these features after it is tested thoroughly. I don't want another unfinished UI like Hangouts, YouTube, and Google+ (I'm looking at you, vertical navigation popout menu, we know you're not a drawer). fcjan Well new design is out, so we will see Shirley Daugherty Excellent job for all of you to make $5000 to $8000 every month....It's easy you just have a internet connection and a p.c to earn money…. ======>>>>>Visit my account for more information 256864 NickAllures It is snappier than before, that is for sure. Jay Hopefully they can extend the categorization to the comics section too. That place is a mess. J Have they removed the 'People' section yet? Kamran Mackey No. And what's wrong with the People section? psydex Uh... Using APK in OP, beside the (badly rendered) Google Play logo in the search field - mine looks pretty much the same!? F4uzan It's a server side change, it hasn't arrived on mine too (surprisingly) guy No word about RTL support? Kurtis Whittington I still want them to _LIST_ IAPs on each app's page. Even just tap on the "Contains In-App Payments" thing and pop a window up with listed examples if it changes often. Seriously. I don't mind reasonable "Buy Chapter 2" or "Remove Ads" payments. Even the "Buy the Dev a Beer" payments are fine to me. I just want to make sure they aren't nickel and dime-ing me before I even bother to install the app and spend time and energy to set up things. Simple Apps I'd love to see a sort option so i can sort by newest released or updated, a released this week section might be nice as well so i can see all apps released in the last seven days as the store is rubbish for promoting new apps unless they get a million installs in the first 20 minutes of release.... Mohamed Elsaied You install the application was everything, but nothing has changed Is this version for Android Marschmilo or what ?? I hope to find a response Kamran Mackey No, it's not for Android Marshmallow. And learn to spell please. AnthonyRyan89 Yay!! Installed the new Play Services and it brought back the New UI for Play Store. play store download I hope the new features of the Google Play development team will be user-friendly, user-friendly and easy to use.

Reuters PayPal has been setting up agreements with banks, credit card issuers and wireless carriers to convert PayPal from a payments button on websites into a versatile financial tool used to make payments in stores, transfer money overseas and shop from smartphones on the go. By Bloomberg News Apr 18, 2017 at 3:40 pm | Print View PayPal and Alphabet’s Google deepened their relationship with a new agreement that enables payments through the tap of a phone from PayPal accounts at thousands of new retail locations. The partnership lets PayPal users link their accounts to Android Pay, Google’s digital wallet, on smartphones running most versions of the Android operating system. This makes PayPal a funding option when people use Android Pay in locations including Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstores and Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants. PayPal was added as a payment method for Google’s Play app and digital content store almost three years ago. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has been busy cutting deals with banks, credit card issuers and wireless carriers to convert PayPal from a payments button on websites into a versatile financial tool used to make payments in stores, transfer money overseas and shop from smartphones on the go. The Android Pay deal increases PayPal’s reach in stores, which Schulman sees as key to getting customers to use PayPal more frequently than the current average of two to three transactions per month. “This is the next logical step in our desire to partner with everyone in the ecosystem,” said Aunkur Arya, senior vice president at PayPal unit Braintree, which enabled the Android Pay tie-up. “These partnerships don’t happen unless there’s value for both sides.” One big challenge remains — PayPal accounts can’t link to Apple Inc.’s digital wallet, Apple Pay. The stronger relationship between Google and PayPal could rekindle speculation about an acquisition. PayPal split from parent company eBay Inc. two years ago, prompting hope it could be a target of tech companies or financial institutions looking to enter the digital payments industry. PayPal processed $354 billion in payments through 197 million active customers in 2016. Like what you're reading?

It’s not just an internet problem. It is a humanity problem Sat, Apr 22, 2017, 06:00 Jennifer O'Connell Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg: the media was unimpressed by Zuckerberg’s promise to do better regarding live-streaming of attacks. Photograph: AP Photo/Noah Berger         A visibly uncomfortable Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage at the Facebook developer conference in San Jose last Tuesday, his eyes darting in the direction of the autocues placed around the stage. “We have a lot more to do here. And we’re reminded of this this week by the tragedy in Cleveland,” he said, addressing the shooting dead of Robert Godwin Snr by gunman Steve Stephens, who posted a video of the killing on Facebook, and live-streamed himself talking about it. The videos stayed up for nearly three hours before they were removed, raising questions – yet again – about Facebook’s ability to moderate content, particularly active crimes. “We’ll do all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening,” Zuckerberg continued in the same stilted fashion, before jumping off to a topic with which he clearly felt a lot more comfortable: augmented reality. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg: the media was unimpressed by Zuckerberg’s promise to do better regarding live-streaming of attacks. Photograph: AP Photo/Noah Berger The media was unimpressed by Zuckerberg’s promise to do better: CNN called it a “cursory mention” of the tragedy, while Fortune described it as “another example of live video’s dark side”. It is tempting to cast all of the blame for this at Facebook’s door. By offering Stephens – who died by suicide after a three-day manhunt – an audience, the social media site arguably contributed to the conditions for the assault. And now, instead of taking steps to improve moderation, it is clinging to its increasingly utopian-sounding narrative about connecting people. Humanity’s instinct But Facebook did not create humanity’s instinct for depravity: it merely gave it a platform. At the time of writing, Google’s YouTube was continuing to give it a platform – multiple copies of the video could be viewed there, prefaced by warnings of “potentially inappropriate” content. By mid-week, those videos had amassed over 1.03 million views. Steve Stephens posted a video of himself killing Robert Godwin Snr, and live-streamed himself talking about it. Photograph: The New York Times Clearly, this isn’t just a Facebook problem. It’s not just a Google problem, or an Internet problem. It is a humanity problem.  Facebook Live beating: Victim’s parents got texts amid incident Three for court in Sweden over Facebook Live ‘gang-rape’ Two journalists killed during Facebook Live transmission in Dominican Republic What those rising video view counts reflect is the same base instinct that led to people in Tudor times gathering in public squares to watch executions – only now they can watch from the comfort of their phone. Where people in the medieval era would have jeered and thrown things, today they click and share and retweet. We should hardly be surprised that streaming tools have ended up being used to turn violence into a spectator sport, the grisliest kind of performance art. As a species, we’re a depraved bunch, with a deeply rooted fascination with gore and violence. Package those instincts up with a generation’s hunger for self-expression, and a set of tools that promises instant celebrity to anyone with a mobile phone and a willingness to do or say something extreme, and the results will be ugly. Facebook Live is just a year old, and already it has been host to live-streamed beatings, gang rapes in Chicago and Sweden, and multiple suicides. Performance What is perhaps most shocking about all of these incidents is how detached from reality they all seem, even to those actually taking part – as though it is in fact a performance. In one incident in January, four young people in Chicago broadcast a 30-minute assault on a disabled 18 year old. The 24-year-old woman filming the assault blithely checks her hair. At one point, she berates her followers, “You all ain’t even commenting on my shit. Ain’t nobody watching my shit.” Last month, teenage boys in Chicago live-streamed the sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl, as more than 40 people watched. Not one called 911. In another incident that predated Facebook Live, an Ohio woman was jailed for nine months for live-streaming the rape of her unconscious friend on Periscope. The prosecutor said she began recording to force the rapist to stop, but “she got taken up with all the likes that her live-stream was getting, and therefore . . . did nothing to aid the victim”. “Technology has moved us into an area that is sometimes beyond belief,” prosecutor Ron O’Brien said. Allure of an audience But it is not the tools themselves that egg people on to violence: it is the allure of an audience. In that sense, every click and every share is an act of depravity. We can kid ourselves that we’re looking merely to participate in the sense of outrage; in reality, we’re feeding the act itself. Pennsylvania State Police investigate the scene where Steve Stephens, the suspect in the killing of a Cleveland retiree posted on Facebook, took his own life. Photograph: Greg Wohlford Ultimately, viewing a live video of a crime and choosing not to report it may become a crime itself, in line with sending or receiving images of child pornography. Until then, we can only hope that basic humanity takes hold. Based on recent experience, that seems a futile hope. Last week, Ryan A Godwin – grandson of Robert – tweeted in apparent disgust: “Please please please stop retweeting that video and report anyone who has posted it! That is my grandfather show some respect #Cleveland.” A day later, he seemed to have given up hope that people would stop looking. “If you guys are going to exploit my grandfather’s legacy for some retweets at least honor him by getting his name right GOD-WIN not Goodwin.”       Topics: Mark Zuckerberg Steve Stephens Robert Godwin Snr Jennifer O'connell Facebook YouTube Google United States Sweden  Subscribe.   Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares88 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Syukri Lajin Google doesn't backup call history and sms. that's the only shitty part i have to complain about. JohnyNoLegs It does do SMS 100% as i just restored from a reset. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Killa Can you head into your Google Drive and look at the Backups for your Pixel? Is each content type separated out...like text, call history, etc.? Impulse_Vigil I'm not seeing it on the mobile app, dunno if it's visible on desktop or the site, or if they just hide it somehow... The settings page does say Drive tho, it's kinda weird. Not even sure whether they're counting this towards one's Google account storage or what. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Chang Hi, I posted this, but it got kicked to bottom of thread. So, here it is again. Hope it is some help. Gen. Chang • 43 minutes ago Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Xchris Big deal. Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, that's one of you so far. Impulse_Vigil You polled Pixel users huh? abc "The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites" That's just sad for Android then. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7. Hexlattice On slower internet speeds, Photos has a really hard time trying to backup larger files... Normally, getting on a faster network will fix the problem, but if the files are old enough, it's like Photos gives up on trying and I end up having some videos never backup :( abc Pixel problems? https://i.imgflip.com/h8wog.jpg?a414600 Gen.

Praneeth Kancherla They have been looking into it from past few months. Backups on my Pixel XL never worked. I've contacted support through chat option on the phone and all information I got at the end is Google is aware of this issue,actively working on fixing it and fix will be available soon. It looks meaning of soon is certainly different​ in Google's dictionary. Lately my phone has developed so much lag even while doing simple tasks like using keyboard in any app, browsing internet and settings. Google support is okay to replace my device after verifying warranty but cannot ship replacement first even if I'm okay with hold on my credit card for full amount and covering shipping charges. They say replacement may take anytime from 7-10 business days and I need to buy another phone. The reason they quote is I'm not the original buyer. But they were able to verify and confirm that it's​ still under warranty. They are okay with honoring the warranty but not willing to ship replacement first even if I'm okay with covering charges that may incur in doing that. All these issues for $750 smartphone and they taking months to resolve issues without any possible workaround is just terrible in my opinion. I'll still use Pixel and Android as I like them compared to Apple and its ecosystem but I feel Google is certainly not doing enough to retain consumers like me.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Windows 10 Cloud hardware specs leak By Martin Brinkmann on April 22, 2017 in Windows - Last Update:April 22, 2017 8 Microsoft's not-yet-officially unveiled -- Windows 10 Cloud operating system is likely going to be unveiled on Microsoft's May 2, 2017 event in New York City. While we will have to wait another week to find out whether that is indeed the case or not, Windows 10 Cloud hardware specs and performance targets were leaked online recently on Windows Central. Windows 10 Cloud, according to rumors, is Microsoft's answer to Google's Chromebook. Designed specifically to compete with Google in education, rumors have it that it will be a low-cost device that will run well on hardware that regular versions of Windows 10 don't run that well on. Read: our first impression of Windows 10 Cloud Windows 10 Cloud hardware specs Microsoft's performance targets for Chromebook competitor highlight what the company wants manufacturers to deliver. It wants its Windows 10 Cloud devices to compete on an eye to eye level with Chromebook's battery life, and resume, and come close to the cold boot, first-sign in and consecutive sign-in times of devices powered by Google's Chrome OS. As far as minimum hardware specs are concerned, they hold some surprises considering that Microsoft needs to compete with Google in performance and price: Quad-core (Celeron or better) CPU. 4 Gigabytes of RAM. 32 Gigabytes of storage for 32-bit, 64 Gigabytes for 64-bit. Battery larger than 40 WHr (WattHour). Fast eMMC or SSD storage. Optional pen and touch support. How does this compare to regular versions of Windows 10? Processor with at least 1 GHz 1 Gigabyte of RAM for 32-bit, 2 Gigabytes for 64-bit. 16 Gigabytes of hard drive space for 32-bit, 32 Gigabytes for 64-bit versions of Windows 10. A DirectX 9 or higher compatible graphics card with WDDM 1.0 drivers. A 800x600 display. And Google's Chrome OS? Google does not list minimum requirements for its Chrome operating system.  If you check out the devices that are available currently, you will notice the following minimum specs: Intel Celeron processor or comparable. 2 Gigabytes of RAM. 16 Gigabyte of SSD storage It is interesting to note that Microsoft's Windows 10 Cloud operating system requires better hardware than Windows 10 in some areas. Most notable RAM and storage. On the processor side, Windows 10 will run on ARM processors eventually as well which should boost battery life and reduce the cost of devices. Windows 10 Cloud may look an awful lot like Windows RT on first glance. Microsoft launched Windows RT alongside Windows 8, but has not really mentioned the operating system since the launch of Windows RT 8.1. The company's is still pushing out patches for Windows RT, but that is about it. One of the points of criticism in regards to Windows RT was that users could only use the apps that shipped with the operating system, Internet services and apps, and what was available in Windows Store at the time. This is similar to how Windows 10 Cloud operates, but with two notable differences. The Windows Store has matured a lot, and UWP applications deliver a better user experience on average. This includes options to run legacy Windows programs that were converted to run as Windows 10 apps. (hacks may circumvent that restriction) Windows 10 Cloud comes with an option to upgrade the operating system to a Windows 10 Home or Pro license. Closing Words Microsoft wants to establish a Chromebook competitor, especially in the US, a market where Google has been conquering the Education sector with its low-cost Chrome OS powered devices. It remains to be seen how well this is going to work out for Microsoft. While Windows 10 Cloud looks to be better in all aspects than Windows RT, price, battery life and functionality will determine whether the operating system will have a chance to break Google's domination in the niche. Now You: Will Microsoft's Windows 10 Cloud do better than Windows RT? Summary Article Name Windows 10 Cloud hardware specs leak Description Windows 10 Cloud has not been unveiled officially yet by Microsoft, but the minimum hardware specs and performance targets of Microsoft's Chrome OS competitor have leaked online already.

I never understood how do people end up buying these pitiful machines, barely able to run a crippled OS. I guess it's pure marketing b/s. And they're not cheap either, unless they cost 100EUR at most (which I already consider being about 20EUR more than they worth). If budget is an issue, for about 200EUR you can buy a proper laptop with an i3, 4GB of RAM, a 500GB HDD and an i/o configuration that puts to shame.. I wanted to say a MacBook but evertyhing on the market puts MacBooks to shame in the i/o department. Reply Sean April 22, 2017 at 12:36 pm # I've had a HP14 chromebook for a few years now and have been very happy with it. Everything I do is in the web, I use google drive and don't need to store any files. The OS is very responsive and the trackpad gestures make it hard to go back to Windows. Reply LD April 22, 2017 at 12:30 pm # The cost of ownership and operating costs will be much higher with Microsoft. Schools be wary. W10/Bing/Edge/Windows Store versus Chrome/Google/Android apps/Google Store. Pick the winner. Reply chesscanoe April 22, 2017 at 2:12 pm # The head in the cloud approach has been advocated by some for decades. Even the current desktop Skype is trying to move in this direction. Under Windows 10 CU and current desktop Skype as an example, if you go to Help - Check for Updates, you are offered to try Skype for Windows 10. Eye candy approach is not useful when trying to read an IM in a font size that cannot be changed in Settings. The provided solution is to use Magnifier, Going to a cloud application seems to imply limited function, and accessibility problems are not considered in the implementation. Reply Jack Smith April 22, 2017 at 2:44 pm # Groundhog day? Think we have been here before and we will get the same result. Gains zero traction against Chromebooks. So many issues but a big one is the inefficiency of the Windows kernel as explained by their own developers. http://blog.zorinaq.com/i-contribute-to-the-windows-kernel-we-are-slower-than-other-oper/ Reply Question April 22, 2017 at 5:26 pm # How does a Chromebook or Win10 Cloud function without internet access ? Still almost useless or did any improvements happen ? Another question: can I use a VPN with it or not ? Reply Coriy April 22, 2017 at 8:58 pm # And then there are the privacy concerns... Considering how much data the regular versions of Windows 10 collect, won't the Cloud do that as well? Or perhaps more? I'm not sure that will sit well with parents, teachers and students. And yes, I know that the Chromebooks do it too, but can be reined in by sysadmins. Reply Ingenou April 23, 2017 at 7:43 am # If Microsoft, Facebook and Google are serious about trusting them, Microsoft and Facebook need to transfer their microsoft.com and facebook.com mail hosting respectively to Google Apps for Work, likewise Google need to transfer their gmail.com mail hosting to Office 365, then the public will believe their assertions of respect for data privacy.

The special partnership will also include integrations with Samsung's AI assistant Bixby when it launches, which will work like the Assistant integration on Google Home. Samsung has long struggled with what role it plays in the software and services world and has long been dependent on Google for software services, on and off making competing products of its own like Milk and S Health, now Samsung Health (which replicates much of what Google Fit does). The partnership is important for Google as Google Play Music will now be the default music player and service on all new Samsung phones and tablets globally. Samsung users will also get special Play Music features as part of the partnership. Samsung users can upload and stream up to 100,000 of their own songs to Play Music for free, double of what non-Samsung Play users are allowed. New Samsung phones and tablets will also come with a free three-month trial of the service, which includes a free trial to YouTube Red. Samsung's basic Music player app isn't going away; it'll still be on the company's phones (for now), though Play Music will be the default.   0 0 Samsung and Google Play music announce their musical friendship was posted in Sci-Tech of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on April 22, 2017 and was last updated on April 22, 2017.

Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies.  The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet Inc.'s Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple's private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn't respond to requests for comment.  With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications.  In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing Co. detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal.  At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.  "It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation," Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025.  A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook Inc. is to connect billions of people who don't have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. "You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren't inhibited by the hard knocks of the past," said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra Inc. Still, TMF's Farrar said there's no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its "internet from the sky" plan more than a decade ago.  Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It's already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries LLC, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela's new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It's internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet's Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple's augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet's Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs Inc., a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb Ltd., and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX.  Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. -- With assistance from Alex Webb, Julie Johnsson and Ashlee Vance To contact the authors of this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net, Mark Bergen in San Francisco at mbergen10@bloomberg.net.

I was stunned when I first learned that Google was reorganizing itself with the new corporate name Alphabet that would serve as a holding company of sorts for all of Google’s separate businesses, including Google itself. But the more I thought about the arrangement, the more I realized that it actually makes some sense. The new Alphabet will have current CEO Larry Page as its CEO, with Google co-founder Sergey Brin as president and Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt playing the same role in the new corporation. Google itself will continue to exist as one of the many companies under the Alphabet umbrella. The CEO of the new, slightly smaller Google will be run by Sundar Pichai, who currently runs Google’s main products including search, Android and Gmail, but will now also have the head of YouTube reporting to him. Other companies under the Alphabet umbrella will include Nest, the maker of the smart thermostat and other Internet-connected devices that Google acquired last year. Calico, which focuses on longevity, will also be in the fold, along with numerous other current Google projects including Google Glass, self-driving cars and a contact lens that can detect blood glucose levels. Stockholders may appreciate that the new Alphabet will separately report financial information for each of its companies, which may make it easier for financial analysts and investors to better understand how each of the many parts of Google is performing. It’s also a way to formally recognize that there are projects under the new company that are, as Larry Page sometimes calls them, “Moon shots,” which may or may not ever see the light of day but remain worth pursuing. The move didn’t placate Consumer Watchdog, a Santa Monica-based nonprofit that has, for several years, been complaining that Google violates user privacy, among other alleged sins. “A rose by any other name is still a rose and Google by any other name is still the Internet giant,” said John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog’s Privacy Project director. He added that, “Alphabet through what will now be called its subsidiary will continue to track us around the Web and build digital dossiers about us. It makes little difference to Google’s users.” Whether or not you agree with Simpson’s criticism of Google, he is correct that renaming the corporation won’t have a huge immediate impact on consumers, though there are some that say that the new organization will be more nimble and more entrepreneurial, which could eventually trickle down to average Google users. Personally, I’m all for the deal if it keeps the company that will soon no longer be called Google as an innovator willing to make very big and risky bets. Back in 1998, when Google launched, search was a big bet and it was also a pretty big bet when Google launched Gmail and when it acquired Android. Yes, big bets can lead to giant losses but they can also lead to revolutionary enhancements and I’m hoping to see at least a few of those from the new Alphabet.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Touring the globe — from your office cubicle ; | • Google Earth’s newly unveiled Voyager tool aims to feed our urge to travel print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 3040959 false Google has launched Voyager — a “showcase of interactive tours” meant to enhance the latest version of Google Earth. The “interactive tours” allow users to explore parts unknown — without leaving their cubicles. (Google via The New York Times) Click here to enlarge image Touring the globe — from your office cubicle Google Earth’s newly unveiled Voyager tool aims to feed our urge to travel By Matt Stevens / New York Times News Service Published Apr 22, 2017 at 12:02AM Google has launched a cool new internet thing. And be warned: Your productivity may be about to take a tumble. Assuming you don’t mind descending down a rabbit hole, you may want to check out Voyager — a “showcase of interactive tours” meant to enhance the latest version of Google Earth. Voyager, which was introduced Tuesday, allows Earth’s bored employees to feed their wanderlust and pretend they are somewhere — anywhere — other than the office cubicle they are actually sitting in. Say you’ve never been to Paris. Voyager pairs the view provided by its maps with a still image and a so-called knowledge card to let users hop around the city as though they were on a packed three-day vacation. Similar tours of “Hemingway’s Hangouts,” Frank Gehry buildings and museums around the world are also available. Want a less urban experience? Jane Goodall will take you on a tour of a Tanzanian park and tell you about her team’s chimpanzee research. You can even explore Afghanistan with Zari, a 6-year-old Muppet character who hails from the country. Zari loves to read and study — a fortunate trait because, as a knowledge card tells us, “Afghanistan is home to one of the largest populations of young people in the world, but their education system is struggling.” In a telephone interview Thursday, Rebecca Moore, director of Google Earth, called stories and storytelling the “linchpin” of the new Google Earth and said that Voyager would allow more people to tell such stories in more timely and compelling ways. “What you’re never going to find in Voyager is, ‘Here’s a tour of homes of celebrities,’” Moore said. “What we want to do is inspire people to explore the world through this interactive educational experience. We see it as a way to bridge cultures.” For more than a decade, Google Earth has allowed users to see the places they plan to visit before they actually do — or to revisit places they once knew. But as Google Earth became more ubiquitous, people found other ways to leverage it. Virtual flights over land and sea with Google Earth, it turned out, were an excellent way to learn about places, Moore said. “In an ad hoc, kind of grass-roots manner, people were using it to tell stories,” she said. “What we realized is we wanted to take it to the next level.” The latest update took two years to create, Gopal Shah, a Google Earth project manager, said in a blog post. Moore called it “our gift to the world,” noting that the tool is “not commercialized” in any way. Melissa Parrish, a research director at Forrester, a technology and marketing research firm, said that Google sometimes does create projects “just because they can.” But she said a company does not become as successful as the tech giant “without thinking about the monetization possibilities of everything they do.” Google may choose not to place ads directly on Google Earth or Voyager, Parrish said, but she added that every time a user clicks around the world, Google could presumably gather data it can use to target consumers elsewhere on the web. “They’re Google,” Parrish said. “If there’s one thing they’re incredible at, it’s making money.” Voyager is among a number of new features within the revamped Google Earth. There are dozens of virtual trips currently available — including one through New York City — and Moore promised more to come. In the latest version of Google Earth, an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button also emerges, allowing users to stumble upon random locations with a single click. (Kings Island amusement park in Mason, Ohio, anyone?) A new 3-D button lets you see “any place from any angle” and share a “postcard” of the view, Shah said in the blog post. Eventually, Moore said, Google plans to create a set of easy-to-use storytelling tools that will allow anyone to create tours similar to those in Voyager. “This is a time when the world is getting factionalized,” she said. “And we need things to bring us together. We see Google Earth as making the world a smaller place — in a good way.” And you thought finding your old house was fun. 17052986 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Even Google’s Wi-Fi router still sucks Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 19th, 2017 at 3:50 PM Share Tweet It seems to be an immutable fact that all Wi-Fi routers are doomed to be bad. In fairness, we do ask a lot of them: sit in a cupboard, never move, and don’t you dare take one five-minute break per year or I’ll run in there are reboot you faster than you can say WPA. So it shouldn’t be surprising that Google’s own Wi-Fi routers have their own set of problems. But even by the low standards of Wi-Fi routers, Google’s problems sound bad. Don't Miss: The best thing about Samsung’s new Galaxy S8, aside from the design Ever since a recent update, Google Wifi users have been complaining on Google’s forums of constant drops in connectivity. Google has acknowledged the problem and suggested a temporary fix, but it’s not simple: disconnect any Windows 10 or Xbox devices from your Wi-Fi network, and things should work as normal. This is obviously a problem if you’re the kind of person who enjoys using your laptop on the internet from time to time. This isn’t even the first time that Google’s routers have run into serious problems. Earlier this year, Google accidentally reset a bunch of routers to factory defaults, which required users to hard-reset the devices and set them up again from scratch. Google seems to be facing these problems because it’s the first company to ship a Wi-Fi router that relies so heavily on the internet and cloud services to function. You have to log in with a Google account to set up Wi-Fi, and updates are installed automatically. It’s great for security, but leaves your home Wi-Fi reliant on a cloud system to not make mistakes. Sadly, that doesn’t seem to have worked so far.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Society Human Rights Earth Day 2017: Why is it observed, what is the theme this year and how is Google creating awareness? This year's Earth day campaign is dedicated to an ambitious goal – to achieve global climate and environmental literacy within three years. Sriparna Ghosh April 22, 2017 12:19 IST Pixabay Every year, April 22 is observed as Earth Day as a mark of acknowledgement of the only planet that supports life. The day also serves as a reminder to create awareness about the environmental issues that are taking a toll on it.  Earth Day: Google Doodle reminds us all of the beauty of the planet The Earth has a lot to offer — oxygen, fresh water, ozone layer, suitable climate, vegetation, minerals — that make life on the planet possible, but greed-driven ways of life have led to massive exploitation of these resources, most of which are unreplenishable in nature. This in turn has led to multiple problems that sometimes threaten our existence. Hence, every year Earth Day is observed to make human beings realise their responsibility towards planet Earth.  While the idea of an Earth Day was first conceived by activist John McConnell at a Unesco conference in 1969, it was formally started by Gaylord Anton Nelson, a senator from Wisconsin who was worried about the adverse effects of industrialisation on the environment. It was made into an international day in 1990 and is now celebrated by more 193 countries every year. This year's campaign is dedicated to an ambitious goal – to achieve global climate and environmental literacy in three years, by Earth Day 2020— its 50th anniversary. How is Google honouring it? The search engine has commemorated the 47th anniversary of Earth Day in a unique way; using a series of illustrations, the Google doodle tells the story of a sleeping fox that has a nightmare about the consequences of climate change. It dreams of dead plants and animals in the sea, of how the polar caps are melting and killing the penguins who are staring at a habitat crisis. The disturbed fox wakes up and reaches out to two other friends — a cat and a frog, to spread the message of conserving the Earth.

Roboworkers Associated Press file photo A sushi robot works at the stand of the Japanese company Hitachi last month in one of the exhibition halls of the IT trade fair CeBIT in Hanover, Germany. Sadhna Jayatunge argues one purpose of basic income is to offset the growing number of jobs lost to technology. next play/pause pre Hamilton Spectator By Sadhna Jayatunge Tank, the roboceptionist, greeted my family and me when we visited Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh, Penn. during March break. In Hamilton, not once have I received a greeting from a robot. It was fascinating to compare two steel towns; Pittsburgh and Hamilton both struggled due to the decline of manufacturing economies. Today, Pittsburgh boasts of its future as a brighter technology-centric economy surrounded by Robotics Institute, Apple, and Google. The city partnered with Uber and piloted a driverless car initiative in 2016. Nevertheless, Mayor Bill Peduto is facing backlash as unions are protesting the displacement of workers. In Hamilton, the city's economic diversifying efforts contributed to weathering the recession and thankfully we have not yet seen robots competing for our jobs to that extent. However, we need to act toward a solution because cheap and smart robots are outcompeting humans for jobs. Globally, in both industrial and commercial settings, automation is increasing rapidly. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated world class chess champion Garry Kasparov; by 2020 driverless cars will be on the road by Tesla, Google, Ford, and 16 other large companies. John McCarthy, the computer scientist who believed machines could be simulated to learn, coined the term "artificial intelligence" (AI) in 1955. Look how far we have come. Advances in AI are automating not only blue-collar, but white-collar jobs as well. Robots are being built worldwide for disaster response, construction, agriculture, health care, residential care, judicial work, and journalism. That's not all, AIs are into art too; composing music and painting. According to Philippe Chabot, basic income activist, within eight hours a robot can produce 2,400 shoes, whereas it would take 200 humans to do the same task. Boston Dynamics/Google, MIT, and Japanese telecom Softbank have all built revolutionary robots; Baxter, Atlas, Spot, Cheetah, Pepper, and ASIMO will replace many human jobs. In the future, robots will walk and talk like humans, without demanding a living wage, costing less than minimum wage to employ. We are living in the midst of a grand transition in the economy, and according to a Brookfield Institute (2016) study; 42 per cent of the Canadian labour force is occupying jobs which are at risk of being lost to technology within the next decade or two. Recently Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his commitment to funding $125-million toward leveraging AI's economic potential. Technological advances have raised human living standards beyond expectations yet social inequities, political stresses, and reckless use of technology have degraded humanity. Ideally, we would trap this technology beast, rethink its impact on humanity then proceed with a controlled release. However, these efforts will be useless as the beast is enormous. Also, proponents argue AI has the capability to increase human's wealth. Within our control is establishing policies to manage adverse effects to people. Economies should serve people; therefore, a closer look at social and ethical issues should be made a high priority locally, nationally and globally. Paid work is becoming a less reliable source of income for many. Therefore, basic income may be a measure to ensure people have a steady stream of income. It is also important to have policies to create new types of human work as studies have shown that there are deep links between unemployment and unhappiness; unemployment or volunteering cannot compare with leisure. So what is basic income? It is a no-strings attached stream of income that is sufficient for a person to meet basic necessities (food, water, shelter, and clothing) and enable them to live above the poverty line. It does not prevent additional income, including employment. The idea of basic income owes to 18th-century radical Thomas Paine who proposed 15 pounds to 21-year-olds funded through land taxes. Paine wanted to support people who weren't able to work or survive with their earnings. In 1962, Milton Friedman, a libertarian economist, supported a safety net a guaranteed income. Later Martin Luther King Jr, Richard Nixon, and George McGovern also advocated. In the absence of work people can engage in volunteering to fulfil their need to be productive members of society if a reliable source of income was in place. Canadians are known for dedicated volunteering. According to Statistics Canada 13.3-million people, almost half of the population — aged 15 and over — volunteered in 2010. Despite the need, basic income raises concerns; primarily funding and side effects. Charles Murray, in his 2006 book "In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace The Welfare State" proposed eliminating social security and medicare for such funding. Bill Gates proposed a tax on robots to make up for the lost tax from displaced workers. Other ways include savings made on health care. I have followed the Universal Basic Income campaign since 2015 and convinced of its potential to protect dignity of displaced workers. There is an urgency to tackle the issue of precarious work and give dignity back to the worker. Of the many ways proposed to fund the program, implementing a tax on robots is my preferred choice. Sadhna Jayatunge lives in Hamilton and is involved in a variety of diversity, multicultural and education communities and programs. | (1) Comments By Jim | APRIL 22, 2017 09:04 AM Within 4 years we'll have driverless cars. Within 20 we'll see the end of work. Therefore, Hamilton is building a train that will be completed in 2024 that we can all ride to our jobs?

Through beautiful illustration, which seems right out of a children’s graphic novel, Doodler Sophie Diao narrated the story of a fox dreaming about the polluted earth and how with the help of his friends try to make amends. “The fox wakes with a startle, and urgently starts making small lifestyle changes to care for the Earth. Along the way, the fox enlists friends – including Momo the cat, and Google Weather’s favourite frog – to join its quest to protect and nurture the environment,” the Google blog read. The smallest changes could make big differences, that’s what the fox says. #GoogleDoodle #EarthDay pic.twitter.com/IxUqrlTQth — Google India (@GoogleIndia) April 22, 2017 The trio takes up many tasks like that of the planting of saplings, choosing to eat vegetables instead of meat, carpooling, unplugging of unused electronic gadgets among other things.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year.

Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½. I've been on Wi-Fi most of the day and location has been turned off. Rest of the settings are stock out of the box. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d6d107fe72843084747728a2ff7d6ed0c69dbb8828498d680a8e574909c8d80.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/69216e0f531ae12996c1fea6d785844e4b1d5cb6f74e5a1f1b39973b6d6f25d5.png Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 10 [Deal Alert] Get the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 ($19 off) from Best Buy 2017/04/22 6:21pm PDTApr 22, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 45 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 80 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares176 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 22, 2017 11:40 am Google Play Store has been updated to revamp ‘My apps & games’ section, which is now more organised. Google Play Store has been updated to revamp ‘My apps & games’ section, which is now more organised. In the Play Store, Android users will now see their apps sorted in categories such as Updates, Installed, Library and Beta. People who’ve not signed-up for beta program for any of the apps will not see ‘Beta’ tab. The new categories now show more relevant information upfront such as size of update and an estimated timeline of when the app was last used. The most notable change is the ability to sort installed on the basis of Alphabetical order, Last updated, Last used or Size. Further, the format has been changed to make lists look visually appealing and spaced out. Updates tab in ‘My apps & games’ has a list of all apps on smartphone with update size for each mentioned right below their names. Users can choose to update all apps together via ‘Update All’ option on top or individually by clicking on ‘Update’ button besides each app. There’s a ‘Recently updated’ list as well as users scroll down in ‘Updates’ tab. Up next is ‘Installed’ tab, apps in which can now be sorted by alphabetical order, last updated, last used or size. The change is significant given it makes it easier for users to decide if they want to uninstall apps they’ve not used in a long time. Along with individual app sizes, more relevant information like when it was last used (minutes, hours, day etc) shows up as well. People who’ve not signed-up for beta program for any of the apps will not see ‘Beta’ tab. Library suggest users to install apps that are associated with their account, but not installed on smartphone. For example, users might use same account to log in to multiple smartphones and download different apps on them. However, it is likely they would want to download all apps on all of their devices. Library tab prompts users to download apps synced to their Google account, most of which appear to have been used at least once by the user either in the past or on another device. Google has removed ‘Subscriptions’ tab as well. The update makes it easier for users to spot relevant information in a glance. Additionally, apps can now be immediately launched by clicking on ‘Open’ option along side individual apps. Previously, users had to open apps by first viewing their Play Store listing page and then clicking on ‘Open’ button.

Do small things like eating less meat, opting for carpooling, and unplugging unused electronic devices that could go a long way in helping save the planet. “Whatever you do today, we hope you’re able to take a moment to savour and cherish this boundless, stunning Earth that we inhabit,” Google said in a statement. At an estimated 4.543 billion years of age, the Earth is also the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. Google’s Earth Day Doodle follows the story of a fox who dreams about an Earth that has been polluted and adversely affected by climate change. Also Read : The history behind Earth Day, everything you need to know The fox wakes with a startle, and urgently starts making small lifestyle changes to care for the Earth. Along the way, the fox enlists friends – including Momo the cat, and Google Weather’s favourite frog – to join its quest to protect and nurture the environment. To combat things like coral bleaching and pollution, the three eco-rangers are inspired to take action such as eating less meat, carpooling, and unplugging unused electronic devices. “That’s some heroic work for tiny animals!” Google said. Can we humans do a little more? That is probably the question that will arise in everyone’s mind after watching the Doodle. To help answer, Google Search offers easy Earth Day tips to help you do your part in saving our planet, including supporting critical conservation efforts such as wildlife conservation with World Wildlife Fund and coral reef conservation with The Ocean Agency.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do...

Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

It starts today with the launch of the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Elias Roman, Lead Product Manager at Google Play Music, said in announcing the partnership that those with a new Samsung device can now upload and stream up to 100,000 of their songs to the service absolutely free. That’s twice as much storage capacity exclusively for Samsung customers, we’re told, which should make it even easier for users to migrate their personal music collection to Google Play Music. It doesn’t end there, however, as new Samsung mobile devices will also come with a free three-month trial of the streaming service that offers ad-free, on-demand access to more than 40 million tracks and thousands of playlists curated for a variety of moods and occasions. A subscription also grants access to YouTube Red, the ad-free version of Google's popular video sharing service that launched in late 2015. Last but not least, Google Play Music will integrate seamlessly with Bixby when English language voice support arrives later this spring. Samsung launched its own streaming music service, called Milk Music, in early 2014 but shut it down back in September (probably because that name was so terrible, no?). Will Google’s partnership with Samsung sway your decision to pick up a Galaxy S8 or S8+ (or any other Samsung device on your radar) or is it just icing on the cake?

Do small things like eating less meat, opting for carpooling, and unplugging unused electronic devices that could go a long way in helping save the planet. "Whatever you do today, we hope you're able to take a moment to savour and cherish this boundless, stunning Earth that we inhabit," Google said in a statement. At an estimated 4.543 billion years of age, the Earth is also the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. Google's Earth Day Doodle follows the story of a fox who dreams about an Earth that has been polluted and adversely affected by climate change. The fox wakes with a startle, and urgently starts making small lifestyle changes to care for the Earth. Along the way, the fox enlists friends - including Momo the cat, and Google Weather's favourite frog - to join its quest to protect and nurture the environment. To combat things like coral bleaching and pollution, the three eco-rangers are inspired to take action such as eating less meat, carpooling, and unplugging unused electronic devices. "That's some heroic work for tiny animals!" Google said. Can we humans do a little more? That is probably the question that will arise in everyone's mind after watching the Doodle. To help answer, Google Search offers easy Earth Day tips to help you do your part in saving our planet, including supporting critical conservation efforts such as wildlife conservation with World Wildlife Fund and coral reef conservation with The Ocean Agency. --IANS gb/in SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features India sizzles as heat wave grips states Assam soaks in joy, celebrates Bihu No bars on highways Rare April snow, heavy rains cut off Kashmir Dalai Lama's Arunachal visit rattles China, jubilates exiled Buddhists About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares101 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response?

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 80 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares176 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month.

Google, the biggest player in this world, is at the center of the plan, although the company and its partners are keen to present the initiative as a group effort. The Coalition for Better Ads published a list of undesirable online ads earlier this year. Google plans to add a feature to its Chrome web browser that would disable those ads. The feature is designed for publishers, rather than a tool for consumers, and would operate the same way Chrome already filters ads that are undesirable in other ways like those that drain computer batteries, according to people familiar with the plans. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Google’s potential decision earlier this week, sparking criticism that the search ad giant was again exerting too much control over the market for digital ads. Now industry partners are stressing that the plan is a group effort and not finalized. They also distanced Google’s tool from the existing ad blockers that prompted the initiative in the first place. “There is no ad-blocker that’s going into a browser,” Randall Rothenberg, head of the Interactive Advertising Bureau trade group, said, although he wouldn’t offer further details on the tool. “What we want is something that’s industry-wide, that can demonstrably improve user experience and that’s embraced by pretty much everyone.” Rothenberg helped set up the Coalition for Better Ads in September. Beyond Google, members include some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, media organizations and Facebook Inc. In March, the group issued its list of ad units — including those that takeover entire screens or videos that start automatically — that it claimed are most likely to prompt people to download ad blockers. The Chrome option is different from current ad-blockers, which are downloaded as mobile apps or web browser plug-ins to zap most marketing messages, according to people familiar with the plans. Instead it may look like similar tools that Google builds into its browser. Last fall, Chrome began automatically disabling ads that use multimedia Flash players, citing computer battery drain. People in the Coalition said they expect Google will also hold its own search, display and YouTube ads to the same standards it imposes on the rest of the industry, although the terms have not been finalized. The people asked not to be identified discussing private matters. Alphabet Inc.’s Google declined to comment on potential Chrome features. However, the company emphasized that its plans are part of a group effort. “Google alone cannot solve for the incentives users have to install ad blockers,” a company spokeswoman said. “We need an industry approach that is data-driven and endorsed by everyone.” Getting broad support is hard. The ad industry has diverse interests and Google is still facing a backlash over its failure to quell offensive videos on YouTube. Some of the types of ads derided in the Coalition’s list, such as full-screen takeovers and automatic pre-roll video ads with sound, can deliver three to four times higher ad rates for publishers, according to Matt McGowan, president of marketing software firm Adestra Ltd. Many of these media companies are already suffering declining revenue as digital ad spending moves increasingly to Google’s and Facebook’s dominant platforms. Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for Venable LLP who counsels the Coalition for Better Ads, said the group is still months away from issuing policies on “acceptable” ad standards. “All the options are on the table,” he said. An attempt from Google, the largest digital ad-seller, to limit other companies’ ads through its browser could open the company to further antitrust scrutiny. Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, wrote on Twitter that she would “follow this new feature” closely. She is already overseeing a multi-pronged antitrust case against Google. As ad-blocking tools spread, Google has plotted ways to curb the potential impact on its primary business. Scott Spencer, a veteran director of its display ad unit, is in charge of its efforts and he sits on the Coalition board. In the past, Google has reportedly paid the makers of consumer ad-blocking tools to keep Google’s ads off their blacklists. Owning a filtering solution, such as a built-in Chrome feature, would help Google avoid this. It also addresses the company’s longstanding obsession with eliminating any obstacle between it and its users. “The situation tweaks the most paranoid part of Google’s culture — to never be disintermediated,” said Ari Paparo, a former Google ad executive who runs ad tech company Beeswax. Chrome was launched in 2008 so Google’s search engine would not be at the mercy of browser providers of the time such as Microsoft Corp. Leaders of the ads Coalition said other tech companies, like Microsoft and Facebook, will be involved in setting standards. “Something that’s only one browser is not really worth it,” said Rothenberg. Yet, while the group is large, it is not comprehensive. Apple Inc., which controls the Safari browser on iPhones, and The Mozilla Corporation, which runs the Firefox browser, are not members of the Coalition. Firefox includes a browser setting that blocks ads and Apple began allowing third-party tools that block content on its mobile browser last year. “Not everyone is going to be involved at the same time,” Rothenberg said. “This ain’t the UN.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: ChromeGoogle You may also like Sony nearly triples annual profit forecast 2 hours ago  Technology Airtel rolls out 4G service in Nigeria 3 hours ago  Telecoms Orbital cargo ship arrives at space station 3 hours ago  Technology Latest Neymar ban dispute rages ahead of Clasico 1 hour ago  Sport Why DSS stormed Pencom, by insider 2 hours ago  Nigeria Buhari says war against insurgency depends on rescue of all Chibok girls 2 hours ago  Nigeria World Malaria Day: Mosquito nets as most effective way to prevent Malaria 2 hours ago  Health Shiites dismiss Osinbajo’s stance on detention of Sheikh El-Zakzaky 2 hours ago  Nigeria More   Communication NITDA denies employment racketeering reports 2 days ago   Fakers control 10% phone market share in Nigeria 2 days ago   ​EFCC requires computer forensic experts to win cases, says Adeoye 2 days ago   SMSaaS has strong future with Telcos as ‘Gatekeepers’, says Pearson 14 Apr   Stakeholders frown at connectivity issues 14 Apr   Top News Nigeria Africa World Metro Opinion Editorial Contributors Columnists Cartoons Business Appointments Business News Business RoundUp Industry Aviation Capital Market Communications Energy DrillBytes Maritime SweetCrude Infrastructure Money Technology Gadgets Telecoms Social Media Technology Sport Football Boxing Athletics Tennis Golf Arts Arts Art House Artfolk Revue Film Literature Music Theatre Visual Arts Features Policy & Politics BusinessAgro Education Executive Motoring Executive Briefs Focus Friday Worship Law Media Science Youth Speak Property Environment Mortgage Finance Real Estate Urban Development Guardian Woman Entrepreneurship GW Fiction Personality Issues WIMBIZ Saturday Magazine Youth Magazine Just Human Life & Style Love & Life Transition Travel & Tourism Celebrity Brand Intelligence Gardening Weekend Beats Sunday Magazine Ibru Ecumenical Centre Campus CityFile News Feature Living Healthy Diet Living Wellbeing Newspeople Guardian TV News Opinion Fashion Sport Entertainment Science & Tech GTV Exclusive Guardian Life Home Lifestyle Showbiz Trending LS Diaries On The Cover The Guardian Home About Us Advertise With Us |     Powered by Ventra Copyright © 2017 Guardian Newspapers.

How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares88 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Syukri Lajin Google doesn't backup call history and sms. that's the only shitty part i have to complain about. JohnyNoLegs It does do SMS 100% as i just restored from a reset. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Killa Can you head into your Google Drive and look at the Backups for your Pixel? Is each content type separated out...like text, call history, etc.? Impulse_Vigil I'm not seeing it on the mobile app, dunno if it's visible on desktop or the site, or if they just hide it somehow... The settings page does say Drive tho, it's kinda weird. Not even sure whether they're counting this towards one's Google account storage or what. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Chang Hi, I posted this, but it got kicked to bottom of thread. So, here it is again. Hope it is some help. Gen. Chang • 43 minutes ago Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Xchris Big deal. Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, that's one of you so far. Impulse_Vigil You polled Pixel users huh? abc "The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites" That's just sad for Android then. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7. Hexlattice On slower internet speeds, Photos has a really hard time trying to backup larger files... Normally, getting on a faster network will fix the problem, but if the files are old enough, it's like Photos gives up on trying and I end up having some videos never backup :( abc Pixel problems? https://i.imgflip.com/h8wog.jpg?a414600 Gen. Chang Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Praneeth Kancherla They have been looking into it from past few months. Backups on my Pixel XL never worked. I've contacted support through chat option on the phone and all information I got at the end is Google is aware of this issue,actively working on fixing it and fix will be available soon. It looks meaning of soon is certainly different​ in Google's dictionary. Lately my phone has developed so much lag even while doing simple tasks like using keyboard in any app, browsing internet and settings. Google support is okay to replace my device after verifying warranty but cannot ship replacement first even if I'm okay with hold on my credit card for full amount and covering shipping charges. They say replacement may take anytime from 7-10 business days and I need to buy another phone. The reason they quote is I'm not the original buyer. But they were able to verify and confirm that it's​ still under warranty. They are okay with honoring the warranty but not willing to ship replacement first even if I'm okay with covering charges that may incur in doing that. All these issues for $750 smartphone and they taking months to resolve issues without any possible workaround is just terrible in my opinion. I'll still use Pixel and Android as I like them compared to Apple and its ecosystem but I feel Google is certainly not doing enough to retain consumers like me.

It’s handy, sure, but the new tab page can be much more useful. The key to productivity is finding out what works for you. Don’t just apply what a productivity guru says without thinking about your needs. The New Tab page can serve many purposes. If you don’t need a collection of your most visited sites, turn it into something you actually need. Web apps and extensions are the best way to make this happen. But when you are choosing one, try to find something that works across all browsers. That way, you aren’t restricted to one browser or device alone. 1. Searf (Web): Customized Search Bar and Bookmarks You can integrate different search engines in the URL bar How To Create Custom Search Engines In Google Chrome How To Create Custom Search Engines In Google Chrome Read More of any browser you use. But if that’s not you, Searf is the next best option. In the setup process, Searf asks you to choose your favorite websites. Then it asks you for the search engines you use most often. Searf will combine your answers into a custom page for you, which looks a lot like the Google homepage. In the top-left corner, you’ll find your favorite sites, while the large search bar dominates the page. This bar can search whichever engines you chose, like Google, Wikipedia, or YouTube. Searf has an extension for Google Chrome, but also works as a standalone web app. Make it the default address for any New Tab page in your browser’s settings. 2. Minimalist (Web): Portable Minimalist To-Do List To be productive, you need to know what you have to do next. Minimalist is a gorgeous and clutter-free to-do list 8 Super Simple To-Do List Tools to Keep You Focused 8 Super Simple To-Do List Tools to Keep You Focused A to-do list is the simplest productivity system. These eight minimalist to-do list tools are for tracking your daily tasks without the fuss. Read More that works in any web browser. It’s one large page with the default to-do list in the middle of it. In the left-side pane, you can create additional lists, to separate your “work tasks” and your “grocery” lists. Finish an item and check the box next to it, so Minimalist will give it a satisfying strikethrough. Nothing like striking items on a to-do list, is there? You can create a new list and add the custom URL as your New Tab page. I would also recommend signing in to it with Google, since that will let you visit Minimalist.com from any device and bring up your list. 3. Awesome HQ (Web): Windows-Like Tiles for Your Browser If you loved the look of Windows Phone’s Live Tiles, then Awesome HQ is for you. The tile-like interface also makes it one of the few New Tab pages that you can use on a mobile browser as well. You will need to sign in with a Google login Should You Think Twice Before Logging In Using Social Accounts? Should You Think Twice Before Logging In Using Social Accounts? Read More to choose the sites you want to add as tiles. Once logged in, Awesome HQ will bring up weather information for your location, arrange bookmarks as beautiful logos, and even add widgets like the latest XKCD comic. Be warned that the login process is a bit temperamental. It didn’t work for one of the writers at MakeUseOf, but did for another. 4. Shrib / ProtectedText / Textpad (Web): A Simple Notepad We couldn’t choose between these three wonderful online notepads to use as a New Tab page, so see what works best for you. Shrib is one of our favorite web apps that don’t need you to register 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use Do you like websites which have no sign-ups, no registerations, and no downloads? Then, you will like these hassle free web apps and sites which make daily productivity a lot easier. Read More . As long as you bookmark the URL, you’re good to go. It will auto-save anything you type in the notepad. Protected Text lets you choose your URL name, which is a big bonus. It also password-protects the document. The design is a bit old-school and clunky, but no one else will see what you type. Textpad is the most modern of three, a minimalistic notepad that also counts characters and words. The only problem is it saves data locally, so you can’t use it across browsers. But hey, your notes aren’t going into the cloud, so that’s a security boost. 5. Live Start Page (Chrome, Firefox, Opera): The All-in-One Extension There are some things web apps can’t do. Live Start Page is perhaps the best cross-platform New Tab extension. Live Start Page has three basic features. It showcases beautiful live wallpapers as backgrounds, with a new one coming every day. There’s a meditation mode to help you destress and focus on what matters. And the productivity dashboard 10 Most Productive New Tab Extensions For Google Chrome 10 Most Productive New Tab Extensions For Google Chrome When you start a new tab in a browser, are you looking to go somewhere or are you looking for information to come to you?

Instead, it will filter ads that don’t meet Google’s specific criteria. The criteria, outlined in the Initial Better Ads Standards, deem around 12 current advertising systems and techniques to be unsuitable and downright annoying for users. Pre-content pop-ups, ads that just won’t stop playing or shutting up, or ads that stick to panes of a browser tab are all on the naughty list. Google Chrome could soon feature its own adblocker to stop users installing their own Largely Google, and its advertising coalition partners, explained that these ad methods resulted in an “increased propensity for consumers to adopt ad blockers”. And Google doesn’t want you to install adblockers. Alphabet announced that Google’s advertising revenue grew 17% year-on-year to US$22.4-billion in Q4 2016 alone. According to Juniper Research (cited by CNBC), adblocking could cost the ad industry around US$22-billion by 2020. That’s not a statistic the internet giant wants to see. The benefits for you, and for the web While adding its own adblocking system to Chrome has obvious company benefits, is pretty big news for both consumers and site-owners too. Chrome’s adblocker gives the company the power to drop all ads from a site if said site doesn’t adhere to its standards. For sites, this spells entire advertising system changes, better standards, and overall, a cleaner web. Considering Chrome’s browser market share — as high as 58% depending on your source — advertisers will have to adhere sooner or later. For consumers, this could mark the beginning of a more pleasant web, with less clutter, and fewer annoyances. WSJ’s report suggests that the feature could be announced “within weeks” but that’s if the internet giant ultimately follows through with the plan. Now, if Google can only do something about those toxic comment sections.

Rumor: Google to bake ad-blocking into Chrome browser by Wayne Manion  9:00 AM on April 21, 2017 The Wall Street Journal reports that Google intends to include an ad-blocking component in future versions of its popular Chrome web browser. The new feature reportedly will be enabled by default in both the desktop and mobile versions of the browser. The WSJ says the rumors come from sources "familiar with Google's plans." The paper says the blocking will be targeted at ads deemed "beneath a threshhold of consumer acceptability." While at first the notion that a major player in online advertising would offer features to disable ads in one of its most popular software products seems counter-intuitve, recent trends suggest the idea is not as strange as it sounds at first. According to the WSJ's sources, the built-in ad-blocker would stop ads that do not conform to the specifications of the Coalition for Better Ads, which counts both Google and Facebook as members. According to this industry body, non-compliant content includes autoplaying video ads with sound, pop-ups, and ads with countdown timers. The WSJ goes on to report that Google may be considering blocking all ads, compliant and not, on pages that show even one non-compliant ad. This move may be a result of the increasing numbers of users employing ad-blocking browser extensions like Adblock Plus and uBlock Origin. Desktop users have long been able to use ad-blocking extensions like these within Chrome to keep this type of content off their screen, but the mobile versions of the browser lack support for extensions. If integrated blocking of ads with particularly annoying delivery methods can prevent users from installing sofware that blocks all ads, compliant advertisers could stand to benefit. Of course, Google has a large dog in this fight, as well. The company is one of the largest sellers of online advertising around, and it's paid Adblock Plus developer Eyeo to whitelist its ads for at least some period of time in the past. We expect there's no love lost between Eyeo and Google, and Mountain View would doubtless like to keep the considerable fees it pays the plugin developer to ensure its ads appear even to Adblock Plus-running users. Including a proprietary ad-blocking plugin that works on Google's terms would doubtless give a decent swath of Chrome users no reason to install Eyeo's product. The problem with Google's approach is that it would create a huge conflict of interest. As the owner of one of the most popular browsers in the world, Google would stand to wield an enormous amount of power over the shape of the web advertising market by developing an ad-blocking plugin. If the company's AdSense products just so happen to comply with its own internal guidelines by default, Google could (intentionally or otherwise) favor the display of its own ad products over those of other ad networks. Google's rumored move could also have a chilling effect on the revenue of sites that rely on advertising to keep the lights on. If the company implements the aggressive form of ad-blocking described above wherein one non-compliant ad would cause Google to block all ads on a page, it's not clear how a publisher would appeal the decision or return to good standing. By creating a de facto standard for acceptable ads, Google could also limit the amount of money advertisers might be willing to funnel into traditional ad campaigns, leading to a rise in harder-to-track and impossible-to-block forms of content like sponsored native articles. For our part, TR has always taken every reasonable measure to make sure advertisements with these objectionable techniques don't appear to readers on our site. Fewer users employing blanket bans on advertising is something that we'd like to see, but we're not sure that a Google-produced plugin is the best arbiter of what constitutes an acceptable ad. Either way, we'd encourage readers to whitelist TR in their ad blockers. You'll find we run ads that are already plenty acceptable by any standard.

Google, the biggest player in this world, is at the centre of the plan, although the company and its partners are keen to present the initiative as a group effort. The Coalition for Better Ads published a list of undesirable online ads earlier this year. Google plans to add a feature to its Chrome web browser that would disable those ads. The feature is designed for publishers, rather than a tool for consumers, and would operate the same way Chrome already filters ads that are undesirable in other ways like those that drain computer batteries, according to people familiar with the plans. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Google’s potential decision earlier this week, sparking criticism that the search ad giant was again exerting too much control over the market for digital ads. Now industry partners are stressing that the plan is a group effort and not finalised. They also distanced Google’s tool from the existing ad blockers that prompted the initiative in the first place.  “There is no ad-blocker that’s going into a browser,” Randall Rothenberg, head of the Interactive Advertising Bureau trade group, said, although he wouldn’t offer further details on the tool. “What we want is something that’s industry-wide, that can demonstrably improve user experience and that’s embraced by pretty much everyone.”  Rothenberg helped set up the Coalition for Better Ads in September. Beyond Google, members include some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, media organisations and Facebook Inc. In March, the group issued its list of ad units — including those that takeover entire screens or videos that start automatically — that it claimed are most likely to prompt people to download ad blockers. The Chrome option is different from current ad-blockers, which are downloaded as mobile apps or web browser plug-ins to zap most marketing messages, according to people familiar with the plans. Instead it may look like similar tools that Google builds into its browser. Last fall, Chrome began automatically disabling ads that use multimedia Flash players, citing computer battery drain. People in the Coalition said they expect Google will also hold its own search, display and YouTube ads to the same standards it imposes on the rest of the industry, although the terms have not been finalised. The people asked not to be identified discussing private matters. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to comment on potential Chrome features. However, the company emphasised that its plans are part of a group effort. “Google alone cannot solve for the incentives users have to install ad blockers,” a company spokeswoman said. “We need an industry approach that is data-driven and endorsed by everyone.”  Getting broad support is hard. The ad industry has diverse interests and Google is still facing a backlash over its failure to quell offensive videos on YouTube. Some of the types of ads derided in the Coalition’s list, such as full-screen takeovers and automatic pre-roll video ads with sound, can deliver three to four times higher ad rates for publishers, according to Matt McGowan, president of marketing software firm Adestra Ltd. Many of these media companies are already suffering declining revenue as digital ad spending moves increasingly to Google’s and Facebook’s dominant platforms.  Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for Venable LLP who counsels the Coalition for Better Ads, said the group is still months away from issuing policies on “acceptable” ad standards. ”All the options are on the table,” he said.  An attempt from Google, the largest digital ad-seller, to limit other companies’ ads through its browser could open the company to further antitrust scrutiny. Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, wrote on Twitter that she would “follow this new feature” closely. She is already overseeing a multi-pronged antitrust case against Google. As ad-blocking tools spread, Google has plotted ways to curb the potential impact on its primary business. Scott Spencer, a veteran director of its display ad unit, is in charge of its efforts and he sits on the Coalition board. In the past, Google has reportedly paid the makers of consumer ad-blocking tools to keep Google’s ads off their blacklists. Owning a filtering solution, such as a built-in Chrome feature, would help Google avoid this. It also addresses the company’s longstanding obsession with eliminating any obstacle between it and its users. “The situation tweaks the most paranoid part of Google’s culture — to never be disintermediated,” said Ari Paparo, a former Google ad executive who runs ad tech company Beeswax. Chrome was launched in 2008 so Google’s search engine would not be at the mercy of browser providers of the time such as Microsoft Corp Leaders of the ads Coalition said other tech companies, like Microsoft and Facebook, will be involved in setting standards. “Something that’s only one browser is not really worth it,” said Rothenberg.  Yet, while the group is large, it is not comprehensive. Apple Inc, which controls the Safari browser on iPhones, and The Mozilla Corporation, which runs the Firefox browser, are not members of the Coalition. Firefox includes a browser setting that blocks ads and Apple began allowing third-party tools that block content on its mobile browser last year.  “Not everyone is going to be involved at the same time,” Rothenberg said. “This ain’t the UN.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Six ZX Spectrum classics and their modern-day equivalents Pinterest to start its first US advertising campaign Tech week in review — Netflix, F8 Conference and Juicero (VIDEO) This startup uses mini cameras to track animals' brain activity (VIDEO) Amazon's Twitch wants more game-streamers to make money on site Samsung users see red over ‘tinted’ Galaxy S8 screen Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone’s 10th anniversary Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash 90-second recap of Samsung Galaxy S8 with ‘Gadgets with Gurman’ (VIDEO) Netflix growth misses mark despite strong earnings Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Unions, activists protest ahead of first round of French presidential election Reuters Video: Love is all around — even between Barcelona and Real Madrid Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines Related Articles Machine learning may fix ad placement dispute, says Google Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan suspend YouTube ads over offensive videos (VIDEO) AT&T, Verizon join Google ad boycott Google apologises to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

The company that Palihapitiya lured the engineers to is called Groq Inc., at least for now - but there's little known about Groq. There are a few SEC filings from October and December, with the company raising $10.3 million. In its SEC documents, Groq named three principals: Jonathan Ross, who helped invent the TPU, Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X "moonshot factory" and Palihapitiya, the founder of investment firm Social Capital. The listed address is Social Capital's headquarters, reports CNBC.   Palihapitiya said in an email: "We're really excited about Groq. It's too early to talk specifics, but we think what they're building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing". The fundamental building block for the next generation of computing? Alright, now I'm excited.   During an interview on Squawk Box, Palihapitiya said: "They randomly mentioned that they built their own chip for AI and I thought, what is going on here, why is Google competing with Intel?". Last month, Palihapitiya said that the innovation of driving towards the next big leap in processors "can empower companies like Facebook and Amazon, Tesla, the government to do things with machine learning and computers that nobody could do before".   Bring it on.

A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos, and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. Sean Askay, engineering manager with Google Earth, demonstrates features displayed in the background. The mapping service is becoming more of a tool for adventure. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You also can get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. The producers of “Sesame Street” show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture. Separately, a new “I’m Feeling Lucky” feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken, part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys.  A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. The update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or “getting lost.” With the update, Google Earth now works on Google’s Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there’s no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Some older features still will require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook’s Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive. But it won’t work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google’s Daydream and Samsung’s Gear VR.

Fancy people, this one's for you. If you own a Mercedes and also have either a Google Home or Amazon Echo speaker, you can now start your car with the sound of your voice. All 2016 and 2017 Mercedes-Benz models in the US now work with Amazon and Google's voice-powered speakers. If you have a Google Home device, just say "Ok Google, tell Mercedes me to start my car" to get your engine going. Or, if you have an Amazon Alexa-powered device, say "Alexa, ask Mercedes Me to send an address to the car" before you hit the road. This way, you won't have to fumble with your navigation system when you're ready to roll. You can also ask your speaker to remotely lock your vehicle.

"Mercedes-Benz's goal is creating an intelligent ecosystem around cars, and developing cutting-edge technology to make everyday life more convenient for our customers." To get it to work, you'll need an active Mercedes me account and mbrace subscription. From there, just download the Google Home or Amazon Alexa app and connect it with Mercedes me. The feature is currently available in the US, and Mercedes plans to launch it in Europe later this year. Mercedes earlier this month teamed up with Bosch to make robo-taxis a reality by the beginning of the next decade. By combining forces, it is expected that Mercedes will knock several years off of its existing driverless vehicle efforts.

With its doodle, Google has tried to guide us on ways we can play our roles as caretakers of the environment, which in turn will also help protect the Earth.   ﻿ By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Saturday, April 22, 2017 - 08:38 Comment 0 Comment Image courtesy: Google New Delhi: April 22nd every year marks the onset of Earth Day. A day that is celebrated annually to raise awareness about our home planet and how we can save and protect it from recurring damage. Started in the year 1970, Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network and celebrated in more than 193 countries each year. Every year, the event is celebrated under a different theme. The theme for 2017 is “Environmental and Climate Literacy”, chosen to empower everyone with the knowledge to inspire action in defense of environmental protection. With this in mind, Google decided to impart some wisdom on how to safeguard the environment and encourage people across the world to be more environmentally friendly with its interactive doodle today. Google's latest doodle for Earth Day is in the form of a slideshow and shows a fox who dreams about an Earth that's been polluted and adversely affected by climate change and how it makes small changes in its lifestyle to avoid the dream turning into a reality. In present times, when the dangers of climate change and global warming loom as large as ever, there is a constant pressure upon the entire world to do their bit and contribute towards the betterment of our home planet. Why? Because there is only one Earth. The doodle also features Momo the cat, and Google Weather's favorite frog who accompany the fox in its quest to save the environment. With its doodle, Google has tried to guide us on ways we can play our roles as caretakers of the environment, which in turn will also help protect the Earth. Efforts like using less electricity, riding bicycle instead of buses, use of wind turbines and solar panels and plant greenery. However, Earth Day is not just an event to be observed on one specific day. It is primarily a reminder for all to do our rightful duty to save our planet everyday. Earth Day is a motivation for you to start right now. Happy Earth Day!

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: Spinraza Woes, Science March, Baseline Launch & More Ben Fidler April 21st, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Rumblings of a new Obamacare replacement surfaced this week, while scientists and their supporters prepared for Saturday’s—a.k.a. Earth Day’s—nationwide Marches for Science. Our own reporting focused this week on the fallout from high drug prices, with a look at the frustration of families whose children have had trouble gaining access to the first drug ever approved for the rare spinal muscular atrophy. Elsewhere, Google’s cousin Verily finally launched a much ballyhooed health study, Novartis grabbed more momentum in the race toward the first CAR-T cell therapy approval, and a lot more news happened around the Xconomy network, with reports from Seattle to San Antonio and Indianapolis to North Carolina. Let’s get to the roundup. TOP STORIES —The high price and limited access to nusinersen (Spinraza), the first approved drug for spinal muscular atrophy, has left families of patients exasperated. but data that Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) will present at the American Academy of Neurology meeting next week could loosen the restrictions. Xconomy heard from SMA families and clinicians about the logistical and insurance challenges that have slowed the nusinersen rollout. —Phoenix Biotechnology, a small San Antonio firm, has spent more than a decade trying to develop a plant-based drug for cancer. Running out of time and money, the company is pinning its future on preclinical data showing the drug might have a chance to treat Alzheimer’s disease. —After three years of planning, Verily, once known as Google Life Sciences, has begun a long-range health study called “Baseline” with at least 10,000 participants across four years, aiming to learn about the biological changes underpinning the shift from health to illness. People who have grown accustomed to instant health information from their wearables might be surprised; Verily is not going to share the day-to-day data it gathers via its homebrewed “Study Watch.” MARCH FOR SCIENCE, TRUMPCARE REVIVAL? —Looking ahead to the March for Science on Saturday, Prothena CEO Gene Kinney penned this op-ed about the need for biotech professionals to explain science better to folks who aren’t immersed in the field. —Weeks after the GOP’s healthcare plan crashed without reaching a House vote, efforts have begun to revive the bill, Politico reported. The news comes as the Trump administration has threatened to revoke federal subsidies that help support the Affordable Care Act. Here’s more in the Washington Post. TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS —A rheumatoid arthritis drug from Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and partner Incyte (NASDAQ: INCY) that was expected to win FDA approval was instead rejected, as the regulator asked the companies to provide more dosing and safety data. —Ultragenyx (NASDAQ: RARE), of Novato, CA, and partner Kyowa Hakko Kirin aim to file for approval of burosumab, for the rare genetic disease X-linked hypophosphatemia, after the drug hit its main goal in a Phase 3 trial. —Novartis’s CTL-019 grabbed a second FDA “breakthrough” designation, this time in the diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Novartis is racing Kite Pharma (NASDAQ: KITE) to get the first CAR-T cancer immunotherapy across the finish line. Here’s more from TheStreet.com. —Two weeks after a round of bad news, Redwood City, CA-based OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: OMED), disclosed another clinical trial failure this week, this time in lung cancer. The firm plans to begin “a comprehensive portfolio prioritization review immediately.” —Even though an independent board said in February that an experimental immunotherapy for kidney cancer from Argos Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ARGS) was unlikely to work, the Durham, NC, company said this week it would press on with the Phase 3 trial. Argos said its own analysis suggests a longer follow-up time may yet show a beneficial effect. MONEY MANEUVERS —Research Triangle Park, NC-based G1 Therapeutics unveiled plans for an initial public offering to finance clinical trials for its experimental cancer therapies that target two enzymes, CDK 4 and 6, that are key to cellular division. —Controversial former Dendreon CEO Mitch Gold is back on Wall Street, now that his latest startup, Seattle-based Alpine Immune Sciences, has cut a deal to merge with struggling Nivalis Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NVLS) in a bid to go public. The combined company will be run by Gold and take on the Alpine name. —Boston-based ZappRx, a startup that helps patients order and refill specialty medicine prescriptions, raised $25 million in new funding and added GV, the venture capital arm of Google, to its base of investors. PARP TALK, ETC. —Waltham, MA-based Tesaro (NASDAQ: TSRO) disclosed that its recently approved cancer drug, a so-called PARP inhibitor named niraparib (Zejula), would cost $9,833 a month for a 200 mg dose. While lower than rival drugs, the actual price is a more complicated because patients start on a higher, more expensive dose, and many move to lower doses afterwards. Here’s more in Endpoints. —In other PARP blocker news, AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) said that its PARP inhibitor velaparib failed two Phase 3 trials in lung and breast cancer. —UniQure (NASDAQ: QURE) will pull alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera), the Western world’s first ever approved gene therapy, from the market in October. Glybera was a flop—only one patient was treated with it commercially—but it also played an important role in the advancement of gene therapy as a field. —The legal feud continued between Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDQ: REGN) and Sanofi. Already battling over their cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 blockers, Amgen sued over patents granted to Regeneron and Sanofi for their newly approved eczema drug, dupilumab (Dupixent). Expecting the lawsuit, Regeneron and Sanofi had filed a pre-emptive legal strike against Amgen last month. Here’s more in FiercePharma. Alex Lash and Frank Vinluan contributed to this report.

Which Won't Make it to 2067? View All Editorials → Apple Hires Satellite Experts away from Google Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin 1 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 9:05 PM EDT | Analysis Apple has hired away a pair of Google’s top satellite experts, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Citing unnamed sources, Mr. Gurman reported that Apple hired John Fenwick, who previously led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering at Google. They are part of a new hardware team at Apple headed by another former Googler, Dropcam cofounder Greg Duffy. Apple in the Skies? Apple Hires Satellite Experts The first question you might have is why Apple would want to make satellites. The answer to that could be in a recent Boeing regulatory filing. According to Bloomberg, Boeing is working on plans for a network of 1,000 satellites that would provide broadband internet access. That service could be offered anywhere, including areas with no wired or wireless telephone infrastructure. Boeing has reportedly talked to Apple about being part of the project. Whether or not that’s true, and whether or not Apple is going to work with Boeing, it’s easy to understand that Apple could be interested in offering that sort of service. Opening up the third world to high speed internet access is a goal of many tech giants, and that would certainly include Apple. The company could also turn such an operation into a direct revenue generator in the developed world. Bloomberg noted that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. forecasted $30 billion in satellite internet revenues by 2025. That’s serious money even for Apple. Apple could also use a satellite fleet for multiple purposes. The company could take its own photographs for Apple Maps, and sell those images on the open market like Google. Apple could also contribute to or compete with existing global positioning systems. Perhaps most importantly, Apple could use satellites to augment its own data distribution for iTunes and the App Store. Or Maybe Not Apple has tons of projects, most of which get killed along the way. Just because Apple hired two satellite experts and has them working in a new hardware team doesn’t necessarily mean Apple will ever be involved with satellites. In addition, just because these two folks are satellite experts doesn’t necessarily mean this team is even working on satellites. They’re reporting to someone who isn’t a satellite expert, for instance. But, it’s interesting news no matter how you slice it. I think many Apple fans would love for Apple to launch its own ISP, especially if it was dedicated to Apple’s existing commitment to privacy and security.

April 21, 2017 at 11:46 EDT PM ibuck April 22, 2017 “I think many Apple fans would love for Apple to launch its own ISP, especially if it was dedicated to Apple’s existing commitment to privacy and security.” That would be out of this world. April 22, 2017 at 1:14 EDT AM wab95 April 22, 2017 Bryan: As you’ve averred, there are a number of potential roles that satellites could play in Apple’s orbit (I know, lame, but irresistible). There are several amongst the low and middle income countries that have made hard target deadlines for rolling out internet access to their remotest regions, some of which will be satellite dependent. If Apple want to have access to these markets, and provide their services and platform, then engaging with Boeing or anyone else in that space (pun not intended), makes strategic sense. This also may provide Apple with an escape route around infrastructure controlled by a hostile or competing interests, be they government or private sector, as the privacy, censorship, and service wars continue to rage without sheriff or shepherd to serve as honest and empowered referee. There is little doubt that Apple have a longterm plan for the further development and consolidation of their platform, which will be dependent on an infrastructure that is future-proofed and option-rich.

F8 Conference: App analytics, custom push notifications, Account Kit & more Home » Apps, developers, Facebook, Facebook F8, Internet, messaging, Mobile, Social Media Facebook F8 2017 Lowdown: Messenger 2.0, Workplace, AR Studio, Spaces By Salman SH ( @Sallu_SH ) on April 19, 2017 April 19, 2017 by Salman SH 00 At Facebook’s F8 developer conference held yesterday, the company introduced 4 major updates. The biggest updates were revealed for Messenger: Facebook has created a marketplace for bots. The social media giant is also betting big on virtual reality using its Oculus Rift platform and on enterprise networking with Facebook Workplace platform. Below is a lowdown Messenger updates Almost a year after opening Messenger bots to developers, Facebook is now adding more functionalities to its chat app. The company says that Messenger can now be used as a Telephone directory for finding new users and as a digital Yellow Pages book for finding new businesses and services. Here is how Facebook plans to do it: Discover tab: On the home screen of the Messenger app, a new discover tab will allow users to browse through bots, pages, companies, products, nearby places and events, News, etc. The ‘bot store’ feature is being rolled out in the US as of now. Any developer can add their own customized messenger bots to the platform. Messenger codes: The Messenger app now allow businesses and individuals to generate ‘parametric QR codes’. Whenever a Facebook users scans these QR codes, it will redirect them to a web page, an event page, etc. Messenger QR codes can also be customized for events like sporting games, concerts, etc. Advertisement Chat extensions: With this feature, users can invoke messenger bots within chat conversations—something which Google’s Allo has been doing using its Google Assitant feature. For example, within a chat conversation or a group, a Messenger user can share music tracks using the Spotify bot. The other users clicking on the music track will be redirected to the Spotify music bot within Messenger itself. Suggestions from M assistant and gaming: Facebook’s M assistant which was first released in November 2015 now gets directly integrated into Messenger app. Users can set reminders, make payments to other users, suggest tasks/businesses, order food, etc. The feature is currently available for US users only. There is also a new game tab for US users within messenger with support for multiplayer games. Updates on Workplace Facebook’s enterprise networking platform Workplace which was launched in October last year also gets some crucial updates. Workplace users can now share files, bots, compliance tools, etc. To start with, the platform will have file-sharing integration with Microsoft Office, Salesforce, etc. for quicker sharing. Files shared will have a thumbnail pic with description and a comments section—something which seems to be borrowed from Slack. Workplace will also have support for messenger bots. For example, the @repairbot can be used by a company’s employees to alert the maintenance team or a bot to remind employees about the daily work schedule. (Source: TechCrunch) The company claims to have already onboarded more than 1000 organisations worldwide who collectively have created 100,000 groups on the service as of October 2016. Top 5 countries using Workplace includes India, Norway, US, UK and France.  AR Studio for developers Facebook is now opening its augmented reality platform to developers. Developers can now employ image recognition technology to create camera effects, designs, code-driven animations, etc. The AR Studio is an augmented reality based development environment with features like face-tracking, 3D rendering, scripted effects among others. “With it, you can design effects that respond to motion, gestures, facial expressions and more,” the company said. These effects were introduced last month on Messenger and on the Facebook app, and resembles Snapchat’s well-known photo-filters. Facebook Spaces   The social media giant is betting big on Virtual Reality (VR) with its Facebook Spaces platform—a new VR app that allows users to hang-out with friends in a virtual environment. All users have their own customizable 3D avatar, and in order to use the Spaces, a user will require an Oculus Rift headset. A User can create a new chat room and invite more users. Once these users join the virtual space, they can perform actions like drawing in the air with a virtual marker, changing the VR background with 360-dgree photos, make video/phone calls via Messenger, etc. Note that the platform is currently in beta mode, while Facebook promises more updates in the future. 00 Related #Apps #developers #Facebook #Facebook F8 #Internet #messaging Related Facebook F8 roundup: Messenger as a platform, Parse for IoT and more After Google, Facebook debuts live location sharing on Messenger WhatsApp hits 900 million active users globally Google’s Instant Apps is now available to developers for beta testing Facebook opens bot development on Messenger; are apps irrelevant?

The company has also tied up with Airtel for providing 100 GB of data free to Airtel home users purchasing a Fire TV Stick. YOU Broadband subscribers will also get up to 240GB free data usage with 3 months validity. Note that Airtel has also tied up with Netflix for integrating video streaming onto its DTH boxes. Additionally, customers purchasing Fire TV Stick by May 31, 2017, will receive a ₹499 cash back to their Amazon Pay balance when they register for a Prime account. With this launch, the company is addressing a major gap in its Amazon Prime Video service: prior to the launch of the device, users had no option to view Amazon Prime Video on their TV sets. Apart from Sony TVs, Amazon doesn’t have Prime Video apps for any smart TVs, and has consciously avoided providing applications to competing devices like Roku and Chromecast. In comparison, Netflix, Hotstar, Gaana etc are available on whichever platform that users want them. However, a device playing Amazon Prime Video can still be cast to a device which accepts casting: I’ve done that with Amazon Prime on a Roku. Thus, Amazon Prime Video, especially with its fairly limited (but reasonably priced) content library, is not reason enough to buy Fire TV Stick, even though it is the only one of two (the other being a remote, which Roku also has), since all the other apps are available on most other platforms anyway. Advertisement Moreover, despite there having been comparisons with Google’s Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV Stick is no Chromecast: Fire TV Stick requires apps to be installed on it, in order to be played. Chromecast more than just a device: it allows users to cast apps, audio and video from their laptops, desktops and mobile phones to TV screens and speakers, which gives it a much larger scope than what Amazon Fire TV Stick allows: mirroring of a screen (which Chromecast also allows). In addition, there’s a massive ecosystem that Google has, of Chromecast enabled apps which allow streaming of music, news, and now with Google Assistant, the ability to search and play content and use services, with services and devices talking to each other. Outside of the Google services ecosystem, there’s a large base of developers enabling casting to Chromecast/casting enabled devices. Chromecast is more of a protocol. Amazon’s appears to be a more tightly controlled ecosystem, and while it is going in the same direction with Alexa, it’s not lost on us that Echo and Amazon Fire TV Stick don’t yet talk to each other. There is a Fire TV Stick remote with Alexa enabled, but to me, that seems to be the only advantage it has over Chromecast: the phone has other uses beyond controlling what is being cast, and we’re a multi-screen-multi-tasking generation. Still, given how aggressive Amazon is being in India, I won’t be surprised if Echo and/or Echo dot are launched in India before the year is out, while Google takes its own sweet time launching Home. Amazon is bullish in India Amazon has also been investing heavily in India; it recently received a wallet license from the RBI and has already diversified its business into sectors like grocery delivery, Video, and payments. Its core business segment, ecommerce, is already leading the market in terms of sales with a GMV of above $300 million as of August 2016, according to Forbes. In India, Amazon has invested close to Rs 2010 crore, with an overall commitment of Rs 7,000 crore in FY16. Speaking at a recent call with analysts, the company’s CFO Brian Olsavsky said “It (India) is still very early (market)… We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it’s delivery, whether it’s seller features. We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We’re bullish on India longer-term and it’s early.” Globally, Amazon’s net profit stood at $749 million in Q4 2016, up 197.2% from $252 million the preceding quarter and 55% from $482 million in the same quarter last year.

As far as I understand​ it. Its a very stupid Device that requires you to essentially broadcast everything from a Phablet. Where as the Fire / Android – Apple TV, Devices are all self contained, and can also handle direct streaming from such a Phablet Device if needs be. Either by Miracast, or Airplay. In the case of AndroidTV… Even Chromecast. But outside of Chromecast for Audio. Could someone please explain the value of Chromecast over say a Shield TV… Without bringing up that old Chestnut of price. Yes we all know the Chromecast is like 1/4 (or even less), of a Shield TV. That is not the answer I either need or want. Essentially the header of this Article (it would seem), intimates that the Fire TV fails at not being a Chromecast. Where as to me this would be an obvious plus.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! TheScientists I'm kind of amazed someone hasn't already done this. It's the most basic of necessary functionality in an 'assistant'. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ So after posting this yesterday I looked into it, and sadly there's still no official API for creating reminders, and surprisingly no one has made an unofficial one either. So then I extracted the Inbox APK and decompiled it, I'm working my way through the code to see if I can't start pinning something down, but I'm betting they'll release actual support before I manage to do that. TheScientists Kudos to you, sir. I would have thought there would be something of note in the Google app apk? Or maybe some 1/2-assed way to do it via IFTTT. And, no, I wouldn't take that bet. Google is in no rush to do anything. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The problem is that the decompiled source doesn't exactly come across in a way that makes perfect sense. If a Java class isn't named in the manifest, it ends up getting somewhat obfuscated by proguard, so instead of seeing something like ReminderBuilder I end up with something named C12345, and even the classes are built in such a way that an object ends up being built up through multiple classes instead of just in a singular method, so it's complicated. I did look into IFTTT as well yesterday hoping for a quick solution but was disappointed. We'll see how far I get before either finding some options or just giving up out of frustration. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. dcdttu Once you can distinguish between users isn't all you need for reading/writing appointments....you've got to actually code that process, too. That's likely what they're doing now. So far in my testing at my house, it's quite good at knowing the different voices in our household. I wouldn't see their lack of confidence being a problem, honestly, because before the multi-user features were enabled, you could get personal information off Google Home for one user. Adding more than one user, even if it's giving the info to the wrong person, doesn't seem to be any worse. pfmiller My assumption was that they already have the code for writing data to their services since it's already done in every other application. That part of the problem isn't exactly novel. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! Jimjames Esson Well said,, Google to me ,if i have a Rheumotolgy appointment i simply use Google Calendar..!! Easy peasy lemon sqeasy..lol Blake What's an SRE? M6 https://landing.google.com/sre/ Petr Faitl I highly suspect that the answer is a highly political. No doubt it's product managers who can't agree with privacy gurus to prevent a few pranksters (i.e. one's kids) adding events to your calendar. abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Lars Jeppesen Who cares mustbepbs I do, because when I want to add a few minutes to a kitchen timer, I have to cancel the current one and create a new one with the new time. Kitchen timers from fuckin Dollar General have this "feature". abc He does. As he just said. Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. Ryan Music, pairing it with Smartthings to be a home controller, etc. I USED to use it for my shopping list, which was great. But they broke that function just recently. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. Lars Jeppesen I love mine - I'm sorry you can't figure out why it could be useful. Ryan I got mine on discount, so that helped. But I use it as a voice control for my smart-home features and to play music. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget... A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk— Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 trickytree1984 Support for exchange calendars is just as important. Most of the world don't use one personal Google calendar for their work and home life Navarr Barnier I'm assuming that MU was a blocker ticket, and they just pushed it out as quickly as they could - so reminders and appointments would be a WIP now that the blocker is out of the way. Surely.. right? right? Jonathan Sorry, but I just don't care about not having this feature, and I don't think many average users do either. But it wouldn't be a post about the Home if AP didn't gripe about it! Ryan Id use it daily, just like how I used the shopping list daily. Its a pretty basic feature that most people use (which is apparently by the unlimited competing choices for calendar and todo apps). Jonathan I agree that it's a basic feature that seems simple enough to execute and should have been implemented from the start​. I just don't think that many people are clamoring for it in their Bluetooth speaker outside of the AP sphere. And it's just getting silly and petty that the AP writers mention it in 95% of the articles they write​ about it. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The Home isn't just some Bluetooth speaker. It's SUPPOSED to be an assistive device that currently doesn't do the most basic tasks. I set reminders constantly across my phone, my watch, and in my car. It drives me crazy that I still can't do this on what is marketed as being the flagship device for Google Assistant. Ryan Or place items in Keep, like it used to be able to do. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I would love to be able to add items to ANY list in Keep. When my wife and I organize parties we use shared lists in Keep and it would be great to just add things as we talk about them. Stephen Cunningham I cant' get over Google taking the shopping list out of Keep. They are walking backwards not forward. I was hoping you would be able to add to any Keep list or add a note to Keep. Mike Jones i would like to add calendar appointments and i would like to add another minute to a timer too but that doesn't kill Home for me. i have a lot of home automation and i get a ton of use out of that. i just had a scare the other night where i thought i heard something in my house right as i was getting into bed. "google turn on the lights" and my house lit up like daytime.... it made it simple to check out the house.

John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering have left the company for a new hardware team at Apple which reports to Greg Duffy, co-founder of Dropcam. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. It's speculated that Apple could be looking to expand into satellite design and operation. One use for such technology would be a broadband service that could reach users who don't currently have Internet connectivity. It's also speculated that the executives could be working on a system to help Apple better collect mapping data, perhaps via the use of drones. Notably, rumors have suggested that Apple may be funding Boeing's V-band development work. Boeing has proposed a constellation of between 1,396 and 2,956 V-band satellites in 35-74 orbital planes at 1,200 km in altitude. The endeavor would create a global broadband system that would provide a wide range of advanced telecommunications services for commercial and governmental users.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Google to Build An Ad Blocker Into Chrome: Report Haamiz Ahmed 2 days ago Following in Opera’s footsteps, Google is going to include their own ad blocker in Chrome. This was reported by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) which further stated that the ad blocker will be on by default in the popular web browser. Counterintuitive? It seems ironic as the search engine relies on ads for the majority of its revenue. The company made north of $60 billion through online ads in 2016. According to WSJ, Google is going to target specific kind of ads including pop-ups, auto-playing video and audio advertisements. If Chrome blocks the annoying kind of ads itself, users won’t need to get a 3rd party ad blocker. Google does not agree with making deals with the likes of Ad Block Plus to whitelist their own ads from their browser extension. Another reason for making their own ad block is a large number of users using Google Chrome. Most Popular Browser in The World Chrome is the most popular browser in the world and took the crown from the infamous Internet Explorer in 2016. It boasted a 56% market share compared with 21% of Internet Explorer. If that user base does not need to go for a 3rd party ad blocker and Google gets to show its own ads, it will be a win-win for both. Acceptable ads could gain traction which would benefit other advertisers as well. Not Confirmed Yet Of course, this kind of plan isn’t flawless by any means. Google is an advertiser and a major one at that. This would draw criticism from industry peers and antitrust watchdog organizations alike. WSJ says that it’s not really a done deal at this point but if Google does go ahead with it, it is going to break the news within the next few weeks.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares88 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Syukri Lajin Google doesn't backup call history and sms. that's the only shitty part i have to complain about. JohnyNoLegs It does do SMS 100% as i just restored from a reset. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Killa Can you head into your Google Drive and look at the Backups for your Pixel? Is each content type separated out...like text, call history, etc.? Impulse_Vigil I'm not seeing it on the mobile app, dunno if it's visible on desktop or the site, or if they just hide it somehow... The settings page does say Drive tho, it's kinda weird. Not even sure whether they're counting this towards one's Google account storage or what. Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Chang Hi, I posted this, but it got kicked to bottom of thread. So, here it is again. Hope it is some help. Gen. Chang • 43 minutes ago Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Xchris Big deal. Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, that's one of you so far. Impulse_Vigil You polled Pixel users huh? abc "The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites" That's just sad for Android then. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7. Hexlattice On slower internet speeds, Photos has a really hard time trying to backup larger files... Normally, getting on a faster network will fix the problem, but if the files are old enough, it's like Photos gives up on trying and I end up having some videos never backup :( abc Pixel problems? https://i.imgflip.com/h8wog.jpg?a414600 Gen.

Praneeth Kancherla They have been looking into it from past few months. Backups on my Pixel XL never worked. I've contacted support through chat option on the phone and all information I got at the end is Google is aware of this issue,actively working on fixing it and fix will be available soon. It looks meaning of soon is certainly different​ in Google's dictionary. Lately my phone has developed so much lag even while doing simple tasks like using keyboard in any app, browsing internet and settings. Google support is okay to replace my device after verifying warranty but cannot ship replacement first even if I'm okay with hold on my credit card for full amount and covering shipping charges. They say replacement may take anytime from 7-10 business days and I need to buy another phone. The reason they quote is I'm not the original buyer. But they were able to verify and confirm that it's​ still under warranty. They are okay with honoring the warranty but not willing to ship replacement first even if I'm okay with covering charges that may incur in doing that. All these issues for $750 smartphone and they taking months to resolve issues without any possible workaround is just terrible in my opinion. I'll still use Pixel and Android as I like them compared to Apple and its ecosystem but I feel Google is certainly not doing enough to retain consumers like me.

Voice assistants are everywhere. They're in our phones, speakers, washing machines, and now, cars. Mercedes-Benz has announced that both Alexa and Google Assistant will work on all of its 2016 and 2017 models released in the US. Apart from a compatible car, you will need an active Mercedes Me account and a subscription to mbrace, Mercedes' smartphone platform in the US that costs $199 a year after a six-month free trial. Google Home review: Better than Amazon Echo? What is Google Assistant and how does it work? 7 best Google Home compatible devices you can buy today So, starting 21 April, owners of newer Mercedes can command their Google Home or Amazon Echo to remotely start or lock their vehicles. They can also send addresses to their in-car nav system. In its announcement, Mercedes explained how the integration works: "Customers with Google devices can simply say, 'Ok, Google, tell Mercedes me to start my car,' and it will remotely start the customer’s car. Another available feature includes remote lock. With Alexa devices, customers can say, 'Alexa, ask Mercedes me to send an address to the car' for remote navigation input and point-of-interest requests." And here's a promo video that shows the integration in action: Mercedes first revealed that in December 2016 that it would soon support Google Assistant on Google Home. The company has also said that Europe will get these same features in the near future.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Boeing laid out a plan to provide broadband internet access through over 1,000 low-earth orbiting satellites in a 2016 regulatory filing, and a source “familiar with the matter” told Bloomberg that Apple spoke with the aerospace company about coming an investor-partner in the project. Further, TMF Associates satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar wrote in a recent blog post that industry insiders said Boeing’s project was being funded by Apple at the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. Farrar noted that a Wall Street Journal article reported that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025, showing the potential of the field. One of the major lures for tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook to develop broadband internet is to tap into the large demographic of people who don’t yet have internet access, notes Bloomberg. Facebook has long espoused this goal. The report also states that Apple might be putting its satellite experts to work on something else closely related — such as drones or near space technology like high bandwidth radio transceivers or high-altitude balloons. Whatever it is, however, likely has its home in the sky.

That would be a pretty damn big deal for an autonomous vehicle network to have access to a dedicated and higher accuracy network of positioning sats. TrickyDickie We’ll have to wait and see on the accuracy lol But it would be impressive. And within their mantra of controlling all aspects of their stuff. It’s Me true enough. But if it is only as accurate as the existing and publicly accessible GPS network, I don’t see Apple wanting to invest tens of billions of dollars to have their own. Controlling their own systems and supplies is important but only when their is some type of advantage. Boeing isn’t exactly new to the aerospace business.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 376 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares557 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here.

Earth Day Google doodle offers up conservation tips to help save the planet Google is using today's doodle to promote conservation efforts and support the World Wildlife Fund, The Ocean Agency, and The Jane Goodall Institute. Amy Gesenhues on April 21, 2017 at 5:52 pm More While the official date for Earth Day is April 22, Google has posted its 2017 Earth Day Google doodle a day early. To celebrate this year’s Earth Day, the Google doodle team has created a slide show of animated images reminiscent of a children’s book. Designed by doodler Sophie Diao, the illustrations tell the story of a fox dreaming about a world with polluted oceans and suffering through the adverse impact of climate change. Upon waking, the fox begins to make small changes during his day that lead to greater energy-conservation efforts. Google shared the following sketches of the doodle in its early stages: Clicking the search icon on the doodle leads to a search for “Earth Day tips” and surfaces an interactive tool that includes a collection of Earth Day tips, along with information about the conservation efforts currently underway by the World Wildlife Fund, The Ocean Agency and The Jane Goodall Institute. “Today, we honor the rich, vast Earth that’s sustained generations before us and continues to nurture life and inspire wonder,” writes the Google Doodle team on its blog, “At an estimated 4.543 billion years of age, the Earth is still the only known object in the Universe known to harbor life.” Google’s Earth Day doodle is being shared across the globe — posted on its US and international home pages.

Name: Subject: Message: Google removes fake “System Update” app from Play Store Newsby John Callaham1 day ago 22 1752 61 Even though the Google Play Store is by far the safest place to download apps for your Android smartphone or tablet, there’s always the danger of installing one that is not what it claims to be. Recently, Google removed such an app from the Play Store that was labeled as “System Update”. In fact, the app was spyware that had been downloaded millions of times in the past few years. See also: Best security apps for Android 2 weeks ago The security firm Zscaler claims it discovered that this “System Update” app, which first launched in 2014, was spyware that sent data about a device’s location to whomever created the app. It also can look at certain incoming SMS messages. The security firm says that if a user installed and tried to use the app, it would appear to quit working and show the message, “Unfortunately, Update Service has stopped.” In fact, there is evidence the app would continue to work in the background. The firm alerted Google to this fake app, and the company has since removed it from the Play Store, but not before the listing’s page indicated it had been downloaded between 1 million and 5 million times. It goes without saying that all Android device owners should be careful when downloading any app from the Play Store. In this case, there were clues that “System Update” was a fake. There were no screenshots posted in its Play Store listing, and there was no proper description of the app. Finally, written reviews in the listing were highly negative, as many users stated the app didn’t work.

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 80 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares176 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month.

Google Maps v9.49 beta adds a manual parking location tracker, weather indicator for mass transit navigation, and more [APK Download + Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/03/18 10:49am PDTMar 18, 2017 113 Plus 1 on G+ 123 Share on Facebook 88 Share on Twitter Total Shares324 Android Auto APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Save your parking location 1.2 Weather in mass transit navigation 1.3 Updated arrival screen on Android Auto 2 Teardown 2.1 Sort your searches 3 Download It's always good to see useful new features in the apps we use often, and Google Maps rarely fails to bring something new with every update. The latest bump to v9.49 is no different. This release adds a few new toys for users to enjoy. There's a new capability to manually save your parking location so it's easier to get back to your car, weather predictions for your destinations while setting up navigation, and more. There's even a quick teardown that shows search results will soon support sorting. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Save your parking location along with notes, pictures, and expiry reminders Notification toggle for mass transit station notifications Weather predictions at destination New arrival screen on Android Auto Save your parking location Google has spent the last couple of years working on fine-tuning a system that will try to accurately detect when you finish driving and remember where you parked. While it's definitely helpful, it's not entirely reliable and doesn't do much to make multi-level parking structures any easier. However, the latest version adds a feature to save your parking location for easy reference. To access this handy tool, you'll have to tap on the blue dot that indicates your current location. This pops up a menu with the command to save your parking. Tapping on it will instantly record your location and place it on the map. From here, you can look at the detail page and manually adjust the location, add notes to describe things like the parking level or lot/row numbers, set a time limit, and add photos. There's even a share button if you want to let somebody else know where your car is located. When you're ready to return to your car, you can find the saved location in your notifications or at the top of the suggestions on the search screen in Google Maps. Being able to add notes and photos is obviously helpful in certain situations, and it's enough to make this feature useful. But it also includes a field where you can set a time limit. This is clearly intended for use with situations like metered street parking and time-limited spaces. The time limit will even count down to show how long until it expires, or how long it has been expired. If you're not interested in getting notifications about time limits that are about to expire, you can switch them off in Settings. This is a pretty great feature and allows for manual control, which matters quite a bit considering Google's automatic detection can be off by as much as a couple of blocks sometimes. The one problem that stands out to me is that you can only ever set one parking location at a time. This means you're probably not going to be able to leave your car in long-term parking at the airport, fly somewhere else, then keep track of the location of your rental car. Maybe this will be remedied at some point in the future, but in the meantime, Google Keep remains a pretty good stand-in. Weather in mass transit navigation Google Maps is a multi-facetted tool and packs quite a bit of information into every screen, but the v9.49 update might add just a little bit extra when you're planning to travel. Some users have reported seeing a new weather indicator while preparing navigation. There are a couple of odd things about this weather report. To begin with, it seems to only show up while planning trips on mass transit, not with any of the other forms of conveyance. On top of that, it shows weather at your current location, not at the destination, which flies in the face of most methods of travel. I have a theory that may explain this. Since most types of public transportation involve at least some period of time standing outside waiting for a train, bus, or car to come along, it might help to give people a reminder of what conditions they'll be standing in. The weather indicator doesn't seem to be available for all users yet, so you may not see this immediately. Updated arrival screen on Android Auto Android Auto users haven't been forgotten, there's a new arrival screen appearing for some. This change was first reported last week with v9.48, but again, it doesn't seem to be live for everybody. (I didn't have it on v9.48, and I've been too sick to try it since.) The new arrival card somewhat resembles the updated version that came with v9.45 early last month, which includes trip duration, distance, and average speed in a single row. For reference, the previous version is included below. – Thanks Craig and Mike. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Sort your searches Most standard searches in Google Maps will yield some pretty satisfactory results. The list of possible destinations will be sorted based on how long it would take to reach each one from your current location – and that's probably how most of us actually want it to work. However, there are also times when we're surrounded by places that show up in a search, but aren't actually what we're looking for. It looks like the Maps app might allow us to refine the search experience a bit by changing the sorting method. <string name="SEARCH_SORT_BY">Sort by</string> <string name="SEARCH_SORT_RELEVANCE">Relevance</string> There's obviously not much to say here since there are only two strings and they spell it out pretty clearly. There's going to be an option to change sorting methods, and at this time, the only option mentioned is relevance. I would expect travel time and distance to be added to the list, and possibly a few others. It's not clear yet if the sorting options will appear in the screen for setting more filters or in another location.

PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Must.integrate.Waze.into.Android Auto.now. KChristainsen Nothing new on Google plus location integration? Bala kumar Speedometer and Speed Limit are two much needed features which are still missing ... whispy_snippet A speedometer isn't needed because every car already provides this. It's redundant info that would only clutter the app's UI. A speed limit indicator is a different matter though. I'd love to see this added. Bala kumar Speed limits are also there in the Road signs and won't required in the app, you mean? It is not that the speedometer is there in the car or not. What would you say, if I'm a co-passenger and like to see the speedometer? Why not? whispy_snippet Road signs are only visible as you pass them whereas a car's speed is always visible. This is stating the obvious. Adding a second speedometer to a car is pointless and just adds clutter and another possibility for distraction. If the passenger wants to see the speed of the car they only need to look at the driver's speedo. Adding a speed limit indicator, however, makes sense because it's very easy to miss a speed limit sign. Having the speed limit always visible is helpful. Having two displays of a car's current speed is not. ekerazha GPS-based speedometer is more accurate. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I agree, sometimes when you change roads, you dont see the Road signs anywhere near you, that happens very often in rural-country roads or when it's dark at night and the signs roads are difficult to spot. GPS-based speedometer is very handy in those mentioned situation, besides, another handy feature is you can set up an audible alert is you pass the speed limit which happens more often that we want. Pessimippopotamus It's handy, but you *should* be paying attention to roadside signage all the time instead of relying on a nav app anyway. I wonder if Google won't put it in the app on purpose because if one speed limit is off, then they'd be in a potential legal trouble. Yuri Vidal How to Register for beta? andy_o Hmm I didn't realize Android Auto in cars already had an arrival screen. Been wishing for that in the standalone app for a while now. Hopefully with the wide rollout of the new one it will come to it as well, and the parking functionality, which for now I have to open Maps manually for. drvadlamudi Still waiting for the migration of the location sharing function to maps. waloody88 Wow unreal. After all the bloat streak something good was finally added. Few more useful features and i may enable Google maps again. p g 2 things I would like to see in maps.. as a truck driver.. first low clearance over passes or restricted roads. Also I agree with another person that posted about road speed limits. Signage ain't always that great. dariusmoss how long has maps been remembering your settings when choosing to avoid tolls or highways? because i just noticed that FINALLY being implemented andy_o I just noticed it today too. There's another person in the Maps Google product forums that reported it too. Must be the feature update of the decade for Google, and no one's reporting it! whispy_snippet I really do love Google Maps. An absolute day to day essential. A true game changer that never stops getting better. Cecil Hardwood Love me some Google Maps and this feature is nice. I like the option to take a photo and notes about your parking spot. Nice job Google. pfmiller I use Valet for parking, and the ability to automatically remember your location when you disconnect from your cars Bluetooth is brilliant. patkoscsaba Hmm... I have this version installed, but I don't see the parking option. Is it location related? andy_o Not sure if others still have it, but for me it was disabled after a day or so. Probably server-side switch. Dharshan Wimal Hi, I saw am a Sri Lankan guy where a I saw a Sri Lankan app which has the similar feature that is going to be released on the google map.
