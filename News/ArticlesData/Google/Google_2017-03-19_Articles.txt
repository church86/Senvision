"I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Google executive Matt Brittin said at an industry conference in London on Monday. "We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously." Several major companies and ad agencies have pulled their ads from Google and YouTube in recent days after a newspaper investigation showed their product pitches were being displayed on content including videos from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The British government said last week that it would temporarily restrict its advertising on the company's platforms. It has been joined by The Guardian, Marks & Spencer and French marketing giant Havas, which represents clients including O2 and Royal Mail. Related: Google is going to start showing you more ads Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) own huge chunks of the digital advertising business, and brands are spending an increasing share of their ad budgets on their platforms. Like other tech firms, Google relies on users to report inappropriate content posted to its platforms. Flagged content is then reviewed -- a process that Google says takes less than 24 hours in 98% of cases. But the company admits it needs to do better. Brittin said that Google would set a higher standard for videos and sites against which advertisements appear. He also said that brands would be given more control over where their ads appear. "We are looking at accelerating changes to policy controls and enforcement that will help us to do better," he said. "We need to improve and we will do." Related: Google's Europe boss doesn't know what he is paid Martin Sorrell, CEO of the global advertising firm WPP (WPPGF), said that Google must do more. "We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company," he said. "They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements." At least one market analyst has downgraded shares in Google from "buy" to "hold" over the issue. "We think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions," said Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group. "Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero tolerance policy." -- Nina dos Santos contributed to this article.

(Seeking Alpha) Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was slapped with a rare downgrade on Monday as Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser lowered his rating on the stock to Hold from Buy with a price target lowered to $950 from a previous $970 due to ongoing concerns in the United Kingdom. According to U.K.-based Daily Mail, several notable local brands, including retail giant Marks & Spencer, are no longer going to advertise on Google's YouTube platform. Companies have concerns that their brand image is being shown alongside content from extremist channels and groups, including neo-Nazi and even jihadist groups. Global Repercussions According to Wieser, Alphabet's Google unit faces brand safety issues in the United Kingdom, but this can have global repercussions. The analyst expanded that ad quality and brand safety represent the biggest issues facing the advertising agency. In addition, advertisers are effectively putting money in the pockets of terror and extremist groups. Google has since apologized and pledged to fix the problem by improving controls it gives advertisers and working faster to remove hateful content. However, Wieser argued that the approach isn't enough to remedy concerns. "The approach comes across to us as attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it, which is the standard we think that many large brand advertisers expect," the analyst argued. "We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover." Bottom Line The analyst also suggested that U.K. marketers could expand their local boycott of advertising on Google's platform to other global markets which prompted the analyst to lower his full-year revenue estimate for Alphabet by one percent point. In addition, Wieser noted that Alphabet's recent run up now puts the stock well within the 15 percent band he uses to justify a Buy rating.

Ron Amadeo - Mar 20, 2017 2:49 pm UTC reader comments 75 Share this story Park the car, press the blue dot, and save your current position. Swipe the card up and add photos, notes, and a timer or change the location. You'll get a notification about your parking spot. If you hate this feature, you can turn it off. Google Maps quietly added a sweet new feature that will help you remember where you parked. Just park your car, open up Google Maps, and tap on the blue location dot. You'll be presented with a new menu offering to "save your parking," which lets you store all the information you need to find your car again. The new interface will save your current location and slap a big "P" icon on the map. This wouldn't be enough for a multistory parking garage, though, so you can bring up a new interface that lets you save a ton of information. You can adjust the dot location, add photos to your parking spot, and type notes. If there's a parking meter, you can even set a "time left" field that will count down the time remaining. After filling out this info, Google Maps will spawn a notification reminding you that you have a saved parking location. The notification and the "P" icon on Google Maps will stick around until you open the parking information and hit "clear " or until you save a different parking spot. This new "parking saving" feature is a lot better than Google's last attempt, which existed in Google Now. Now would try to automatically guess when you parked via Android's "activity recognition system" (it looked at the GPS and marked down where you hit 0 mph). It kind of worked, but it required way too much trust in Google's magical algorithms for something as critical as a parking reminder. Purely GPS-based parking saving was also useless in those big parking garages, where GPS doesn't work and won't tell you what level you are on. This new proactive version lets you store all that extra info and gives you the peace of mind knowing that the information will actually be there when you get back. For now, the new feature seems to be working only on Android Google Maps v9.49. There are almost no feature differences between the iOS and Android versions of Google Maps, though, so we'd imagine it will hit iOS once the new version successfully navigates the app store's update process.

A digital marketing CEO’s prescription to cure advertising fraud As the threat of ad fraud continues to loom over digital marketers, columnist James Green lays out the ingredients we need to promote transparency and drive the industry forward. James Green on March 20, 2017 at 10:27 am More Challenges around viewability, media metrics and transparency in the advertising inventory supply chain have festered for more than a decade, and they’ve recently hit a fever pitch. We see marketers increasingly demanding accountability for their digital media spends and looking for transparent and standard metrics to support digital advertising effectiveness. They’re fed up with ad fraud and waste in the supply chain — and so am I. A wake-up call was issued by Procter & Gamble’s chief brand officer in late January at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Annual Leadership meeting. Marc Pritchard, marketing leader of the world’s biggest advertiser, lambasted the digital ad industry for creating poor experiences for consumers, and highlighted media and tech giants Facebook and Google for lack of transparency on the performance of campaigns on their platforms, along with uneven inventory quality. Pritchard asserted that he doesn’t “want to waste time and money on a crappy media supply chain” and urged the industry to fix issues his company has been demanding for over a year. Undeterred, at an Association of National Advertiser meeting in February, he took up the issue again. When a behemoth like P&G talks, its impact as a change agent isn’t likely to be ignored. Most recently, Pritchard said Facebook and Google’s agreement to submit to audits by the Media Rating Council is not enough, and that agencies must offer more transparency around audit results. My reaction to Pritchard’s charges? Good for him — and for us. The more we all rally around change in a complicated and fast-moving industry, the better. Here’s another smoldering issue: Brand marketers’ ads are increasingly being served up on inflammatory media websites like Breitbart News. There is a striking lack of, or ineffectiveness of, safeguards for brands that need to know where their ads are running. Marketers want their ads running in “brand-safe” and contextually relevant environments, but when buying ads on open exchanges, there are no guarantees where the ads will run. According to a New York Times article, investment advisory firm Vanguard was clued into its ads showing up on Breitbart, not by its advertising agency but by a client. Not exactly the kind of call Vanguard was hoping for. As CEO of a company with a marketing platform for ad, email and site personalization, I’ve had a front-row seat to these issues as they’ve unfolded in our industry. I’ve also experienced endless “the buck stops with me” moments while trying to face head-on the challenges of this complex industry. So, here’s my “prescription” to move us forward: Ingredient One: What’s our version of the Lemon Law? If you’ve ever bought a car and encountered persistent problems caused by the manufacturer, you’re likely familiar with a law on the books in the US called the “Lemon Law.” This legislation is intended as a remedy for purchasers who, by no fault of their own, purchased a defective product. I am not proposing a Lemon Law per se, but a way to legitimately address a brand’s concern over paying for a “defective” advertising campaign (i.e., you shouldn’t pay for an ad that isn’t seen). Instead, the advertising industry hides behind the “contractual clause” excuse or complicated jargony explanations Pritchard rails against. Specifically, sellers of media need to be responsible for the ads they sell, and that should trickle down from the top to the bottom of the value chain. Thus, if I sell an inappropriate ad impression to an agency or brand, they shouldn’t pay for it. But if I bought that impression from an ad exchange, then I shouldn’t pay for that impression. And then, of course, the ad exchange shouldn’t pay the original seller. That is not how it works today. If I buy an ad, and an agency says it’s not viewable, I don’t get the revenue, and I still pay for the purchase, which means the seller still makes money. When the seller is selling fraud, that’s just not right, and it encourages more bad behavior. Ingredient Two: Be our own change agents and agree to universal standards When I look at what’s happening around the world and here in the US as people vie for change, I see action, not talk. Grassroots initiatives are popping up everywhere to push for change. In politics, we see people putting a stake in the ground defining non-negotiable issues. More people are preparing to run for local or state elected office having never served before. Indeed, we have a president who was elected at least in part because millions of people felt forgotten and wanted a revolution rather than more of the same. I’m hoping that we’ll see similar enthusiasm in our industry. We should be the ones to drive change, not be driven by it. This needs to start with agreeing to viewability standards, rather than opining on why they won’t work. P&G is adopting the MRC standard. It may not be perfect, but it’s a start. Our industry has evolved dramatically over decades — and so can our standards, so long as we define them. Ingredient Three: Consensus-driven industry guidelines and individual ethics We need consensus-driven industry guidelines and must adhere to an “honor code” of sorts to responsibly regulate ourselves within the industry. Every person, no matter what function or title, can live up to this honor code. What stops one from making an unethical choice? Generally, it’s our individual moral compass. For example, our company sees and uses data on the way people behave and engage, but we made the decision not to collect data on medical status or history, or any personally identifiable financial information. It’s reasonable to think there are companies that could utilize this data, but we don’t believe it is ethically appropriate. This is in line with IAB guidelines. I am reminded of the Charles Dickens novel, “A Tale of Two Cities,” and its most famous line, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” It was, of course, the age of wisdom and “the best of times,” and yet at the same time it was the age of foolishness, “the worst of times.” We are lucky to be in an industry that reaps the benefits of imagination and rigor of data science. As an industry, we have come so far and have many great advancements ahead of us. We need a cure that encompasses industry-wide reform, or future foolishness will win out.

 Samsung says you'll be able to control the Galaxy S8 with just your voice Steve Kovach Mar. 20, 2017, 10:34 AM 5,951 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Samsung Galaxy S7. Flickr/Kārlis Dambrāns Samsung thinks phones are too hard to use. The answer? A digital assistant that lets you do everything with voice commands instead of poking, swiping, and tapping at your phone. It's a bold, unproven promise that Samsung says it's bringing to its next smartphone, the Galaxy S8. The new assistant is called Bixby, a sequel of sorts to S Voice, the voice-control app Samsung launched years ago but has since hidden on recent devices. In a blog post announcing Bixby, Samsung says the assistant will debut on still-unannounced Galaxy S8 and activate with a dedicated button. (It's also a little strange Samsung is pre-announcing a major feature of the Galaxy S8 over a week before it formally unveils the phone.) Samsung promises Bixby will let you control everything on your phone and Bixby-powered apps with your voice. In theory, talking to your device and telling it what you want will take away the need to learn how a new phone works. Samsung also says Bixby will be better at understanding natural language than rival digital assistants, so you won't have to memorize certain commands. The principle behind Bixby appears to be that phones have grown too complicated to use, therefore you need a more natural way to interact with the technology. It's the same concept being explored on screen-free devices like Amazon's Echo and Google Home, but hasn't really found its way to phones and computers yet. While you can control your iPhone with Siri and some Android phones with Google Assistant, it's still more natural to tap on the screen the old-fashioned way. Of course, it'll be impossible to judge how well Bixby works until we see the Galaxy S8 in person on March 29. The move also threatens to confuse users even more, now that all Android phones are getting Google's own Google Assistant. Plus, manufacturers like Motorola and Huawei are starting to build Amazon's Alexa assistant into some of their devices. So that's the real head-scratcher here. Instead of relying on Google's expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence, Samsung is going rogue with its own digital assistant. Bixby also sounds like it'll be extremely limited at first and will only work with some of Samsung's apps that come with the Galaxy S8. It's not a replacement for search or other information like Alexa or Google Assistant. Bixby appears to only let you control your phone, although more capabilities could be added in the future, thanks to Samsung's recent acquisition of the AI startup Viv. Eventually, Samsung plans to allow third-party app developers to enable Bixby in their apps, which will be tough for the company to do at scale. Historically, it's been hard to get developers to enable features in apps specific to just one device. For example, very few apps added features for Samsung's curved "edge" screens and Apple is still struggling to get developers to adopt the 3D Touch pressure-sensitive screen on newer iPhone models. Good luck convincing developers to enable Bixby commands if they only work on one phone. Samsung also says it plans to expand Bixby to all of its connected devices, from smart washing machines to connected TVs, a clear play against Alexa, which is already popping up in a variety of connected devices like robot vacuums and even Ford cars.  SEE ALSO: Google says the voice ads on Google Home aren't really ads NOW WATCH: Here's everything we know so far about Samsung's new Galaxy S8 Loading video...

Register Advertise Follow Subscribe to MAD London Commentary Google's Chickens Come Home To Roost In Its Toughest Week Ever by Sean Hargrave, Staff Writer, March 20, 2017 Money talks, everything else takes a walk. It's a common phrase often repeated with an expletive in the middle, but there is surely no better way of summing up what's happening with Google this week. If Brexit woes and Scottish Independence gave Theresa May a shocker of a week last week, this time it's Google's turn. Today its top guy in the UK, Matt Brittin, will be in the last place where he would choose as he delivers a speech to adland in London on the first day of Advertising Week. By the end of the week, a delegation is due to report back to the Cabinet Office on what the company is going to do to stop taxpayer-funded ad campaigns appearing next to extremist videos. The government has already suspended Google advertising and it will be looking for a good reason to resume.  As for adland, well, the list of agencies and brands that have dropped the tech giant is a veritable who's who of advertising. Havas has been the latest to join a boycott list alongside Publicis and WPP has written to its clients to ask whether they wish to drop Google too. Brands that have already taken aversive action themselves include, most recently, M&S, Vodafone, Sky, HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. They join a first wave of boycotters that included McDonald’s, L’Oréal, Audi, Sainsbury’s, Argos and the BBC. Ahead of Ad Week opening this week, Unilever refused to state its position on a boycott. The trouble is that Google has no friends here. Regular readers will know I've been pretty hard on Google over the years, but it's only to bring home the reality of how politicians, and now brands, feel about the tech giants. It can't be too surprised to find itself in an isolated position. Firstly, we have the long drawn-out saga of the EU antitrust case against it. Google has responded to a list of charges that it favours its own businesses in search and insists unfairly that its apps must be shipped pre-installed on an Android device. The defence was pretty much that it doesn't cause an imbalance between its business interests and serving its customers. Nobody is under any illusion that Google has a massive, punitive fine coming its way. My only question is whether by dragging this case out -- Google even got an extension on a previous deadline to defend itself -- has the tech giant made enough money from what it is accused of to pay the fine, anyway? The politicians are after Google, then, but not just for antitrust reasons. The elephant in the room whenever Google is mentioned is how it, just like Facebook and others, is managing to pay ridiculously low taxes by using every sophisticated trick in the book to make it appear as if money is not earned in the UK. If it was so squeaky clean you have to wonder why it recently agreed to pay GBP130m (including interest) to the Treasury in back taxes between 2005 and 2015. Industry estimates suggest that even with a conservative eye on the figures, Google would have made around GBP7bn profit over this period -- yet has now paid, including previously paid tax, around GBP200m. That works out at a tax rate of less than 3%. Even if you factor in contributions and payments to American staff, it would be hard to put Google at paying more than the equivalent of 5% tax in a country where corporation tax is 20%.   Google is due a bloodied nose and it's going to get one this week from adland which is fed up of it taking billions in revenue yet not policing its own back yard to ensure it is as brand safe and fraud free as possible. UK politicians will be relatively powerless in this other than to gratefully accept whatever Google deems appropriate in tax as it decides whether to put its budget back on YouTube.  The bigger blow will come from the EU at some stage this year -- and remember we said that last year too -- when a massive fine will be levied against them. But then consider this. Whatever the fine, you can bet your bottom dollar that Google has made way more money transgressing rules than the fine it may be asked to pay. It's also worth remembering that some analysts have even suggested Google makes more from the UK government in advertising than it pays in tax anyway. It's a hard figure to back up or refute, but the accusation certainly should tell Google everything it needs to know about how it is viewed in the UK and the wider EU. So governments can't do too much but put a stone chip in Google's bodywork that will take a few moments to fix. With Adland, however, that's a very different matter. Turn off the taps and Google will buckle. What's the betting by the end of the week they have suddenly happened upon a way of tackling fraud and ensuring brand safety? It can be fined all it wants, be hauled over the coals on tax -- but what really matters to Google is advertisers losing trust and withdrawing budget. The week ahead is the biggest that Google UK will have ever endured. brand image, google, government, london, politics, search, uk 1 comment about "Google's Chickens Come Home To Roost In Its Toughest Week Ever".

Next: All PayPal accounts were 1 click away from hijacking by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Remember back in 2013, when Ticketmaster – the world’s largest online ticket retailer – decided to stop torturing people’s eyeballs by making them decipher blobs of melted characters in order to prove that they’re human? Likewise, Google’s now too stabbing a fork into CAPTCHA, the aggravating test that’s supposed to determine if we’re robots or scripts used by spammers or other online misdeed-doers, or if we are instead real, live, warm-blooded simians. CAPTCHA came out of Carnegie Mellon University and stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”. The tests are designed to be hard for robots, easy for humans. They typically consist of typing letters and/or digits from a distorted image. Or, as the case may be, messages to go pleasure yourself. Or, then again, mathematical problems that make your brain bleed. Ten years into using CAPTCHA to keep robots from engaging in dirty tricks online, the “supposed to weed out bots” has now turned into “utterly stink at weeding out bots”. That’s because advances in Artificial Intelligence have resulted in robot creations that are now able to solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text with 99.8% accuracy, according to Google’s recent research. Not that Google’s going to stop testing site visitors to weed out bots, mind you. Rather, as it announced on Wednesday, Google’s going to move away from asking users to read blobby text and type it into a box, as it’s been doing, like this:  And instead will simply ask us, “Are you a robot?” with what it’s calling the “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” API, like so: Asking us to check off a box saying that “I am not a robot” will be an effective way of determining whether or not we’re robots because humans move their cursors in a humanlike way. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the Web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Wired quotes Shet: All of this gives us a model of how a human behaves It's a whole bag of cues that make this hard to spoof for a bot. He said that there are other variables that will help make the determination, but those have to be kept secret, lest botmasters figure out how to work around them and once again learn how to slip past Google’s filters. Google’s been integrating automated bot-detection into its CAPTCHAs since at least 2013. In October 2013, Google revealed that it had developed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA to filter out bots. The backend doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into the box. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we type into the box – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. On Valentine’s Day, Google gave us a taste of what reCAPTCHA can do, presenting us with chocolates and flowers and throbbing hearts – the first two of which were rendered in text that was simple (for humans) to read. It sounds great, but it’s not yet time to kiss the inscrutably distorted CAPTCHA blobs goodbye. Over the past week, Google’s tests on sites that use CAPTCHA have verified most humans, but it still missed quite a few. As Wired reports, about 60% of WordPress users and 80% of users at video game sales site Humble Bundle got past the CAPTCHA with only the simple checkbox. When Google’s Advanced Risk Analysis engine can’t figure out what we are with a mere click, it’s going to back up the test with a pop-up window that will present users with the same old distorted text we’ve been enduring for years. For mobile users, things haven’t gotten quite so simple as a single click. But when they face a CAPTCHA on their mobile phone or tablet, they’ll now have a much easier hurdle to leap: rather than having to type in text, they’ll be asked to select all the images that correspond with a clue image. Like Google says, it’s a lot easier to tap photos of cats or turkeys than to type in a line of text on a phone: And if you’re worried about the privacy implications of Google analyzing where your mouse moves on a page, Shet pointed out that Google will only be tracking your movements over the CAPTCHA widget when it appears on other sites, not on the entire page. This is how he put it to Wired: You don’t have to verify your identity to verify your humanity. Besides, as we’ve noted before, tracking movement is not just a Google thing. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super secret, privacy-sucking vampire sauce. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This is not news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It’s been around almost since the beginning of the web, and the web would be hurting without it, given the things it makes happen. Among the many features of the language are the abilities to track the position of your cursor, track your keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image. Think bots that harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, site scrapers that grab the content of websites and re-use it without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, bots that take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and more. I’ll take the kittens, please!

In the era where the mouse is becoming obsolete Google are going to rely on user mouse movements or clicks to define whether a person is human or not. There are some pretty big gaming communities that have been scripting human like mouse behavior for years. It’ll be interesting to see how this progresses.

Reply Paul Ducklin says: September 9, 2016 at 5:40 pm I thought a hamburger was called “a hamburger” in the US :-) By definition, of course, even in British English, a hamburger *is* a sandwich. At any rate, there seems to be no suggestion in any of the Oxford lexicons (British or American) that sandwiches can’t be circular. Two pieces of bread with an edible filling in between is all you need to pass the test. I guess the CAPTCHA folks were hoping a robot wouldn’t be able to handle the subtleties… Having said that, if you tried to order a hamburger by asking for “a sandwich” in Maccas, I think you would get, errrrrrrr, either a sandwich, served in the form of a square cut into two triangle, or a word from the security guard (depending on how strongly you argued the case, and whether it was after 1am).

I hate reCAPTCHA nevertheless. It’s based on assumptions that don’t work for the privacy and security conscious among us. First it’s embedded in an iframe. Something my content blocker will block by default. Second it’s heavily using scripts. Well, guess what … I have found myself solving more than half a dozen of these without being let in. And worse yet, when I resorted to solving the audio version there was a text that essentially told me I was a bot. Why thank you. So these CAPTCHAs literally fail at the one thing they are meant to achieve: tell computer and human apart. Wow. Just wow. Oh and the fact that many of these images where you have to guess are specific to the culture where they are taken doesn’t it make easier. Are traffic signs also street signs? Maybe in your native tongue they are, maybe they aren’t. Are churches buildings? According to reCAPTCHA not so much. Is this a lake or a river? How the heck am I supposed to know if you show me just one shoreline? Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

By Liam Tung | March 20, 2017 -- 13:11 GMT (06:11 PDT) | Topic: Mobility These pixel-zoomed areas from a picture of a cat's eye show the uncompressed original, left, with Guetzli, right, displaying fewer ringing artefacts than libjpeg, center, without needing a larger file size. Image: Google Google has developed a compression technology that can create high-quality JPEG images in files that are 35 percent smaller than those available from today's compression techniques. Google's latest effort to reduce web file sizes and speed up mobile downloads is called Guetzli, which uses search algorithms to encode JPEG images into a more compact format. Google's open-source Draco promises to squeeze richer 3D worlds into the web, gaming, and VR We will soon be swimming in a sea of geometric data, says Google, and this open source compression library could help. Read More Unlike Google's previous would-be PNG and JPEG replacement, WebP, and its RAISR photo-compression technique, the new 'perceptual' encoder doesn't veer from the JPEG standard and is compatible with existing browsers and image-processing applications. Guetzli targets a stage in JPEG compression processes called quantization where visual quality is traded off for a smaller file size. The new open-source encoder "strikes a balance between minimal loss and file size", according to Google, making these sacrifices less noticeable to users, while also trimming down increasingly large files on the web. Google hopes the new encoder will be used by image-heavy websites, allow website operators to offer a smoother browsing experience, and cut bandwidth costs for mobile users. It may also present a way of improving video compression. ZDNet sister site CNET explains that a second and equally important component of Guetzli's speed boost comes from a test called Butteraugli, which helps automate the testing of different compression settings and can simultaneously compare two different compression methods. "Butteraugli is a project that estimates the psychovisual similarity of two images. It gives a score for the images that is reliable in the domain of barely noticeable differences. Butteraugli not only gives a scalar score, but also computes a spatial map of the level of differences," Google notes in its GitHub page for Butteraugli. The one downside of Guetzli is that the use of search algorithms takes "significantly longer" to compress image file sizes than existing methods. On the other hand, research with human raters found they "consistently preferred" Guetzli-processed images over comparably sized and slightly larger libjpeg files. Therefore, Google judges its slower compression method as worth it.

Android O: Is this the Oreo feature list we'll see at Google I/O 2017? By Gerald Lynch Mobile phones   What's next for the big G's phones? Shares With Android Nougat comfortably settled into a bunch of different smartphones, with Google IO 2017 developer conference just two months away, all eyes in the mobile world now turn to what Google's got planned for Android's next revision. Android SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer has pointed to Android O's codename kicking off with a buttery biscuit Oreo base, but little else has even been hinted at yet. However, sources speaking to 9to5Google have let slip a few rumored features that we may now expect to see come the update's anticipated May unveiling. Potential Android O features It's a fairly long list of items, and none of this is confirmed or complete, but if we are going just on rumors, there's a distinct lack of a headline feature to match last year's Google Assistant launch. Potential new features include: Picture in picture mode: As is already seen on the iPad and some bespoke third-party launchers, as well as Google's own Android TV platform, this would let you have one app (or app function, such as a video player) remain open and on top of another separate app plane. App icon badges: On oldie that's been knocking around for years on iOS and some third-party launchers, this would bring at-a-glance waiting notification number bubbles to app icons on the homescreen, as a native Android feature. Restricted background activities: A power saving feature, this would de-prioritise app functions running in the background, going easier on your battery at the possible expense of having to reload some app functionality that would otherwise have been ticking over in the background. Notifications: A vague suggestion that new notification types could be brought to Android, or that their current way of being displayed would change. Smart selection: Perhaps the most interesting and potentially useful teased feature, this would integrate with Google Assistant to scan app text, pre-emptively highlighting important information (like phone numbers and addresses) for more easy copy-and-pasting between apps and text entry fields. Adaptive app icons: As the name suggests, this would let app icons change dynamically on homescreens. As a crude example, think of a calendar app icon that changed to show the appropriate date on a daily basis. All this comes in addition to new, undisclosed features that will make Android more relevant and attractive to enterprise users. For now, take the list of features with a pinch of salt until fully confirmed, though there's nothing here that sounds massively beyond the realms of possibility. 10 best Android phones: the best Google-powered phones money can buy in 2017 Topics Android Related news Google IO 2017: dates, rumors and news for Google's giant developer conference Microsoft’s new wireless Xbox One controller has Elite looks at half the price The best wireless earbuds available today The best free personal finance software 2017 See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Business & Tech This photo shows signage at the YouTube Space LA offices in Los Angeles | Image: Danny Moloshok / AP/Press Association Images 12:00 20 Mar 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 3 days ago Marks and Spencer has become the latest big name brand in Britain to pull its advertising from Google as the internet giant faces pressure across the Irish Sea over extremist content on its YouTube platform. The high street retailer said it was "pausing activity" adding to the list of commercial organisations that have already done so, as well as the British government. Global advertising giant Havas, which buys ad space for a number of big companies, got the ball rolling when it suspended advertising last week. The move came following the publication of a Times of London report which found that ads for hundreds of companies, universities and charities were appearing next to YouTube videos created by sympathisers to the likes of the Islamic State and the pro-Nazi Combat 18, and as a result funding extremism. M&S said: "In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through." McDonald's UK also said it had pulled ads through Google, saying it was "disappointed to learn" that safeguards it had "to protect against our adverts appearing alongside unacceptable content" had fallen through. Supermarket giant Tesco and high street banks Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Lloyds are among the brands taking a similar position, as is Audi UK and the Guardian newspaper. Guardian News & Media wrote in a statement: "It is completely unacceptable that Google allows advertising for brands like the Guardian to appear next to extremist and hate-filled videos." Other businesses including Barclays are considering what to do – though Barclays does not currently have any advertising on YouTube or Google. Sky said: "It is clearly unacceptable for ads to be appearing alongside inappropriate content and we are talking with Google to understand what they are doing to stop this." Elsewhere, media-buying agency GroupM, part of the world's largest ad agency WPP, told Google to apologise to customers and advertisers who saw inappropriate content on YouTube. It has also written to clients explaining the potential risks to their brands and asking them how they want to respond. British MPs recently said Google was "still profiting from hatred" after it failed to remove videos from groups allegedly linked to terrorism. Google was summoned to appear in front of Cabinet Office ministers on Friday. Sky News understands that the company apologised to senior civil servants representing the Government and pledged a review of their advertising systems. Google was asked to return for another meeting this week to set out the action they plan to take. Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, has said that Google's failure to remove the hate videos by was "frankly astonishing" Last week, the committee summoned bosses from Google, Facebook and Twitter, to question them about the action the web giants were taking to remove hate speech from their platforms. It also raised the issue of adverts automatically being put next to hate videos. A Google spokesman said last week: "We have strict guidelines that define where Google ads should appear, and in the vast majority of cases, our policies work as intended, protecting users and advertisers from harmful or inappropriate content. "We accept that we don't always get it right, and that sometimes, ads appear where they should not. We're committed to doing better, and will make changes to our policies and brand controls for advertisers."

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. Google is warning of a new email phishing scam that directs users to what looks like a Google sign-in page, in order to steal personal details and steal the user’s contacts’ details and passwords. The scam is extremely well designed. It starts with the scammer sending an email to your Gmail address that appears to come from one of your contacts. The email asks the reader to take a look at an attached file, usually a PDF or Word document. The email and the attachment may well seem to be legitimate as it comes from one of your contacts, but clicking on the document takes you to a new page in a new tab that prompts you to sign into your Gmail account again. Of course, you absolutely shouldn’t try to sign in again, as this is actually a fake page that mimics Google’s authentic sign in page. Entering your details here means the scammer gets access to them, and they not only steal your personal information but can try to scam your contacts too. The scam works because the attached document is in fact, not a document at all but an embedded image that appears to be a document. Click on it and it redirects to the fake sign in page, instead of attempting to download the file – which is what happens in normal cases. Luckily there are ways to spot the scam. The best way is to always check the browser address bar before trying to log in. The Google sign-in page that users are directed to appears legit, with the same logo, text boxes, and tagline. But the address bar is the tell-all: The page is a data URI with the prefix “data:text/html.” It’s not a URL that begins “https://.” Google also has recently released a Chrome update to 56.0.2924 to help spot such fake forms. With the update, if you view a data URL, the location bar will show “Not Secure” to help users spot phishing scams more easily. Users on laptop and desktop computers can often hover their cursor over the attachment to check its URL before clicking. About Mike Wheatley Mike Wheatley is the senior editor at Realty Biz News.

The launch was accompanied by a landing page that labeled this “an experimental new podium”. That same landing page remains live, unchanged, and with the same call to action at its conclusion to “Join the Waitlist”. Google Posts seemed to be a stripped-back version of Google+, devised with the intention of at least maintaining some of the functionality of a social network after sunsetting Google+. The main premise of Posts had ostensibly been to work as a one-way social platform, where brands or individuals could publish (and be indexed instantly), but without the requisite mechanisms to allow the audience to engage in conversation with the poster or ‘like’ the update. Since that tentative launch, Posts has perennially appeared in and disappeared from the SERPs in various guises, each time with very little fanfare. It initially appeared to be being trialed by a select few small businesses, then was spotted during Google I/O the following May, being used to publish live conference updates directly to the SERP. A few months after that, Google Posts reappeared in search results for a charter school in New York, KIPP NYC, and then disappeared again. Each time, users have remained in the dark about whether a fully-fledged roll-out of Google Posts might be on the horizon, and nothing much has happened in this space to justify the tag ‘experimental new podium’. However, that may be set to change. I noticed during a routine search for [red sox] that gifs were autoplaying within the knowledge graph sidebar, both on desktop (as in the screenshot below) and also on mobile.   This is particularly eye-catching and is in line with numerous other Google initiatives to bring a sense of vitality and immediacy to its results, most notably in the shape of Accelerated Mobile Pages and the decision to allow emoji in select organic results. Although the Posts initiative itself is not new and nor is its inclusion within search results, there is a clearly-labeled ‘New’ box in the top right of this section to alert users of a change. The same was observed for [yankees], so at least Google shows no clear bias in that sense:   This has been spotted by others in the last few weeks, although it does seem that is being rolled out in a piecemeal fashion. The two entities that appear to be taking part in this partnership with Google are Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League, as seen in the screenshot below in a search for the ice hockey team [new york rangers]: If it’s new, what has changed? GIFs were also spotted in SERPs on a few occasions when Google+ was up and running, but again this was isolated to a few brands, and it was clear that this was being pulled from their own Google+ account. What is most noteworthy in this instance is that these results may not be showing up as a result of direct action from each individual sports team. It is therefore worth assessing the source of the posts to ascertain whether brands will be expected to update their feed on an ongoing basis. This is quite vital if we want to know where this platform could go in future, as it helps us define whether this is a streamlined social media network (more in line with Twitter than Facebook) or more of an automated content syndication platform. Back to the Red Sox example for further investigation. First of all, clicking on an individual post, as it appears within the SERP, opens up a larger window containing the image or GIF. As you can see from the screenshot below, this is all contained within the same results page: Clicking on the ‘More’ link leads to the original post which, intriguingly, is hosted on MLB.com rather than the Red Sox Google Posts page. As such, this could be a welcome boon for brands like Major League Baseball, who will undoubtedly receive increased traffic. This will be of great interest to publishers, as there is the tantalising possibility of a new avenue to get their content in search results, should the initiative go mainstream. The Red Sox ‘profile page’ is really just a feed of images and external links to more in-depth content – all of which are hosted on MLB.com.   This arouses the suspicion that the functioning of Google Posts is changing, especially as this seems to be the case across all MLB teams. The same is also true of many ice hockey teams, which link out to NHL.com from all of their posts. As a result, it is plausible that the partnership here is between the sites hosting the content (MLB.com, NHL.com) and Google, with the individual sports teams acceptant beneficiaries of the increased engagement. In the initial announcement about Posts, the selling point was said to be that individuals or brands could publish directly to Google. That requires a certain complicity; one would have to take action to set this process in motion by posting content via Posts, whether fully-formed or just a link to an external site. In our coverage from March 2016, we noted that a few small businesses had been given access to Google Posts. There didn’t appear to be much in the way of consistent rationale for choosing these particular businesses over others, although their feeds are all still live. The fact that the links from the Red Sox are invariably from one website suggests that Google is automatically pulling these links through to its search results when they go live on MLB.com. This differs from the small business accounts, which are composed of unique updates written for Google Posts. This demonstrates an important and telling distinction from the original functioning of Posts, and could be one with far-reaching implications. What is Google seeking to accomplish through Posts? The reasons for doing this are self-evident. Eric Schmidt was very public in admitting that the company “missed the boat” on social media, their only real foray into the market being their overdue and (in hindsight) always-doomed Google+. That is a substantial missing piece in the jigsaw for a company that is competing with Facebook to maintain its digital advertising dominance. Speed is of the essence, as indicated by the growing presence of AMP pages in search results. Of course, it stands to reason that having brands publish directly on a Google platform is of great benefit to the search giant, as it has a significant task on its hands to crawl, index, cache, and serve everything that is published on the web instantaneously. Moreover, one reason for using Google+ as a content distribution platform in the past was simply that it led to faster indexing. If Posts can offer the same benefit, especially if updates about a brand are pulled automatically from relevant websites, there will be a clear use case for most companies.

The results pages are crowded as it is, so the addition of GIFs could only serve to intensify the battle for consumers’ attention spans. However, as always, we can expect Google to test this in detail before taking the plunge and releasing the functionality to the masses. One concern is that Google may give prominence to these results over other social networks, notably Twitter, in order to ensure its own success. Perhaps the reason for such a tentative entry into this space is the hope of avoiding another newsworthy social media misstep, should the initiative fail to take hold. The waitlist for Google Posts has been open for quite some time now, after all, but very few companies are active on the platform. Either demand is suspiciously low or (more likely) Google is taking its time on this one. That said, any opportunities to increase organic traffic are very welcome nowadays, and that could be what Posts comes to offer us. For now, we can only join the waitlist and patiently look forward to an invitation to start Posting.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Samsung officially unveils Bixby, its new AI assistant for mobile and IoT Paul Sawers@psawers March 20, 2017 6:47 AM Tags: Bixby, BotBeat Weekly, Samsung, top-stories Apple gave us Siri, Microsoft gave us Cortana, Amazon gave us Alexa, Google gave us, um, Google, and now Samsung has officially introduced its new AI-powered assistant to the world. After months of speculation that its new mobile assistant would be called Bixby, Samsung has now confirmed that Bixby is indeed the name of the assistant, which the company says is “fundamentally different” from the myriad voice-powered assistants already out there, according to a press release. Samsung says Bixby differs from the competition in that it will be able to support “almost” every task the app is capable of through through the touchscreen. This move does make sense, given that it can be confusing to figure out which commands are voice-enabled, though the fact that Samsung says Bixby will support “almost” every command suggests there may still be some confusion. At any rate, Samsung says Bixby-enabled apps will be more context aware so that they understand exactly what the user is trying to do and will also be able to understand and execute a user-actioned voice command even if the speaker doesn’t use the full command form with the words in the right order. In fact, Bixby may even “prompt users to provide more information” when required. Samsung calls this “cognitive tolerance.” We already knew that Samsung is preparing for a March 29 launch of its next flagship phone, which will unsurprisingly be called the Galaxy S8, and we reported back in January that Bixby would likely have a dedicated button on the side of the device. Samsung has now confirmed that to be the case, as is seeks to make enlisting the assistant’s help as frictionless as possible. “Confusion around activating a voice interface is a barrier we have removed to make it feel easier and more comfortable to give commands,” said InJong Rhee, executive vice president and head of R&D for Samsung’s software and services division. “For example, instead of taking multiple steps to make a call — turning on and unlocking the phone, looking for the phone application, clicking on the contact bar to search for the person that you’re trying to call, and pressing the phone icon to start dialing — you will be able to do all these steps with one push of the Bixby button and a simple command.” Samsung also says that at the S8 launch a handful of preinstalled apps will be Bixby-enabled, and over time the company will launch a software development kit (SDK) to allow any developer to build Bixby-enabled apps, similar to what its rivals do with their assistants. It’s no surprise that Samsung plans to open Bixby up to developers, as it’s the only real way to achieve scale. But Samsung wants to iterate the service in-house before it’s deemed ready for other developers. Given the increasing role that voice-activated assistants are playing in the broader internet of things (IoT) realm, it’s no surprise to learn that Bixby will also be landing on Samsung’s other products in the future, including TVs and air conditioners…maybe even fridges, who knows. “Since Bixby will be implemented in the cloud, as long as a device has an internet connection and simple circuitry to receive voice inputs, it will be able to connect with Bixby,” added Rhee. “As the Bixby ecosystem grows, we believe Bixby will evolve from a smartphone interface to an interface for your life.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

 An analyst downgraded Google after the YouTube advertiser boycott in the UK James Cook, Business Insider UK Mar. 20, 2017, 9:34 AM 1,417 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai.AP Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser downgraded Google stock on Monday after an advertiser boycott in the UK, which followed reports that ads from major brands were appearing next to terrorist videos on YouTube. Wieser downgraded Google's stock from "buy" to a "hold" after many of the UK's biggest brands boycotted Google's advertising network over brand safety fears. "Alphabet's Google is facing a serious issue in the UK with brand safety issues, which has global repercussions," Wieser wrote in the analyst note on Monday. "Although spending by advertisers who have announced their intention to suspend spending on YouTube and other Google properties is relatively small so far, we think that awareness of the incident will marginally curtail global growth this year vs. prior expectations, leading us to reduce our price target on Alphabet slightly, to $950 vs. $970 previously." Google's European boss Matt Brittin said on Monday that the issue of ads appearing next to hate speech on Google-owned sites affected "a handful of impressions and pennies not pounds of spend."

Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are all known for having smart, artificial intelligence-equipped digital assistants, and now you can add Samsung into that mix. Today, the company has officially announced its own spin on the virtual assistant, and it’s calling it Bixby. Samsung’s approach to an AI assistant (or “agent,” as the company likes to call them) is a bit different than what you or I might be used to from Siri or Cortana. Instead of being a database that you fire questions at or tell to do specific things, Bixby is meant to be a helper on your device, to make it easier to access to accomplish the litany of tasks that modern gadgets such as smartphones are capable of. A less charitable interpretation might be that Bixby exists to solve one of the most difficult challenges in all of tech: make Samsung’s own poorly designed software and interfaces easier to use. Bixby will first appear on the Galaxy S8, expected to be announced later this month. The phone will have a dedicated button to launch the assistant, but Samsung says that its initial capabilities will be limited to a handful of preinstalled apps, with others added over time. It will also be limited to just English and Korean at first, though there are plans to add other languages such as Chinese and US Spanish shortly after launch. Bixby will first appear on the S8 later this month How much you’ll get out of Bixby, should you buy an S8, will vary depending on your own needs, and it won’t be super powerful at first. Samsung isn’t providing specifics on how exactly it will work on the phone, but in a blog post announcing the service, it says, “When using a Bixby-enabled application, users will be able to call upon Bixby at any time and it will understand the current context and state of the application and will allow users to carry out the current work-in-progress continuously.” That’s a lot of words to say that Bixby will know what you’re looking at on your screen and provide options to take action on what’s there. It’s admittedly hard to wrap your head around how exactly Bixby is different from Google Assistant, Siri, Cortana, and others without using it. Dr. Injong Rhee, Samsung’s head of research and development for software and services, says it’s “philosophically different from other agents,” and its purpose is to “change user behavior from just using touch commands.” Bixby is not what you’ll use when you want to check the weather, convert 48 ounces to cups, or find out how old Jake Gyllenhaal is, but it can help you send the picture you’re looking at in your phone’s gallery app to your mom without having to switch apps or type her contact info in. Dr. Injong Rhee, Samsung’s head of research and development for software and services. Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge “Bixby is an intelligent user interface.” “Bixby is an intelligent user interface, emphasis on interface,” says Rhee. “A lot of other agents are focused on being knowledgeable, providing answers to fact-based questions, glorified extensions of search. Bixby is capable of developing a new interface to our devices, or devices that are going to host Bixby.” It’s designed to let you seamlessly switch between voice commands and touch interfaces, and help you along various steps of your task. Samsung says this is different from other assistants, which try to complete every task from start to finish and fail completely if they are unable to. “Bixby will be smart enough to understand commands with incomplete information and execute the commanded task to the best of its knowledge, and then will prompt users to provide more information and take the execution of the task in piecemeal,” explains the company in its blog post. Bixby may not be able to do everything at first, but it will get you as far along as it can in the task before you have to intervene. Samsung knows it can’t compete with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others when it comes to raw machine learning power and putting vast amounts of information at your fingertips, so it’s using Bixby to solve a simpler task that those companies have largely ignored. It’s not hugely different from Google’s efforts with Now on Tap, but Samsung argues that its deeper integration of Bixby within apps will make it more useful and more reliable than prior efforts. The overarching goal, according to Rhee, is “to make the interface of the phone simpler and more natural to use.” He claims that out of the box, our smartphones can perform over 10,000 tasks, while current digital assistants — he contends — can only do about 100. Samsung’s goal is to have Bixby be able to perform every task that you can do with touch via voice. “Everything you can do with a touch command, you can do with a voice command when using a Bixby-enabled application,” boasts Rhee. The ambitions for Bixby don’t end with the phone Samsung’s ambitions for Bixby don’t end with the phone, however, and the company envisions the assistant being useful in a whole range of its products, from appliances to TV remotes to wearables. Rhee says that Bixby can work with anything that “has an internet connection and a microphone.” He posits that the assistant could help you make use of all of the complex features and options on modern appliances, such as your washing machine or microwave, many of which often go unused. Since it’s a cloud-based service, its capabilities can carry across devices: you could ask your washing machine to make a call, and it will route the call through the cell phone in your pocket, for example. Dr. Rhee says the thing that will unite all of these various Bixby-enabled devices is a dedicated hardware button to launch the service. “Having a button solves a lot of problems for us,” says Rhee, noting that it can take care of both launching the assistant and biometrically authenticating the user at the same time, should Samsung decide to combine a fingerprint scanner with it. There are bigger implications for the Bixby button, too; it can be seen as the bridge between Samsung, the established hardware maker and the ambitions of Samsung, the software and services company. (Bixby Bridge is a literal bridge located about 120 miles south of San Francisco, so the metaphor is perhaps a bit heavy handed.) Rhee notes that a dedicated button moves the assistant away from the “already overloaded” home button, how Siri and Google Assistant are launched, and should increase the adoption rate of it for S8 owners. But it’s a big gamble: if Bixby isn’t able to deliver a great experience every single time, it makes an entire button on your phone’s precious real estate virtually useless. These are all lofty ambitions and Rhee admits it’s going to take a long time for Bixby to accomplish them all. Samsung is planning to release an SDK for third-party developers to plug into to expand the assistant’s capabilities, but history has shown that just because an SDK exists, there’s no guarantee developers will come running. Samsung’s dreams hang on the first impression that Bixby makes Though Bixby is a product of Samsung’s own internal development, the company’s recent acquisition, Viv, will be put to work making Bixby play nice with other third-party services. Viv has a pedigree here: the company was founded by the creators of Apple’s Siri assistant, which had many third-party integrations before it was folded into iOS itself. If there’s a bull case to be made that Bixby will be successful, Viv will be central to it. Of course, first impressions are everything when it comes to virtual assistants (just ask all the people that tried Siri when it first came out, found it disappointing, and never looked at it again), and Bixby is going to have to deliver if it is going to be as revolutionary as Samsung hopes. Samsung’s first attempt at a voice assistant, the clumsy and slow S Voice, doesn’t inspire a ton of confidence either. We’ll find out just how good Bixby’s first impressions are in a matter of weeks when the Galaxy S8 debuts.

Google’s offer of a quid pro quo makes a lot of sense given Thailand’s status as a growing mobile-first market. According to eMarketer estimates, there will be 30.0 million smartphone users in the country by the end of this year, representing 43.8% of the population. eMarketer expects that penetration rate to cross the 50% threshold by 2020, when 35.1 million people in Thailand will use smartphones. Understandably then, digital advertising—Google’s core revenue stream—is shifting toward mobile in the country. eMarketer projects mobile ad spending will account for just 7.3% of all media ad spending in Thailand this year, and 41.8% of total digital ad spending. However, outlays for mobile ads will more than double from $168.5 million in 2017 to $343.0 million by 2020, when it will make up 14.3% of total media ad expenditures. Fully aware of this, Google now seeks to appeal to SMBs—which, according to the Bangkok Post, account for 40% of Thailand’s GDP—that may lack the technical knowledge or resources to create an online presence. Google reports that just 10% of SMBs in Thailand have company websites and that many of them were designed specifically for desktops, not for mobile devices. “Having a mobile website will be an essential marketing tool for [SMBs] to increase their presence in the large online community,” Ghislain Chatelier, Google’s regional director for Southeast Asia and Greater China, told the Bangkok Post. Google is also offering its SMB partners the use of a tool to help determine if its website’s pages are loading quickly and efficiently. The company has been pushing for widespread adoption of its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) open source mobile website standard by prioritizing AMP pages in its search results. Part of Google’s motivation in getting into Thailand is likely to stave off competition from Facebook, the other half of the global digital advertising duopoly. According to data from the Digital Advertising Association (Thailand), advertisers spent more than THB2.84 billion ($83 million) on Facebook ads in the country last year, vs. roughly THB1.66 billion ($48.6 million) on YouTube ads. —Rahul Chadha New Report in eMarketer PRO This Week US Ad Spending: The eMarketer Forecast for 2017 US paid media ad spending will grow steadily in 2017, on the heels of a strong 2016 boosted by the Rio Olympics and the presidential election.

Vietnam Calls for Halt on Social Media Advertising Officials in Vietnam have asked businesses in the country to stop advertising on Facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms until they stop hosting content deemed critical of the government. The country’s communist government also requested that users “raise their voice to Google and Facebook to prevent toxic, fake content violating Vietnamese law in the online environment.” Google Program to Help Startups in German-Speaking Countries Google has launched Google Marketing Solutions for Startups in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, according to Ecommerce News Europe.

US CEOs Get Social New data from communications firm Weber Shandwick shows that today’s CEOs know the importance of social media. Over 90% of US public company CEOs, 76% of private company CEOs and 86% of Silicon Valley CEOs are present or visible though social channels. However, CEOs are not posting as often as they could—roughly 40% of CEOs at these types of companies posted in the past 12 months. India’s Fashion Retailer Myntra Opens Physical Store Myntra, the India-based fashion-focused online retailer owned by Flipkart, opened its first physical store this week in Bangalore, the country’s tech hub. The store, named Roadster, features products from Myntra’s private-label line of the same name. Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan told the Economic Times that the move was the “first step towards bringing an omnichannel presence.” China Bike-Sharing Service Ofo Turns to Social Credit System TechNode reported that Ofo, one of China’s largest bike-sharing services, now uses Sesame Credit, a social credit system developed by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, to determine whether its customers need to provide a deposit to rent its bicycles. Under the new system, users with a Sesame Credit score above a certain threshold would no longer need to put down a deposit. Sesame Credit relies on data from various Alibaba services to determine consumer credit scores, which are relatively new to China.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google Search Lead: I Can't Go After Individual Problems In Search Results Google Search Lead: I Can't Go After Individual Problems In Search Results Mar 20, 2017 • 7:41 am | (5) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story We all know how bad some feature snippets in Google's search results can look but even if you point it out to one of Google's lead search engineers, it might not get fixed. Let's look at a recent example where Paul Haahr from Google responded on Twitter to a complaint about a really bad featured snippet. The search result was for [can a sitting president be arrested] and it features a photoshop image of President Obama standing in front of cops with his hands behind him as if he is being arrested in court. Here is what the search result looks like on mobile: Paul Haahr from Google first apologized to the searcher saying "Sorry." He then admitted it is a bad result, "yes, very bad." Sadly, he goes on to explain that he personally can't go around fixing individual issues in search, "but I can't go after individual problems," he added. "There is a feedback link on that screen for this reason," which goes into some sort of bucket. Google does take care of those feedback results quickly for featured snippets, I believe. Paul Haahr, from what I know, isn't a fan of Trump, I believe he was a pretty big Obama supporter. Why is this important? It shows you that even the most senior Googlers, who worked directly on search, can't go in and just clean up a poor search result. It shows you the algorithm controls it and they need the feedback to improve the overall algorithm. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google's Top Stories Inclusion Is Algorithmic, No Manual Inclusion Google's Top Stories Inclusion Is Algorithmic, No Manual Inclusion Mar 20, 2017 • 7:55 am | (2) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Some think that being included in Google News, which is a human, manual inclusion process, is the same as being included in the "top stories" section in web search. It is not. Back in 2014, Google dropped the requirement for showing up in that box as being part of Google News and any site or blog can technically show in the top stories box. John Mueller responded on Twitter to a webmaster who is upset his site no longer shows up in the top stories section saying it is algorithmic and there is nothing specific you can do. @mxdwn @mistry213 This is fully algorithmic, there's no manual way to force it in.— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) March 20, 2017 You can't force Google to show you there, no way to do it. :) Truth is, ever since Google tweaked the top stories algorithm (Google did not confirm this) back in late November, it was less likely for none Google News sites to be included there. We do know Google is working on only showing stuff here and other search results that are more accurate. In any event, Google says that you can't press a button and just reverse everything to get your site back into the Top Stories section. I suspect you need to work on making your site more of an authority. Of course, it also depends on the query. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google AdWords > Google AdWords Upsets Advertisers By Expanding Meaning Of Close Variants Google AdWords Upsets Advertisers By Expanding Meaning Of Close Variants Mar 20, 2017 • 8:27 am | (34) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google AdWords Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Late Friday afternoon, Google announced they are changing the behavior of how close variants works in Google AdWords. Google said "over the coming months we’re expanding close variant matching to include additional rewording and reordering for exact match keywords." Advertisers, as a whole, are not happy about this change - which is why Google timed the announcement for a late Friday afternoon. Google said "early tests show advertisers may see up to 3% more exact match clicks on average while maintaining comparable clickthrough and conversion rates," of course. But advertisers want more control, not less. Function Words Ignoring Function words are prepositions (in, to), conjunctions (for, but), articles (a, the) and other words, Google says "don't impact the intent behind a query." So now exact match will ignore these function words to match with similar queries. Here is the chart that explains what is going away: Word Order Ignored Google says that "two keywords can share the same meaning, even if the word order is slightly different." But is that the case always? Now, exact match will use that same logic to match with queries that are reordered variations of your keyword. Christoph Hoffinger said on Twitter, "@adwords what about renaming the keyword options to "almost exact match", "somewhat phrase match" & "anything can happen broad match." @adwords what about renaming the keyword options to "almost exact match", "somewhat phrase match" & "anything can happen broad match" 😉— Christoph Hoffinger (@choffinger) March 19, 2017 Mateusz Kitka said on Google+, "the worst change in adwords campaign management ever." Ginny Marvin goes into these changes in detail at Search Engine Land. So if this impacts you, which is probably does, well worth a read. Forum discussion at Google+.

 UBER IN CRISIS: How a string of high-profile problems led to Uber’s worst possible start to 2017 Sam Shead Mar. 20, 2017, 9:37 AM 13,785 facebook linkedin twitter email print Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Lovekin/Getty Images for OurTime.org Morale at Uber's head office in San Francisco could well be at its lowest level this week after two more executives announced they intend to leave the taxi-hailing giant over the weekend. Uber president Jeff Jones and Uber vice president of maps and business platform Brian McClendon became the latest high-profile executives to abandon Travis Kalanick's company, which has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons since the start of 2017. January: Thousands of users deleted the app More than 200,000 Uber customers deleted Uber's app over the course of the last weekend in January as part of the #DeleteUber movement. The movement came about after drivers tried to do business at JFK airport during a taxi strike organised by The New York Taxi Workers Alliance. Drivers were protesting against President Donald Trump's executive order, which prevented travellers from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. Kalanick initially seemed reluctant to criticise the executive order. In an email to Uber staff that he shared on Facebook on January 28, Kalanick wrote: "This ban will impact many innocent people – an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump’s first business advisory group meeting." Following the strikes, Kalanick came under intense criticism over his close ties to Trump and he was forced to leave Trump’s economic advisory council. February 21: Scathing blog post alleges sexism and gender bias inside Uber On February 21, the company announced it has launched an internal investigation into its workplace culture after ex-engineer Susan Fowler wrote a blog post about her experience of gender bias and sexual harassment at Uber. In her post, the Stanford computer science graduate claimed that: Her manager propositioned her and other female Uber workers for sex — "On my first official day rotating on the team, my new manager sent me a string of messages over company chat. He was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn't." HR said the manager in question would not be punished because it was his first offence and he was a high performer — "When I reported the situation, I was told by both HR and upper management that even though this was clearly sexual harassment and he was propositioning me, it was this man's first offense, and that they wouldn't feel comfortable giving him anything other than a warning and a stern talking-to." HR ignored some of her other complaints and lied to her about it being his first offence — "It became obvious that both HR and management had been lying about this being 'his first offense,' and it certainly wasn't his last." Uber bought leather jackets for over 120 men but not six women — "The director replied back [to Fowler's email asking where the jackets were], saying that if we women really wanted equality, then we should realize we were getting equality by not getting the leather jackets ... We were told that if we wanted leather jackets, we women needed to find jackets that were the same price as the bulk-order price of the men's jackets." Her manager threatened to fire her for reporting things to HR — "I told him that was illegal, and he replied that he had been a manager for a long time, he knew what was illegal, and threatening to fire me for reporting things to HR was not illegal." Following the blog post, Kalanick said: "I have just read Susan Fowler's blog. What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in. It's the first time this has come to my attention so I have instructed Liane Hornsey our new Chief Human Resources Officer to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations. We seek to make Uber a just workplace and there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber — and anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is OK will be fired." February 22: New York Times article "Inside Uber's Aggressive, Unrestrained Workplace Culture" published On February 22, the New York Times published a bombshell report titled "Inside Uber’s Aggressive, Unrestrained Workplace Culture" that suggested Fowler's claims were not isolated. Employees did cocaine during a company retreat and a manager had to be fired after groping multiple women, according to the report. Former employees said they'd notified Uber's leadership, including Kalanick and CTO Thuan Pham, of the workplace harassment. Following Fowler's blog post, former Google designer and Uber developer Chris Messina tweeted that his experience at Uber was "similarly callous & unsupportive". This is outrageous and awful. My experience with Uber HR was similarly callous & unsupportive; in Susan's case, it was reprehensible. 😡👎🏻 https://t.co/eSiOuHSMjU — Chris Messina 🦅 (@chrismessina) 19 February 2017 Kalanick subsequently recruited ex-US attorney general Eric Holder, who served under President Barack Obama, to conduct a review of the sexual harassment claims. Holder and Tammy Albarran, who are partners at the law firm Covington & Burling, were hired to look into complaints about one particular manager at Uber. February 23: Uber finds itself in a bitter legal fight with investor Google On February 23, Uber was sued by Google, one of its investors, for allegedly using stolen technology. The lawsuit — detailed in this Bloomberg Businessweek cover story — has been filed by Waymo, Google's self-driving car group. The suit claims that a team of ex-Google engineers stole the company's design for the lidar laser sensor that allows self-driving cars to map the environment around them. Waymo's lawsuit says that Anthony Levandowski, Uber's self-driving car boss and an ex-Waymo employee, downloaded 9.7 gigabytes of files containing information about the Waymo's self-driving technology to his laptop and then transferred those files to another external storage device. Levandowski claims that he downloaded those files to his computer so that he could work from home. February 28" Dashcam video shows Kalanick in a heated argument with an Uber driver On February 28, a video published by Bloomberg showed Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver over falling fares. "You know what? Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own s---," Kalanick said to the driver. "They blame everything in their life on somebody else." March 3: Report reveals details of Uber's controversial 'Greyball' tool On March 3, details of a tool Uber allegedly used to fool government authorities were published. The tool, known as Greyball, reportedly collected data from Uber's app to identify and evade officials in cities like Boston, Paris, and Las Vegas. The New York Times reported that the tool was deployed in markets where Uber was outright banned or being resisted by law enforcement. Uber did not deny the existence of the tool in a statement it provided to Business Insider. The company said the tool was an important measure to protect drivers by flagging dangerous individuals who might try to harm its drivers. "This program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service — whether that's people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret ‘stings’ meant to entrap drivers," the company said. March 17: Leaked data shows Uber's self-driving cars still rely heavily on humans To make matters worse, data leaked last week showed that Uber's self-driving car project is a long way from becoming a reality. One particularly alarming statistic was that in the week that ended March 8, the cars travelled only 0.8 miles on average between each time a human driver had to take control, overriding the self-driving tech, otherwise known as a disengagement. By comparison, Google's self-driving cars are streets ahead. Waymo cars last year were being disengaged at a rate of just once per 5,000 miles, according to data released in February. Uber's self-driving car. Uber Executives to have left the company in the last few weeks include: Jeff Jones, Uber's president Brian Mclendon, Uber's VP of maps and business platform Gary Marcus, head of Uber AI Labs Raffi Krikorian, senior director of engineering at Uber's Advanced Technologies Centre Charlie Miller, a key member of Uber's self-driving car team Amit Singhal, SVP of engineering Ed Baker, Uber's VP of product and growth Rumours suggest Travis Kalanick could soon step down as CEO Two "well-placed" sources reportedly told the BBC that Kalanick could step down after Uber appoints a new chief operating officer (COO). However, another source told the BBC that there was "zero chance" of this happening. Wired published an opinion piece on March 9 titled "Travis Kalanick doesn't need a new COO. He needs a new CEO" while an anonymous Uber shareholder told The Financial Times that it's time for Kalanick to "step back." "It is time for him to step back and continue to be innovator-in-chief and problem-solver-in-chief," said the anonymous investor, adding that it's also time to "let a grown-up be CEO."

Matt Brittin, the head of Google’s Europe, Middle East and Africa division, said today the group has reached out to companies affected by the placement of advertising next to videos that advocate terrorism.   “I want to start by saying sorry,” Brittan said at the Advertising Week Europe event in London. “When anything like this happens we take responsibility for it.” His remarks come a day after Marks and Spencer Group Plc (M&S) (LON:MKS) said it plans to halt advertising on Google and YouTube after its marketing was placed alongside extremist content. In a statement last night, an M&S spokesperson said:  “In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through,” M&S said. M&S joins a string of companies that have suspended adverts, including the BBC, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, L’Oreal, Audi and international media agency Havas. Sky plc, Barclays plc, Vodafone and Waitrose are also reportedly considering doing the same. YouTube, one of Google’s subsidiaries, pays £6.15 of advertising revenue to those who post videos, which means companies have been inadvertently funding terror groups. The UK government has paused spending on YouTube until the problem is resolved. The funding is part of a £60mln annual budget for digital advertising, Brittin said the issue of ads appearing alongside radical videos on YouTube was affecting “pennies, not pounds” of Google’s spend but that it was an “important issue” that needs to be addressed. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), currently relies on users to flag up such videos. The group has promised to make changes to its technology in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear. Google is reviewing its ad policies and will make changes to how it controls and enforces appropriate advertising on its platforms. “We have a review under way on how we can improve. We are accelerating that review,” Brittan said. Further details on Google’s plans to fix the problem are expected to be unveiled later this week. -- Adds apology from Google EMEA chief --- Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Renae Dyer Register here to be notified of future MKS Company articles View full MKS profile Marks and Spencer Group Plc Timeline Article January 18 2017 Marks & Spencer - 'It works' says one broker as it repeats its 'buy' on the retailer Video January 13 2017 Watch out if M&S shares dip below this point, warns chartist Article January 12 2017 Marks & Spencer: City split on the outlook for the retailer even after better-than-expected festive Article January 12 2017 M&S up as it posts first quarterly rise in clothing sales in nearly two years as Christmas trading s Article December 13 2016 Marks and Spencer looking for new chairman, with Robert Swanell to retire in 2017 Newswire November 29 2016 Sell Marks & Spencer says gloomy Investec Article November 14 2016 Is the worst over for Marks after its place on Britain's High Street firmly rattled Video November 09 2016 Marks & Spencer heading down to 250p says Zak Mir Article November 08 2016 Is M&S boss Steve Rowe's honeymoon period over already?

By James Billington Updated March 20, 2017 18:00 GMT Close Head of Google Europe apologises for online adverts appearing near extremist material ITN Following complaints from major brands and retailers that their ads were being placed alongside extremist YouTube videos, Google has publicly apologised and vowed to rectify the issue. Marks and Spencer was the latest of several high-profile companies to have pulled their ads from the video platform following the likes of HSBC, Sky and Vodafone. Matt Brittin, the head of Google's EMEA Business and Operations, addressed the issue with a statement that read: "We are sorry to hear of anybody that's been affected, we are working hard to improve policy, controls and enforcement, there will be more specifics very soon, and we are working on that with the industry." The company's first steps will be to review where and how ads are placed and a stronger enforcement of keeping inappropriate content off the site. The details of how Google plans to stamp out the issue and what new ad policy changes will take effect are expected to be revealed later in the week as Brittin attends the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London. It is reported that YouTube accounts posting extremist content, including that of former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke, could have made around £250,000 from the ads placed alongside their videos. Matt Brittin, Google President of EMEA Business and Operations, apologises for major brand ads appearing on extremist YouTube videosReuters Google explains that its inability to catch inappropriate content is down to the fact that it only reviews videos flagged by other users and due to the sheer amount of video material posted to YouTube each day (400 hours every minute), it can take longer than hoped to address complaints. Google UK managing director Ronan Harris said last week, "We've heard from our advertisers and agencies loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content." It is expected that the controls brands have over their ads and where they will appear are to be modified said Brittin, however we will have to wait to see what exactly the new policies and privileges will be. The fallout from this controversy has made a significant impact on YouTube's ads business and digital market as a whole. The FT reports that Google controls 60% of the digital ads market and the UK government has joined major brands in freezing its YouTube spending, which is reported to be around £60m per year.

It came after Marks and Spencer became the latest firm to pull its online ads over the issue, joining others such as Audi, RBS and L'Oreal. Google's European chief, Matthew Brittin, promised to review the firm's policies and strengthen enforcement. But some questioned the company's commitment to tackling the issue. A recent investigation by the Times found adverts from a range of well-known firms and organisations had appeared alongside content from supporters of extremist groups on YouTube's video site. An advert appearing alongside a video earns the poster about £6 for every 1,000 clicks it generates, meaning brands may have unwittingly contributed money to extremists. The Times said that rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers were among those receiving payouts. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent There are two difficult issues for Google here - spotting videos that are illegal and should be removed from YouTube, and determining which are legal but not suitable for advertising. Pressed by reporters on whether the firm would employ people to actively hunt down extremist videos, Matt Brittin was evasive, indicating that a combination of smart technology and user alerts to harmful content was a better option. But his main challenge will be in providing more clarity to customers when it comes to deciding which videos are "ad-safe". Drawing the line won't be easy - as he pointed out, news organisations put a lot of disturbing content online but need to earn money from advertising if they are to continue to invest in journalism. Mr Brittin seems confident that by having a thorough look at its policies and showing advertisers how they can control where their messages appear, Google can regain their confidence. But the company, which insists it's a technology platform not a media business, is finding it ever harder to hold that line. Media firms face tight regulation - and that is what may be coming Google's way if it doesn't clean up its act.

And on Monday M&S joined a growing list of firms to suspend their advertising from both Google's search engine and YouTube site. Others include McDonald's, HSBC, Lloyds, the BBC, Channel 4 and the Guardian. 'Not far enough' Speaking at the Advertising Week Europe conference, Mr Brittin said: "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content." He also promised that Google would exert more control over where ads were placed and improve its record for reviewing questionable content. Further details are expected later this week. However, Labour MP Yvette Cooper told the Guardian the apology had not gone far enough. "They need to say whether they will be paying back any of that advertising revenue and to answer our questions on what more they are doing to root out extremism or illegal activity on YouTube because they are still failing to do enough to remove illegal or hate-filled content from YouTube." Brian Wieser, an analyst at the brokerage Pivotal, meanwhile downgraded Google's stock on Monday, saying the scandal would curtail its profits this year. "Alphabet's Google is facing a serious issue in the UK with brand safety issues, which has global repercussions," he wrote in an analyst note. Media captionGoogle must "place these ads in the right way" Sir Martin Sorrell told Radio 4's The World at One Mark Mulligan, a media and technology consultant at Midia, told the BBC that the complaints against Google "were not new" and showed the internet was "still in its adolescence". "When the internet was founded, it was all about doing away with the gatekeeper. But now we're facing fake news and inappropriate content and that clashes with business models like Google's which are built on selling advertising." He said Google was likely to weather the storm, but that such incidents would weaken its dominance of the online advertising market. "Every incident like this gives Facebook an opportunity to steal a march on Google," he said.

Business Google boss apologises over extremist content as clients pull ads Clare Hutchison, Simon English Monday 20 March 2017 15:46 GMT Click to follow The Evening Standard There is a growing row over brands’ adverts appearing alongside extreme material on YouTube Getty Images The European boss of Google has apologised to clients and promised to improve its advertising policies after adverts for major brands were shown alongside extreme content. Major organisations including McDonald's, L'Oreal and the Government have pulled their marketing from YouTube after it emerged that ads had run against videos containing extreme material, such as clips by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The ads, placed via programmatic systems, can earn revenue for those who post videos. Matt Brittin, who runs Google in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: "I would like to apologise to our partners who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content. We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously. "We've made a public commitment to doing better and making improvements in three areas: raising the bar for our ads policies; simplifying advertiser controls and adding safer defaults; and increasing investment in enforcement to act faster." However, Brittin did not answer questions at an industry conference about whether employees would actively seek out inappropriate content. The apology comes after action from a number of brands. Department store John Lewis became the latest to suspend advertising via Google, saying it was awaiting "reassurances on the actions they are taking". Earlier Sky called the situation "clearly unacceptable". "We are talking with Google to understand what they are doing to stop this happening," it added.

Matt Brittin, Google’s head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told the Advertising Week Europe conference in London on Monday: “I want to start by saying sorry to the brands affected by this. I take the issue very seriously and I apologise in the instances where that may have happened.” But his response was deemed inadequate by Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and home affairs select committee chair, who said the company was “failing to do enough” to weed out extremist content. Brittin told an audience of advertising industry figures that the company would improve its ad placement system, which has seen ads attached to videos by extremists, including hate preachers and the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The ads help fund payments to the people who post the videos, with every 1,000 clicks worth about £6. Brittin insisted the sums involved had been “pennies not pounds” but admitted “clearly we need to do more on that”. Google braces for questions as more big-name firms pull adverts Read more He declined three times to say whether Google would start actively seeking out extremist content, rather than investigating only after users flag up inappropriate material, such as videos on YouTube, which it owns. “Of course we’re looking again at how we improve what we’re doing on enforcement. That’s a question of resources and technology and community,” he said. Cooper, who last week accused the company of “profiting from hatred” said she was not satisfied with Brittin’s response to the issue. “This apology from Google doesn’t go far enough,” she said. “They need to say whether they will be paying back any of that advertising revenue and to answer our questions on what more they are doing to root out extremism or illegal activity on YouTube because they are still failing to do enough to remove illegal or hate-filled content from YouTube. “They still don’t seem to have woken up to the seriousness and toxicity of some of the videos they are still hosting and their own responsibility to deal with that. And they still haven’t agreed to use any of their much-feted search engines to identify illegal content such as National Action videos and remove them. “It isn’t enough for Google to respond only when their advertising revenues take a hit. They are one of the biggest and most powerful companies on the planet. They can afford to do far more, far faster to deal with illegal and hate-filled content online.” Brittin admitted that the company “need[s] to do better” but also appeared to blame advertisers for failing to deploy tools designed to ensure their ads do not appear next to extremist content. “What we found is that there are many controls available but they’re not always being used so we need to make sure they’re simpler and easier to use,” said Brittin. Google executives have been summoned to the Cabinet Office later this week to explain to ministers what they plan to do about extremist content and ads attached to it on YouTube and Google’s wider network. But a date for the meeting has yet to be arranged, according to Whitehall sources, while Brittin was unable to say what measures the company will promise to take. “You’ll have more detail from us very soon on that. We’re working to get it right and if we need some improvement we will do,” he said. The government and several high-profile companies have suspended adverts, or are reviewing whether to do so, after it emerged that extremists including Duke were able to profit from adverts on Google’s network. Marks & Spencer became the latest company to pull advertising from Google on Monday, adding its name to a growing list that includes government departments, major advertising agencies and well-known companies. McDonald’s, the BBC, L’Oréal, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, the Guardian, Audi and Channel 4 are among the firms to suspend advertising. BT and Sky said they were reviewing their relationship with Google. Unilever’s chief marketing officer, Keith Weed, who was speaking alongside Brittin at the Advertising Week Europe seminar, said the consumer goods company has not pulled its adverts from Google and had not yet been affected. Brittin’s public apology comes after he was urged to do so by Rob Norman, chief digital officer at GroupM, part of the world’s largest advertising group WPP. While Brittin admitted that Google had work to do to mend fences with advertisers, he also pointed out that it handles a huge volume of content, including 400 hours of YouTube video uploaded every minute.

 IPG CEO on YouTube advertiser boycott: 'The best way to fix it is to hold them economically accountable' Julien Rath Mar. 20, 2017, 8:00 AM 860 facebook linkedin twitter email print IPG CEO and Chairman Michael Roth.Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images LONDON — Michael Roth, CEO of Interpublic Group (IPG), said the advertising agency holding wasn't ruling out freezing its spend with Google if it didn't fix the issue of ads appearing next to extremist content. Speaking on a panel discussion at Advertising Week Europe in London on Monday, Roth said: "We did have one or two clients that had [ads appearing in inappropriate slots on Google platforms] and we discussed it with Google. We believe that we and our clients are entitled to have our works for our clients displayed in a manner that's consistent with the values of our clients." "Google assured us they would fix this very quickly and so we've chosen to hold them accountable rather than pull our allocations," he said. "To the extent it doesn't change we'll hold them accountable by the best way we know how and we'll hold back funds." He explained IPG has its own monitoring tools to identify where online ads are placed and said the debate in the UK over the past few weeks highlighted the increasing need for the industry to take more responsibility over areas such as transparency and ad viewability. Roth pointed out the spend freeze, from the UK government and advertisers like the McDonald's, Audi, and The Guardian, was on Google display ads, which appear on YouTube and across Google's ad network not search advertising, where IPG puts most of its spend with Google. Earlier this week, Havas Group UK chief executive and country manager Paul Frampton announced last week the agency was stopping its UK clients' spend on Google until the internet company sorts the issue. Global chairman and CEO of the group Yannick Bollore reacted to the announcement with a tweet saying he was unaware the group was halting its spend, worldwide. I was completely unaware of the decision of Havas UK with Google. I will investigate what happened before making an official statement — Yannick Bolloré (@YannickBollore) March 17, 2017 Google Europe boss Matt Brittin also appeared at Advertising Week Europe on Monday. Ahead of his discussion on stage with Unilever marketing chief Keith Weed, Brittin told a small press briefing that ads appearing next to extremist content on YouTube was affecting "pennies, not pounds" of advertising spend. However, Brittin also apologized and said the company will be making an announcement in "the coming days" about how it is improving its systems to prevent this from happening again.

The image library says providers like Google "do nothing" to detect or prevent copyright infringement and that safe harbors actually encourage them to turn a blind eye. The notion that online platforms should not be held responsible for the infringing acts of their users is something entrenched in law in many regions, including the United States and Europe. In Australia, however, a perceived drafting error in the implementation of the Australia – US Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) means that safe harbor provisions only apply to commercial Internet service providers. As a result, Google, Facebook, YouTube and similar platforms face copyright uncertainty, a tenuous position also suffered by schools, universities, museums, libraries and archives. If proposed amendments to the Copyright Act are adopted, all of the above will receive enhanced safe harbor protections and the country into be brought into compliance with AUSFTA. Instead, however, battle lines are being drawn, with technology companies on one side and heavily copyright-reliant entities on the other. Today it’s the turn of Getty Images to throw its hat into the ring. Getty has been embroiled in dozens of copyright lawsuits in its history so is well aware of the difficulties its business can encounter. It’s also strongly against safe harbors that would allow companies like Google to use its images in search results, for example, without having to shoulder any liability. Speaking with The Australian (paywall), Getty Images’ general counsel Yoko Miyashita says that safe harbors have been ruthlessly exploited by online platforms and actually make it harder for copyright holders to protect their rights. “Here in the US the safe harbors were intended to provide strong incentives for online ­service providers and copyright holders to co-operate to detect and deal with copyright infringements … but that has never materialized,” Miyashita says. “There is no incentive for co-operation. The safe harbors are instead used by service providers as a shield and an excuse for doing nothing to detect or prevent copyright infringement.” When service providers become aware that their platforms are being used for infringement in a specific case, it’s argued that they are required to take remedial action to bring them into compliance and maintain their safe harbor protections. But for the Getty general counsel, all this does is force technology platforms to look even further in the opposite direction to avoid knowledge, rather than getting sucked into a copyright minefield. Becoming involved in steps to prevent piracy can even mean they become further exposed. “In fact, we have seen that ­service providers risk greater ­liability if they take steps to detect and prevent infringements, so they are encouraged to stick their head in the sand,” Miyashita said. While the music, movie and TV show companies have their specific complaints against Google, Getty Images feels it is particularly exposed by the search giant’s actions. While movies and TV shows are largely streamed or downloaded from third-party sites to which Google merely links, Getty’s images appear in results themselves, ready to be shared with others with a couple of clicks. Results can be taken down of course, but the onus lies with copyright holders to take action in each and every case, something which sees Google process millions of takedown notices every week. “Each of those reports represents an instance where copyright holders were not com­pensated for use of their works,” Miyashita notes. “This shows not only the burden on copyright holders to identify infringements and prepare and send notices…but also the lack of respect for copyright which has been fuelled in large part by the safe harbors.” That Getty Images should single out Google in the safe harbor debate comes as no surprise, as the companies rarely see eye to eye when it comes to the use of Getty’s images. Last year the stock photograph outfit filed a complaint with the European Union’s antitrust commission, claiming that Google is engaged in piracy of its content. Getty told the EU that Google undermines its business by utilizing Getty stock images in a manner that “siphons traffic” away from the Getty’s own website. Considering that safe harbor provisions are standard across Europe and the United States, the battle underway in Australia is something of an anomaly. That being said, the fact that Australia-based technology companies are now being forced to fight entertainment and heavily copyright-dependent industries to achieve their goals is nothing new and is only likely to drive the parties apart – or investment away. At the moment the momentum is in favor of safe harbor introduction, but things are only just getting heated up and are far from over.

X Google braced for questions as more big brands pull adverts M&S, Sky, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS latest to pull ads after they were put beside extremist material Mon, Mar 20, 2017, 07:15 Updated: Mon, Mar 20, 2017, 17:20 Rob Davies Major brands who have pulled their ads include McDonald’s, L’Oreal, Audi and the BBC, while UK government spending has also been suspended. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Wire         Google executives are bracing for a two-pronged inquisition from the advertising industry and UK government over the company’s plans to stop ads being placed next to extremist material. A slew of big-name companies, advertising firms and government departments have either pulled their adverts from Google and its YouTube video site, or are considering whether to do so. UK retailer Marks and Spencer became the latest brand to pull advertising from Google, adding to pressure on the company to step up policing to prevent offensive material, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism, from appearing alongside ads. “In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through,” M&S said in a statement. The retailer acted after the UK government, the Guardian newspaper, grocer J Sainsbury and other marketers pulled advertising from YouTube. French advertising company Havas SA said it was removing certain clients’ spots from the site after it failed to get assurances that they wouldn’t appear alongside offensive videos, while media giant Sky, HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland added their names to a growing list over the weekend. Other major brands to pull their ads include McDonald’s, L’Oreal, Audi and the BBC. Tesco is understood to have “paused” spending on YouTube. The internet firm’s European head, Matt Brittin, is one of two Google executives due to speak at the annual Advertising Week Europe event, attended by every major company in the advertising world. Sources said Mr Brittin is aware he is likely to face a flurry of questions about how adverts for major brands ended up attached to videos by extremists, including hate preachers and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The ads help fund payments to the people who post the videos, with every 1,000 clicks worth about £6 (€6.92). ADVERTISEMENT Explain themselv es Mark Howe, head of Google’s agencies business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will also speak at the event. Mr Brittin will be among the first people to address delegates, speaking on Monday alongside Unilever’s chief marketing officer, Keith Weed. Unilever declined to comment on whether it had suspended advertising through Google. Mr Brittin’s appearance in front of luminaries from the advertising industry will kick off a week in which he and fellow executives will also have to explain themselves to UK government ministers. Senior figures from the company were summoned to the Cabinet Office last week over concerns that UK taxpayer-funded adverts were appearing alongside “inappropriate” YouTube videos. Google executives apologised but were told to come back to the Cabinet Office this week with a plan and a timetable to remedy the problem. Major advertisers have pulled business from the internet search engine in the past week, with Sky, becoming the latest to suspend their ads. – Guardian News and Media, Bloomber       Topics: Google HSBC L'Oréal McDonald's Royal Bank of Scotland Read More Uber hit by new turmoil as president Jeff Jones quits Angry games fans left out in the rain at Dublin’s GamerCon How to . . . save your favourite articles for later Spotify nears licensing deals which may pave way to IPO Parent company of Irish co-founded Hassle.com raises €10m Uber won court battle over drivers’ classification in December A smart Swatch?

It follows a UK government decision to remove its adverts from YouTube — which is owned by Google — after it emerged they had appeared alongside content from supporters of extremist groups, the BBC reported. RBS, Lloyds and HSBC also announced similar moves over the weekend. Google has said it does not always “get it right” and will improve. The move follows a recent investigation by The Times, London, which found adverts from a range of well-known firms and organisations had appeared alongside content from supporters of extremist groups on the YouTube video site. An ad appearing alongside a video earns the poster about 6 pounds ($8) for every 1,000 clicks it generates, meaning brands may have unwittingly contributed money to extremists. Last week, ministers summoned Google for talks at the Cabinet Office after imposing a temporary restriction on the government’s own adverts, including for military recruitment and blood donation campaigns. Others such as fastfood chain McDonald’s, beauty giant L’Oreal and luxury carmaker Audi, as well as the BBC, the Guardian and Channel 4, have suspended their advertising on both Google’s search engine and YouTube site. Sky News and Vodafone are also considering suspending their ads. –IANS ksk/vt Tags BBC content Google weekend CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts Petroleum under GST, but will apply after states agree: Jaitley Mar 23rd, 201708 New Delhi, March 23 (IANS) Petroleum products, which will be within the purview of the Goods and Services...

A report in The Times says the scandal has now reached the internet giant's home country, with US-based pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson the latest firm to remove its ads. Telecoms firms AT&T and Verizon - " the third- and fourth-largest advertisers in the United States, respectively," says TechCrunch - have also joined the boycott. It emerged last month that paid ad placements were appearing next to extremist content on YouTube and potentially generating revenue for hate preachers, terrorists and white nationalists. How was the scandal uncovered? See related  Are big brands funding terrorism and fake news? An investigation by The Times last month revealed "hundreds" of big-name companies were unwittingly funding groups including "Islamic extremists, white supremacists and pornographers". According to the paper, the ads were appearing on hate sites and next to YouTube videos created by supporters of terror groups such as Islamic State. An advert appearing alongside a YouTube video "earns the poster around £6 for every 1,000 clicks it generates", says the Independent, and as some videos can gain more than one million hits, it potentially generates tens of thousands of pounds a month for extremists. In one example uncovered by the Times, "Sandals Resorts, the luxury holiday operator, is advertised next to a video promoting al-Shabaab, the East African jihadist group affiliated to al- Qaeda". John Lewis, Waitrose and Disney also had ads appearing beside videos by hate preachers, homophobes and white nationalists. Why are the ads appearing on these extremist sites? Google places ads on YouTube videos using algorithms which track the person browsing the page, tailoring the ads based on their search history, for example. The advertising revenue usually goes to the owner of the video. Blacklists are meant to stop adverts from appearing against certain content, while YouTube is supposed to police content and take down inappropriate material. However, the analysis by the Times suggests this is not working and ads appear against content that violates Google's policies. What does Google say? "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Matt Brittin, Google's European chief, told the Advertising Week Europe conference in London. "We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously." He added that the sums paid to extremists involved had been "pennies, not pounds", but admitted "clearly we need to do more on that". He also said Google had made a public commitment to improve its placement of adverts and would spend more money on enforcement to act faster. Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blogpost: "We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." However, Labour MP Yvette Cooper told The Guardian the apology had not gone far enough. "They need to say whether they will be paying back any of that advertising revenue and to answer our questions on what more they are doing to root out extremism or illegal activity on YouTube because they are still failing to do enough to remove illegal or hate-filled content from YouTube." Google is now facing a "two-pronged attack", says The Guardian, with both advertising regulators and the government prepared to ask awkward questions about how much control brands and Google itself can exercise over where ads are generated online. Questions are also being asked about the role of ad agencies, with some manufacturers saying they were unaware their adverts could appear next to extremist content and accusing their advertisers of keeping them in the dark about how their money was spent.

Clients don't like to be associated with jihadis and racists 20 Mar 2017 at 12:00, Andrew Orlowski Google has promised a review of its ad policy on YouTube after a backlash from blue-chip advertisers. It follows a series of reports by The Times demonstrating big brand ads running over content that breaches YouTube guidelines, such as jihadist videos and other inflammatory or racist material. French advertising giant Havas "paused" its UK ad spend with YouTube on Friday, reportedly £35m a year, and the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and HSBC followed suit at the weekend. The Cabinet Office halted its YouTube spending last week. The Metropolitan Police and The Guardian had also inadvertently been helping to fund the video producers. Havas becomes the first of the global marketing groups to pull all its UK ad spend from Google/YT. Clients incl. O2, BBC, Royal Mail. £175m — Mark Sweney (@marksweney) March 17, 2017 To be clear, @Havas_MGUK has 'paused' only YT & GDN activity & is working closely with Google to find a solution before un-pausing ad spend. — Paul Frampton Calero (@Paul_Framp) March 17, 2017 Havas represents 240 clients in the UK, including the BBC, O2 and the Royal Mail. Not all ad agencies have hit pause. However, YouTube's prominence as the world's number-two ranking site (after Google's own search page) has left ad spenders with a dilemma. Because visitors spend considerable time on the site, chances are almost every visitor will see an advertisement. Oops Yet there's more to the agency boycott than meets the eye. The story isn't new. Evidence of Google "monetising" jihadi videos on YouTube – thereby providing a source of funding to dubious groups – appeared on BBC's Newsnight three years ago, and musicians have been complaining about big brand ads running alongside pirate material for even longer. Responding to their concerns, Google's Theo Bertram promised to "drain the swamp of dodgy networks, dodgy agencies and dodgy sites". Yet by 2015 Google was explaining to policy experts that the hate material offered a "messaging" opportunity. "We don't believe that censoring the existence of ISIS on Google, YouTube or social media will dampen their impact really," said Google's chief counsel David Drummond. "We have to reach at-risk youth all over the world and divert them from hate and radicalisation," Drummond told an ad conference in Cannes in 2015. For its part, the ad business has seen its expensive intermediary role usurped by the two vertically integrated networks of Google and Facebook, and responded by aping them. Th open market now offers media buyers programmatic tools similar to the in-house placement offered by the Silicon Valley duopoly. But it isn't working.

As it stands today, video attachments in Gmail (for web) have to be downloaded first and then they can be opened using a media player. This is not the most convenient way to watch videos. When you have links from YouTube for instance, you can directly stream from your Gmail account. Google wants to use this technology for all the videos that are shared in Gmail. Now, when you see the thumbnail of the video, clicking on it will let you start streaming it. You will no longer need to separately download it and see it. Emails with video attachments, will show a thumbnail and you’ll be able to stream it from inside Gmail. This uses the same infrastructure as is used for YouTube or Google Drive, so that video is delivered at an optimum quality. The feature will be available to Gmail web users in the next fortnight. There is no idea if the feature will be seen on the mobile Gmail app as well. Earlier this month, Google announced in a blog post that it is increasing the attachment limit of Gmail up from 25MB to 50MB. However, one important thing to note here is that the increased limit is only reflected while receiving emails. Gmail users can now receive emails of up to 50MB directly while the sending limit is still fixed at 25MB.

Ostara is the name given by Pagans and Wiccans to the spring equinox and is one of the eight ‘sabbats’ – periods they believe make up the year.  Some observers believe the event is a revival of ancient celebrations of spring, which merged into Easter after the spread of Christianity in the British Isles.  Modern observers often see in Ostara at Stonehenge, in a similar fashion to the summer and winter solstices.  When is daylight savings? In the UK the clocks will ‘spring forward’ on Sunday, 26 March at 1am.  Read more All you need to know about Winter solstice 2016 Thousands travel to Stonehenge for the Summer Solstice It's not just neo-pagans like me who should be connecting with nature Can you balance an egg? This unusual question stems from the urban myth that it is possible to stand an egg on its end during the first day of spring. Proponents say this is because of a unique gravitational pull which occurs at this time of year. But this is untrue. There is no change to the Earth’s gravitational pull during the spring equinox – or any other day. It is possible to balance an egg on its end, but, with the right know how, this is possible any time of the year.  What happens on the vernal equinox? The vernal equinox is the astrological name for the spring equinox. It marks the moment the sun crosses the equator from south to north. It occurred at 10.29 GMT. Google Doodle Celebrates Its 16th Birthday What is the solstice? The equinox differs from the solstices, which occur twice yearly to mark the sun’s most northern or southern position relative to the equator.  This year, the summer solstice falls on Wednesday, 21 June, while the winter solstice is on Thursday, 21 December.

For users living north of the equator, Google's homepage features an animated short starring a mouse waking up to grab a yellow flower from outside to display inside his underground home. For those living south of the equator, Google's homepage display's a similar animated short with the mouse now venturing outside to jump into a pile of leaves before returning home to enjoy a warm cup of tea. "The word equinox comes from the Latin for equal and night. Almost everywhere in the world today, nighttime and daytime are each 12 hours," Google writes. "We use the equinox to mark the change of seasons, as the balance of light shifts to make for longer days or nights. It usually means that it's time to hunker down for colder seasons, or time to rise and shine for warmer ones, as in the case of our furry friend the mouse!" Google said, noting how during the equinox the sun rises directly in the east and sets directly in the west.

March 20, 2017 Samantha Sine KEYWORDS digital marketing / HVAC contractors / HVAC sales / social media Reprints No Comments Birds are chirping, bees are buzzing, and baseballs are flying over fences. That can only mean one thing: spring has arrived. And crops aren’t the only things budding. According to Chisult Insight Co. Ltd.’s Global and U.S. HVAC Market Research Report, the U.S. HVAC market is estimated to achieve 5 percent growth in 2017. Much like gardens need fertilization to bear fruit, HVAC companies require constant investments to flourish. The NEWS asked contractors how they were concentrating their investments in 2017. Their answers may surprise you. ONLINE PRESENCE From social media, pay-to-play click advertising, email marketing, and more, HVAC contractors have multiple opportunities to elevate their online visibility. Social media remains a hot commodity, and it’s not going away any time soon. According to estimates from eMarketer, spending on digital ads in the U.S. will likely grow this year to the point where more money is spent online than is spent on television, the former Goliath of the industry. Only behind Google, Facebook is the lead contender when it comes to digital advertising. According to Facebook, 16 million local business pages have been created since May 2013, which is a 100 percent increase from 8 million in June 2012. With statistics like these, it’s easy to see why more and more contractors are advertising their services on social media sites. John Aliano, general manager, American Residential Services, Omaha, Nebraska, has delved deeply into social media to increase visibility. “We are heavy on social media and constantly doing what we can to increase our SEO [search engine optimization] strength,” he said. With the abundance of social media platforms available, it’s important to select the proper channel for your business, which isn’t always an easy feat. And, while it may seem antiquated, email marketing is still viable. “Our online reputation is working quite well,” said Paul Sammataro, owner of Samm’s Heating and Cooling, Plano, Texas, who utilizes email marketing along with social media advertising. “While we’re going to continue our email marketing and online pay-per-click advertising, we’re aiming to get away from direct mail marketing a little more this year.” Many contractors are aligning with Sammataro and giving pay-per-click (PPC) advertising a try. PPC is a model of internet marketing in which advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. Essentially, it’s a way of buying visits to your site, rather than attempting to earn those visits organically. This is yet another step for a company to get its company in front of customers seeking HVAC services online. While you have to pay to play, it is an effective way to increase online traffic and has become an attractive option for contractors nationwide. “The most successful HVAC contractors in the country understand that winning online is about cost-effectively maximizing your real estate — starting with search engines,” said Ben Landers, president of Blue Corona, a web marketing, analytics, and optimization company. “Consumers using Google demonstrate their interest and intent with the keyword phrases they use. Not everyone on Facebook is in the market for a new furnace, but virtually everyone searching ‘cost of furnace replacement [city, state]’ is. “To maximize your search engine real estate, you must intelligently invest in SEO and PPC,” Landers continued.  “And, while recent Google changes are largely overlooked by some business owners and marketers, they make PPC advertising even more important for local HVAC contractors.” REVIEWS AND REFERRALS Many HVAC contractors have reported great returns by encouraging customers to leave reviews. Reviews give contractors a chance to spotlight why their businesses are superior, connect with customers, heap praise, and learn how and where they need to improve. Will Merritt, managing partner, Effective Media Solutions, asks customers to rate their service experience on a regular basis. “If they had a great customer service experience, we send them a link directly to the contractor’s Google reviews page. The link takes them exactly where they can leave a review, no extra steps or clicks; it’s that easy. If there was a problem, we offer them a link to a hidden landing page on the contractor’s website. The customer’s comments then go directly to the HVAC company and are not seen by the general public. Reviews are also a key component Google looks at for organic rankings for your website.” “We listen to our customers on how they review us on our survey sheets,” said Aliano. “We pull good ideas from other service industries and insert them into our business.”  Consumers are frequently turning to review sites to learn more about businesses prior to enlisting their services.  This has become an integral part of the modern-day shopping experience. Presenting superior service via positive online reviews can take a business to new heights. Positive reviews can be further strengthened with referrals. Referral programs are popping up left and right in the HVAC industry. They help customers see the value of doing business with you. If they are rewarded for doing business with your company, they are more inclined to stick with you for the long haul. For Rob Minnick, CEO and president of Minnick’s Inc., Laurel, Maryland, his referral program is beneficial to new and repeat customers. “Our referral program is tied into our VIP rewards program. We give customers who give referrals 100 points, which is valued at $100. These points can be used toward any service Minnick’s provides. We also do the same for new customers, though new customers need to have a service done before the points are activated.” Merritt says a few simple things can drive referrals: “Offer a coupon for future services, a gift card for their favorite restaurant, or a donation to their charity of choice. Referrals are a must for heating and air conditioning companies. Heating and air conditioning services are out of sight and out of mind to consumers except when they need you. So, capitalize on the opportunity when you come out and fix their problems because, at that moment in time, you are their hero. So, it’s time to use that to your advantage.” TRAINING AND RECRUITING In order to grow this year, many HVAC technicians are making an effort to recruit and train technicians. With a known shortage of technicians, new efforts are being made in the recruiting process. “We’ve reached out to high school seniors and have talked to them via roundtable meetings,” said Hank Bloom, owner, Environmental Conditioning Systems, Mentor, Ohio. “We just hired one of them who went to the local trade school. Some of our top leaders are on boards of different trade schools. We have hired directly out of trade schools with a one out of three success rating.” Reaching out to trade schools is inevitably still a huge recruiting method, but contractors are now taking it a step further in order to reach new demographics. “Goettl Air Conditioning is hiring new technicians,” said Ken Goodrich, CEO, Goettl Air Conditioning, Tempe, Arizona. “We seek prospects from many sources, including trade schools, competitors, out-of-state recruits, and veterans.” Some contractors offer their employees significant spiffs anytime they successfully recruit new hires. “We have increased our employees’ referral program to $5,000 when they refer a new employee,” said Minnick. Recruiting is a constant for many contractors, especially with there being a shortage. Therefore, many contractors are recruiting nonstop in order to grow their businesses for the 2017 year. “I have not stopped recruiting in the last six months, and I have no plans to slow down,” said Steve Moon, owner, Moon Services Inc., Elkton, Maryland. “I am targeting smart people with great attitudes.” Furthermore, many contractors are seeking out women for all positions. Travis Smith, owner, Sky Heating and Cooling, Portland, Oregon, is always willing to consider female candidates. “We’re always encouraging women to join our company,” he said. “I think there is a huge opportunity for women to join this industry. I know many stay-at-home wives have said they would feel more comfortable with a female technician.” Bloom is also recruiting women and has several working for him already. “We have always encouraged women to join our company,” he said. “They’re perfect for our industry but are hard to find.” Once contractors find technicians, it’s key to their success to train them continuously as technology and policies are always changing. Whether conducted in-house or through a manufacturer, contractors are making sure technicians are properly and continuously trained. Trained and skilled technicians ensure customer satisfaction and retention. “Having the most well-trained technicians will reduce callbacks, increase the customer experience, and bring us referrals,” said Smith. Contractors are tasked with much more than just training technicians on new technologies and the technical aspects of their jobs. “Goettl Air Conditioning holds training for our technicians every day,” Goodrich said. “We train our technicians on new skills, technologies, communication, new services, and more. We also cross-train technicians with exceptional skills in areas to help train their colleagues, which helps raise the team to new standards. We also engage outside sources, such as industry specialists, to provide training.” Training is critical to Moon’s business. This year, he plans on expanding on that training even more. “We now not only pay for our technicians’ training but we pay them to go to training. We also are bringing in trainers in-house. We’re encouraging our managers to be more hands-on in the field. This ensures we are all doing things the same way and have a consistent product across our markets and install crews.” So, if you’re an owner looking to make  2017 your best year yet, with ample amounts of growth, focus on your online presence, reviews, referrals, training, and recruiting. Once you’ve mastered these facets of your business, you’ve set yourself up for great returns.    Publication date: 3/20/2017 Want more HVAC industry news and information?

Last week TAG Heuer unveiled the new generation of a $1650 (R21000) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the $890 Summit. This week Swatch Group chief executive Officer Nick Hayek also announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers in the middle of the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank.

Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15000.  Swiss watchmakers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel - Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines - have stayed out of the smartwatch market. Read also: Swatch takes on Apple, Google The releases represents a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont chairperson Johann Rupert has said his brands planned to make only “intelligent watchstraps” and putting electronic functions into the watch case created a danger of obsolescence for time-honoured watchmaking practices. Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution”. TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1650 that can swop the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Failures Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and last month Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Smartwatches from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17000 luxury version of the Apple Watch, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IDC estimates that 19.8million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a forecast of 28.3million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9percent last year while shipments at Samsung rose 39percent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches last year, says the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19months of declining exports. This week Swatch forecast a rebound in US and European markets. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got less than than 10percent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch last year. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he says. Otherwise, they risk lower-priced timepieces undercutting their sales.  Bloomberg Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Disgraced former SABC executive in line for top job 2 Black woman, you're on your own 3 Former Miss SA forces couple to apologise for 'monkey' slur 4 #ORTamboHeist: Lambo owner is no thief, says lawyer 5 PICS: London attack death toll rises to 5 Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Published on March 20, 2017. Most Popular Do you think there's any correlation between a less-than-robust economy and marketers' increased reliance on digital commerce and advertising? The 21st century hasn't been very cooperative so far. David Brooks, columnist for The New York Times, says the current time period is "looking much nastier and bumpier" than the 20th century. "Rising ethnic nationalism, falling faith in democracy, a dissolving world order." And, I would add, the 21st century marks the rise and absolute domination of the internet. The internet has been playing havoc with all sorts of traditional businesses, from retailing to the media. And about all we've got to show for the disruption is Amazon, Google and Facebook. And competitors find it exceedingly difficult to compete against Google and Facebook. Chuck Townsend, the retired chairman of Condé Nast, told me last year that he was "really disappointed" in the amount of digital advertising Condé Nast had generated -- a little more than 15% of ad revenues. That's why the company has teamed up with NBC Universal and Vox Media to collectively deliver 200 million web visitors, about double the Condé Nast number. What other $80 billion business doesn't know if its product is even seen or is effective in selling merchandise? What other business treats fraud as a necessary expense? And what other business is dominated by two gigantic ad platforms in Google and Facebook, with everybody else getting the crumbs? And speaking of crumbs, consumers sure don't seem to be in a buying mode. Many of the top brands are showing declines as consumers look for healthier and more innovative items. It doesn't help that many digital advertisers seem to be conceding that their products will interest only consumers who are already sold on them. So brand building is taking a backseat, and marketers are pumping more and more of their money into digital ads, focusing intently on their most avid buyers by following their every move around the internet. Casual or indifferent buyers are ignored. Procter & Gamble, for one, has come to the conclusion that it is missing out on building its brands by not stretching for a broader reach. P&G's focus is now on "reach and continuity," said Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, with brands such as Tide, Pampers and Febreze increasing reach 10% to 20% in the U.S. while still focusing on their most important consumer segments. That effort has included "shifting to more broadly appealing television shows and also higher–reach digital platforms," Ad Age reported. P&G is also scaling back on targeted Facebook advertising because it wasn't helping it reach enough new customers. Maybe Facebook should start a new service going beyond "likes" and catering to the much broader segment of "take it or leave its" or even the more lackadaisical "so whats?" The point is marketers, to grow in a non-growth environment, need to become more aggressive in building their brands by reaching out to once-in-a-while churchgoers rather than preaching to the choir over and over again. Kraft Heinz, meanwhile, is not simply making small adjustments. The company, the product of a 2015 merger, is a proponent of the slash-and-burn style of management. As The Wall Street Journal said, the company "is motivated by an inexorable logic. There is little growth in consumer products, so the model appears to be: buy, cut costs and buy again. Kraft Heinz believes it needs a big new target. It will likely prove a determined hunter." You would think that this approach, which encompasses zero-based budgeting, would prove devastating to ad spending, but at Kraft Heinz they seem to be cutting so they'll have more money for advertising. A year ago, the company said it would increase "working media" by $50 million and cut back on "nonworking" media such as production (as P&G has done). What's actually happened in the last year is surprising -- at least to me. I asked our crack Ad Age Datacenter crew -- Kevin Brown and Brad Johnson -- along with reporter Jessica Wohl, to look into what Kraft Heinz actually spent on advertising during 2016, fully expecting that it couldn't resist chopping ads to bolster the bottom line. But here's what they found: Kraft Heinz "appears to have met -- and exceeded" its plan to increase its U.S. working media budget by $50 million in 2016, Brad told me. He said the company's measured media spending rose by $92 million, or 19.2%, in the first 11 months of 2016 versus the same period in 2015, according to our analysis of data from Kantar Media. Since Kraft Heinz is fixated on increasing its operating margins, you've got to figure that its increased ad spending paid off by selling more high-margin products (unless it got the extra money by drastically lowering its production costs -- maybe it shot its TV commercials on an iPhone). In addition to a big Heinz "Meet the Ketchups" Super Bowl campaign, the company spent money on cleaner formulations of well-known products, such as Capri Sun Organic and Kraft macaroni and cheese with no artificial flavors, preservatives or synthetic colors. In 2017, the company said it would focus on three key brands -- Heinz, Kraft and Planters -- and on five categories with global potential: condiments and sauces, cheese, meals, nuts and baby food -- with plans for "significant incremental investment in marketing." It would have been very interesting to observe how the Kraft Heinz-Unilever amalgamation would have panned out. Last year, Unilever reduced its "brand marketing investment" as a percentage of sales, enabling the company to improve its operating margin. Maybe Kraft Heinz can show the Unilever people how they can have higher margins and still spend more money on advertising, and why I'm guessing Kraft Heinz will continue to be a "determined hunter" of Unilever and why P&G will also be paying close attention.

In a video posted on Twitter, it then talked about the plot and suggested asking it about main character Belle for “more movie fun”. Google denied that the material on Home was an advertisement. It appeared as part of a “My Day” feature where the digital assistant provides an update which can include calendar events and news bulletins. “This wasn’t intended to be an ad,” said a spokeswoman. “What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. “We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” On its website Google demonstrates the My Day feature. The device is not yet available outside the US. The tech giant has experimented before with including what it calls “seasonal timely content” on the Google Home device without it being requested. Previous material on the themes of Black History Month and the Oscars has also run. ‘Tricky conundrum’ The rise of digital assistants presents a “tricky conundrum” for advertising sales, said analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight. “Unlike adverts inserted on a screen which can be glossed over, anything presented in an audio format risks being incredibly intrusive,” he said. “The most likely outcome will be that there would be ad-funded voice assistants where the user gets a discounted device in return for accepting adverts.” He added that Google faces a different challenge to Amazon, which markets rival home assistant the Amazon Echo. “Google’s primary business model is predicated on advertising,” he said. “Whereas for Amazon its about transactional revenue where a voice assistant like Echo can help drive sales.” – More General News | Latest News Comments No Comment Leave your Comment Do you have an story for publication?

(Source: CNN/Google) AMBRYM, VANUATU (CNN/Google) - Google this: “What’s it like to go inside a volcano?” The web giant recently sent a crew to find out - all the way to Vanuatu, an archipelago located in the South Pacific that’s more than 1,000 miles off the coast of Australia. The tiny island nation is home to lush jungles, black sand beaches, and nine active volcanoes. Google partnered with explorers Geoff Mackley and Chris Horsley to go inside one of them. They got a view of the volcano like no one’s ever seen before. The team traveled to the island of Ambrym, home to two volcanoes, BenBow and Marum. The chief of the local village calls the unpredictable and dangerous volcanoes “devils,” but their natural beauty is undeniable. “It;s so vast and such and incredible landscape,” Horsley said. “There’s a real heartwarming feeling that you get when you see the lava lake itself. It’s an incredible feeling.” Strapping on a high-tech backpack called the Trekker, Horsley and Mackley rappelled down 400 meters - about 437 yards - inside the Marum crater to collect 360 degree Google “Street View” imagery. They got an up-close look at the volcano’s giant lake of lava, a fiery cauldron of boiling rock that’s roughly twice the size of a football field. “Standing just meters away from one of the most active lava lakes in the world really surges energy through your whole body,” Horsley said. “It is like staring into the sun or the heartbeat of the planet, really.” And now, people all over the world can visit the volcano, too - vicariously and safely from the comfort of their homes - using Google’s website.

WordPress Gets 5K Takedown Requests, Google Gets a Lot More for WP Sites GO Copyright holders aren't too successful either way Mar 20, 2017 11:11 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  WordPress is one of the largest blogging platforms in the world and, in this role, it's not surprising that it receives quite a few takedown notices for various pages its users post. What is surprising, however, is that it gets a lot less than Google does for WordPress pages.  In Automattic's transparency report we find that in the second half of last year, they received 5,006 takedown requests, which is about the amount Google gets while an engineer boils water for their coffee. The number is in no way small, but it pales in comparison with the numbers Google gets. In fact, it was a while back that Google said it was asked to remove 1,500 links per minute. Automattic's report shows that out of the number of links it is asked to remove, it only takes down about half, which is consistent with numbers over the past few years. TorrentFreak points out, however, that Google receives more takedown requests for WordPress.com than Automattic does. In fact, in the past year, copyright holders asked Google to take down over 13,000 WordPress URLs, compared to less than 10,000 sent to Automattic. This makes little sense. Twisted way to get things done If copyright holders really cared about the content that someone is allegedly infringing upon, they'd go to the target and ask those responsible to take it down. Instead, they choose to take down search engine results, which isn't exactly the most logical way to go about things. "Those numbers aren't entirely surprising for a few reasons. When looking to limit access to material online, complaints will naturally look for the path of least resistance," Automattic told TorrentFreak. Automattic says it scrutinizes every single DMCA takedown notice for formal validity and fair use considerations, so removal is not guaranteed. Google, on the other hand, has an automated process and there are higher chances the links will disappear than for WordPress to actually take them down. Not by much, however. Google appears to have whitelisted the blogging platform so only 0.3% of the 13,100 takedown requests received over the past year have been removed. #WordPress#Google#Automattic#DMCA#copyright subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news WordPress Launches Add-On, Supports Collaborative Editing in Google Docs Mozilla Announces Quantum, a New Browser Engine for Firefox Infographic: WordPress Is by Far the Most Used CMS of 2016 Nazi Anthem at the Core of YouTube Copyright Brawl Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows    WordPress gets less takedown requests than Google does for its sites New Apps Starus Photo Recovery: A handy and easy to use wizard application that helps you recover lost or deleted image files from your hard drive or flash devices OESIS Endpoint Assessment Tool: Manage and actively monitor installed applications and uninstall security software, such as antivirus and anti-spyware tools by eliminating all leftovers to make room for a new tool Velocity: Get instant access to over 150 API documentation sets for the most popular programming languages out there with the help of this highly useful app Venta4Net: Advanced network solution for fax and voice mail exchange via a modem or Internet telephony, featuring auto-answer, restricted user permissions, and more Portable Bank2PDF: Transfer information from QIF, QFX, QBO or OFX files to PDF with this intuitive application that allows you to filter source transactions Portable CintaNotes: Manage your notes, to-do lists and reminders directly on your USB flash drive or any other kind of removable device with this portable application CintaNotes: Manage personal notes, such as to-do lists, ideas and article fragments in an organized environment using this user-friendly application Reader comments Google and YouTube Celebrate International Women's Day more on: Google i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

 Google Europe boss apologizes for ads appearing next to extremist YouTube videos — but insists it was 'pennies not pounds' at stake Lara O'Reilly Mar. 20, 2017, 7:13 AM 1,138 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google EMEA boss Matt Brittin. YouTube LONDON — Google's EMEA chief Matt Brittin said on Monday the issue of brand ads appearing next to questionable — and sometimes extremist — content on YouTube is affecting "pennies, not pounds" of their spend, but promised an announcement about how the company plans to tackle the issue in "the coming days." A growing number of brands in the UK — including the government, L'Oreal, McDonald's UK, HSBC, and ad agency Havas UK on behalf of all of its clients — suspended their advertising from YouTube and Google this week over fears their ads were appearing next to questionable content and funding their creators. Google's executives were summoned to appear in front of the UK government last week after ads for taxpayer-funded services were found next to extremist videos, following an investigation by The Times newspaper. Google must return later this week with a timetable for the work it is doing to prevent the issue from occurring again. On Monday, at a breakfast briefing with journalists before he took to the stage at Advertising Week Europe — Brittin said the annual ad industry event gave Google a "good opportunity to say first and foremost, sorry, this should not happen, and we need to do better."  Brittin added: "There are brands who have reached out to us and are talking to our teams about whether they are affected or concerned by this. I have spoken personally to a number of advertisers over the last few days as well. Those that I have spoken to, by the way, we have been talking about a handful of impressions and pennies not pounds of spend — that's in the case of the ones I've spoken to at least. However small or big the issue, it's an important issue that we address." The advertiser boycott of YouTube has mainly been limited to brands' UK spend, but Brittin conceded that the company is "having a conversation with global players as well," and that any updates it makes to its systems would be effective worldwide. A "comprehensive review" is under way that has "accelerated" in recent days, Brittin said, adding the company had invested "millions" and has thousands of people who work on policies, controls, and enforcement to ensure bad ads — or bad ad placements — don't make it into the system. However, Brittin explained that the issue of brand safety is not as simple as it may seem. If Google excluded any content related to "war" from YouTube, for example, that would also exclude important documentary content about war zones. Some 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute and thousands of sites are added to the AdSense network each day, which makes policing difficult. And Google has no intentions of curtailing the free speech of its users. Brittin said: "It's not our job to be a censor, it's for the government. So you will find online content that you violently disagree with, that you find incredibly distasteful, but that is a legitimate point of view and not illegal. And that is one of the joys of the web and the voices that are there. That's different to the issue of what's safe for advertisers, which is more tightly defined." Brittin said Google plans to "raise the bar" when it comes to the policies that decide which content on its platforms is safe for advertising. Google will also make its advertiser controls easier to use, including changing some of the default settings to be more stringent on brand safety. Brittin added 98% of content that does not meet its policies is removed within 24 hours, but he added that "we can get better on that as well." Google declined to provide a timetable on when the changes will be announced, but Brittin said the company would provide more detail "in the coming days." UK advertiser trade body ISBA suggested last week that one solution to the brand safety problem on YouTube could be to put all newly uploaded content in quarantine until Google manually classifies that it is appropriate to serve ads against it. When Business Insider put that solution to Brittin, he responded: "That's a kind of example of the kind of things we are looking at all the time. We don't want to go into too much detail because one of the challenges for us is that we want to have a system that works, but you don't want to have a system that's easy to game for people. We don't want to say too much about what we are considering and rolling in or out." But he added: "I think that's a really helpful example of ISBA thinking about how can you improve on this and it demonstrates the kind of dialog we are having with them, with the big agencies, with advertisers large and small to look at how we can improve. It's a really thoughtful suggestion and we are looking at a range of things: controls, policies, and enforcement." Brand ads appearing in inappropriate places online is not a new phenomenon, but the issue was thrust into the spotlight after an investigation from The Times in February found a number of big brand ads were appearing next to violent or hateful content on YouTube. Those brands were also inadvertently funding the content creators through YouTube's ad revenue share scheme. The issue is not just confined to Google, but programmatic advertising in general. When brands pay for online ad campaigns, they usually do not buy each ad placement individually. Instead, they use a method called programmatic that uses automated systems to target large audiences across a swathe of websites or different YouTube videos. Programmatic advertising is seen as an efficient way to reach specific audiences online, but it can also risk some ads inadvertently appearing next to undesirable content if proper whitelists, blacklists, and other safety checks are not put in place by both the ad platform and the ad buyer.  Get the latest Google stock price here.

But the crisis of trust is not confined to the digital sphere. Across the media industry, relationships are becoming fractious, with mounting distrust between brands and their advertising agencies, while newspapers and TV stations are battling for ad revenues with Google and Facebook. These issues dominated the Guardian Changing Media Summit 2017, held in London on 15-16 March. Leading figures from the world of media addressed the loss of trust and a range of problems, such as advertising fraud, viewability and ad placement. More than 700 delegates from newspaper publishers, TV stations, digital platforms and media and advertising agencies attended sessions that sought solutions to these problems. The issue of digital advertising fraud was a hot topic. There was a heated debate about digital ads being placed on unsuitable websites. A recent newspaper investigation found that automated systems were placing ads from leading brands on inappropriate sites, such as those promoting violent jihadism. “A lot of brands are appearing in a lot of bad places,” Johnny Hornby, founder of agency The&Partnership told a session on ad fraud. He highlighted research from his agency and fraud detection specialist Adloox showing that digital advertising is predicted to hit $80bn (£65bn) globally this year, of which $16bn could be fraudulent. For instance, online users are fraudulently redirected to fake websites, which take payment for advertising viewed. Hornby advised brands to use verification software to identify where their ads appear online. He felt much of the blame for the problems lies with Google and Facebook, which control the lion’s share of online advertising. He called for a strike by advertisers if the problem is not resolved: “The industry needs to get together, clients and agencies, and we need to do something. If Google and Facebook – which will be 60% or 70% of that $80bn – won’t do something about this, we are going to do something, which is we aren’t going to advertise with you for a quarter or a month.” Whether such a boycott of Google and Facebook would reduce fraud and inappropriate ad placement is open to question, but the call shows how seriously brands and agencies take the problem. Meanwhile, a huge threat to the credibility of digital media is fake news. Using clickbait headlines to draw in viewers, the fake news sites make money from digital advertising. Accusations of fakery are undermining public trust in news media generally. Fake news is a threat not only to media organisations but to society in general, as the Guardian’s chief revenue officer, Hamish Nicklin, told one of the sessions: “In a world where the most powerful people on the planet are using fake news and alternative facts as weapons to undermine truth and those values so many of us hold so dear, it is clear that the truth itself needs some protection.” The events of the past year – with the election of Donald Trump as US president and the Brexit referendum – have driven up visits to established news sites. The Guardian has seen traffic increase more than 33% in 2017 compared with 2015, to more than 30m page views a day in the first months of this year. So what can be done about fake news? One suggestion was for Google and Facebook to provide information about the sources of news – such as how long they have existed (fake news sites spring up weekly) and their credibility rating. Facebook’s director of media partnerships for EMEA, Patrick Walker, told one of the sessions: “We take fake news very seriously – we appreciate that people’s reliance on Facebook for news has increased dramatically.” He said the social network is making it easier for users to report fake stories. And it has created a system of third-party fact-checking where journalists are asked to check whether a story is true. Stories would be flagged as “disputed”. The company is also looking at suggesting alternative news sources when controversial stories arise in users’ news feeds. In a separate session, Jeff Jarvis, a professor of media at CUNY’s Graduate School of Journalism, told the summit that the liberal media had some responsibility for the rise of Donald Trump and rightwing populism because it had failed to empathise with the experience of conservative Americans. “We did not reflect their world view,” he said. “We in liberal media left a vacuum that was readily filled by Murdoch and Breitbart and Drudge.” But one audience member from India warned of the dangers of empathising with nationalist and populist viewpoints. “You have empathy for the other point of view and the other point of view has become more strident, more abusive, more aggressive,” she said: “It emboldens them to more bad behaviour.” Jarvis replied: “I am not suggesting we embolden them by accepting the message they have, we have got to understand their world.” Topics Changing Media Summit Changing Media Summit 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media selected crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Media › Changing Media Summit back to top UK US world science politics business Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

One product involves cameras and augmented reality, the futuristic tech that overlays virtual objects onto the real world. Evidence suggests Building 8 is also working on a drone. Building 8 will include a big retail push complete with warehouse operations, different retail experiences, and a “global contact center footprint.” The all-start roster of tech veterans that Facebook began assembling one year ago is quietly making progress, steadily expanding the size of its ranks and the hardware prototypes under development. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 140.84 -0.63 -0.45% Snap-on Inc SNA ▲ 167.37 +0.24 +0.14% Piper Jaffray Cos PJC ▼ 63.05 -0.15 -0.24% The group, known as Building 8, currently has four simultaneous projects underway, spanning everything from cameras and augmented reality to science fiction-like brain scanning technology, Business Insider has learned. And Facebook is already thinking about the coming out party for its impending family of gadgets, laying the groundwork to drum up interest and sell the products when the time is right. Building 8 has yet to unveil any of its products, but people familiar with the matter said the hardware group is expected to play a key role in Facebook’s developer conference next month, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave his 10-year vision for the company last year. To be part of this next wave, they’ve got to get real and hurry. The move to hardware is an ambitious and risky adventure for Facebook, which reigns as an internet superpower thanks to its nearly 2 billion users. With virtually no experience in the world of hardware, Facebook is taking on deep-pocketed competitors like Apple, Google and upstarts such as Snap, in a cut-throat business defined by thin profit margins and complex logistics.  And Facebook doesn't appear to be treating Building 8 like a hobby. An analysis of Building 8’s recent hires and job listings by Business Insider, as well as conversations with people close to the company, shows an ambitious effort to create and sell millions of consumer hardware units, from a supply chain outpost in Hong Kong to a planned retail push and customer call center operation. Facebook declined to comment for this story.  Cardiologists and prosthetics One of the current Building 8 projects involves cameras and augmented reality, according to people familiar with the matter, and recent hires point to the development of a drone.  Another project involves brain-scanning technology and is lead by a former John Hopkins neuroscientist who helped develop a mind-controlled prosthetic arm. Yet another project could have medical applications, as it’s led by an interventional cardiologist from Stanford with expertise in early-stage medical device development. The group is also planning to jumpstart a fifth unspecified project, and is currently looking for the right person to lead it.  Overseeing everything is Regina Dugan, the former DARPA executive who Facebook CEO Zuckerberg poached from Google’s advanced projects division last April. Building 8 is structured similarly to Google's Advanced Technology and Projects Group, or ATAP, and is also similar to X, the “moonshot” lab where Google's self-driving cars were born.  At Building 8, technical project leads are treated like mini-CEOs and given two-year deadlines to prove a concept that will either be shipped and sold or spun out into a different part of Facebook, which also owns Oculus VR, WhatsApp, and Instagram. "He's going to help us make things fly" The first such deadline is about a year away, coming up in the summer of 2018. Frank Dellaert, a robotics and computer vision expert, is leading that project.  His involvement could suggest that Facebook is looking at making a consumer drone, something which Snapchat maker Snap Inc. has also looked into. Before he joined Facebook last summer, Dellaert was the chief scientist at Skydio, a small startup that is working on an unreleased drone that can autonomously track a person while navigating through physical space. Dellaert also served as a professor at Georgia Tech and has shown specific interest in quadcopters, according to a person familiar with his work. Additionally, Skydio’s former head of hardware, Stephen McClure, joined Facebook to be Building 8’s head of hardware in January, according to his LinkedIn profile. A handful of former GoPro employees have also joined Building 8 in recent months, including a founding member of the drone maker’s industrial design team. In a separate Facebook post announcing his hire, Building 8 chief Regina Dugan hinted at Dellaert’s aerial ambitions. “He’s going to help us make things fly… when he’s not guarding the door,” she wrote. Workers from other parts of Facebook have also been pulled in to staff Building 8. One engineer who joined last year named Alex Granieri previously worked on Aquila, Facebook’s high-altitude drone designed to beam internet connectivity to the developing world. In an August 2016 post announcing his decision to join Building 8, Frank Dellaert signaled that his Building 8 project would be over by the summer of 2018, when he planned to return and teach at Georgia Tech. “I can’t yet discuss the details of what I’ll be working on at Building 8, so stay tuned,” he wrote. “Suffice it to say, I accepted this position because of the potential impact. I'm eager to apply DARPA-style development to building hardware products at Facebook – audacious science and product development in one place? Let’s do it.” “Disruptive shopping experiences” While Building 8 is only less than a year old, the group is already ramping up plans to release its products into the wild, with multiple open “go-to-market,” retail, supply chain, and customer experience job positions listed on its website. An open retail manager position says the job will “have the responsibility of creating disruptive ground up shopping experiences of Facebook consumer hardware,” and another open partnerships lead position says the person will “build an engaging and successful 3 year partnership strategy for Building 8 retail.” The listings also indicate that Facebook plans to leverage outside partnerships to sell its products. One responsibility for the partnerships lead position is to “identify unique and inspiring collaborations that will drive innovation, impact social good, and inspire consumer loyalty and trust.” Shipping and selling consumer hardware to millions of people represents a new challenge for Facebook, which to date has only tried smaller-scale retail pushes for its expensive Oculus VR headset. Facebook’s early efforts with Building 8 are an indication that the company wants to be a serious player in augmented reality, which is considered to be the next frontier of technology, according to Loup Ventures partner Gene Munster. “They realize to be part of this next wave, they’ve got to get real and hurry,” said Munster, who was previously known for his coverage of Apple as a Piper Jaffray analyst. Munster, whose firm closely follows augmented and virtual reality companies, foresees Facebook wanting to ship at least 20 million units per year to be considered a successful consumer hardware company. Even then, he predicts that competition from the likes of larger companies like Apple and smaller incumbents like Snap Inc. will be strong. “It’s a sign that they want to be more impactful and have a seat at the table,” he said of Facebook’s hardware efforts with Building 8. “I think it’s the right thing to do, but I’m hesitant to say it will be a success.” Still, Building 8 is continuing to make hires from well-known hardware companies. The majority of Building 8’s senior leadership previously worked with Dugan at Google’s advanced technologies division, including the leadership team responsible for the shuttered Project Ara modular smartphone. Interestingly, Dugan has made a couple of Facebook posts in recent weeks that hint at what she’s focusing on within Building 8. In a post from February, she cited a statistic that 93% of “face-to-face” time between parents and their children is done by the time kids graduate high school. “Most people experience this fact like a kick in the gut,” she wrote. “Because it is a profound reminder of the power of connections. And that we can do more to increase our sense of presence beyond the remaining 7%. I’m optimistic that technology can help... it will require new advances. Including hardware advances. That are social first.” In a March post, Dugan wrote, “Smartphones have the power to connect us to people far away from us. Too often, at the expense of the people sitting right next to us. We shouldn’t have to choose.” Do you know more about what's going on in Building 8?

He writes about the post-industrial revolution, the way ideas spread, marketing, leadership and thinking differently. In an interview with Robert Bruce on Rainmaker FM, he said: “Marketers need to tell a story that resonates with your audience then spreads.” Not only that, he stated that the story needs to be true. In today’s environment of ‘false news’, I thought it was worth revisiting what it takes to buildtrust with an audience. During the interview, Godin went on further to talk about how the job of the marketer is to get attention from their audience. Due to the scarcity of attention now, you need to work harder to earn it. Also, due to past attitudes and approaches, marketers don’t get attention or trust without earning it. He said that “the internet builds connections”. Once a connection is made, it’s up to the marketer to capitalise on that connection and earn the trust necessary to make a sale. Today, one mistake on the internet can be expensive for a business. Everything is “out there” forever. If your story turns out to be false, if the promises you make are false, if your product isn’t at least average, you won’t be successful. But, before you even get a chance to be successful you need to make connections, earn attention and develop trust. MAKING CONNECTIONS Obviously, using social media is a great way to meet and get to know your audience. You need to make connections with them where they are, be it LinkedIn or Facebook. Perhaps they’re on a forum that you know about – if so, join that forum and participate. Invite comments on your blog and make the connection. Encourage them to sign up for your newsletter or email list. EARNING ATTENTION Once you’ve made a connection and someone has signed up for your newsletter, or subscribed to your blog, or followed you on social media, now is the time when you earn their attention. You cannot force them to pay attention. You’re competing with a lot of “noise”, as Seth Godin says in the interview. You’ve got to differentiate yourself from the rest and earn and keep the attention of your audience by telling a compelling and true story. Ideally one that illustrates how your product or service solves their problem. DEVELOPING TRUST As you make connections, earn attention, and tell your story, your audience will start to develop trust in you. It won’t happen overnight because these things take time. But you can speed along the process by being in the different places where your audience is, not exclusively online, and by being true to your values, goals and niche. Over time, when you do what you say you will do, word will get out, and you will have finally developed enough trust to start getting buyers. Building trust is an ongoing process that will never end as long as you’re in business. As long as you understand that and create marketing strategies and tactics that reflect that knowledge, you will differentiate yourself from others and develop your business in a sustainable way.

Meet is currently available for the web and joins Google’s lineup of business products known as G Suite.  Google plans to shut down Spaces, its group messaging tool, on April 17, 2017. In an official announcement on the Google Spaces Help page, the company states that Spaces will be read-only as of March 3, which means that users won’t be able to create new spaces, posts, or comments. Facebook launched Messenger Day, a new way to share photos and videos “as they happen” in the stand-alone Messenger app. Like with Snapchat Stories and Instagram Stories, Messenger Day allows users to customize their photos and videos with thousands of frames, effects, and stickers and each post disappears after 24 hours. Facebook updated its monetization policies for Instant Articles. Now publishers and advertisers may place ads every 250 words instead of 350 through Facebook’s Automatic Ads Placement feature. Publishers also have the option to manually place each ad into Instant Articles.  Facebook announced that it’s “beginning a test of new advanced measurement tools focused on reach and attribution” that will allow the platform to “bring the insights from Atlas to more marketers, regardless of their size.” Facebook is testing “a redesigned surface on city Pages that showcases information about [a] city… in a way that is more personalized and relevant” to specific users. The goal of this redesign is to “help people get a better sense of their city, or a city they’re visiting through their friends’ eyes” by offering “suggestions for events and places to visit in numerous cities across the globe.”  Facebook announced that reactions “will [now] affect post ranking slightly more than Likes” in the news feed algorithm because it has found reactions to be “an even stronger signal” when it comes to indicating what content users would like to see. Twitter announced Moments analytics are now available to all Twitter users on the web.  Twitter Safety released some additional updates that leverage Twitter’s technology “to reduce abusive content” and give users “more tools to control [their] experience” on the platform.  Instagram rolled out an early version of geostickers in Instagram Stories for New York City and Jakarta. There are now “more than a dozen new stickers” for each city, including unique stickers for select neighbourhoods and landmarks that are “designed to match the vibe of the location it represents.” Instagram plans to roll out more creative tools “soon,” but hasn’t yet confirmed when geostickers will be available for more destinations. Pinterest rolled out a new Pinterest browser button which allows “any image on any website… [to] be a jumping off point for discovering ideas on Pinterest.” For the first time, users can use Pinterest’s visual search technology outside of Pinterest and across the web by simply hovering over an image and selecting the magnifying tool to “instantly discover visually similar ideas on Pinterest.” There is also an option to zoom in to learn more about a specific item inside an image. Reuters reports that Facebook-owned WhatsApp is beginning to test a possible new revenue model for the messaging service with “a handful of companies that are part of the Y Combinator startup incubator.” The new system would allow businesses to “talk directly to WhatsApp users for the first time” for a fee. YouTube shared that “people around the world are now watching a billion hours of YouTube’s incredible content every single day.” The company reflects on this major milestone as representing “the enjoyment of the fantastically diverse videos that creative people make every single day” and share on the site to a global audience.

It is therefore a little troubling to see this new report detailing an apparent disregard for the aforementioned section in the United States Constitution. Due to a fraudulent transfer of $28,500 from Spire Credit Union to Bank of America by an unknown party, Edina Police Detective David Lindman filed a request for a search warrant covering certain Google search terms. While the subject of the warrant may seem bizarre, it is worth noting that the credit union used a copy of the victim's passport as proof of identity. The passport was in fact a forgery, and police spotted the image of the person whose photo was in it on the first page of a Google search. As a result, a warrant covering certain terms in people's Google search history was requested, in an attempt to identify the person who had downloaded the image for use in the fake passport. The reason given for limiting the warrant to Google, but not adding Bing or Yahoo, was that upon input of the same query into the last two search engines, the image in question could not be found. A copy of the filing obtained by Tony Webster shows the terms of this warrant: Any/all user or subscriber information related to the Google searches of: - Douglas [redacted] - Douglas [redacted] - Douglas [redacted] - Douglas [redacted] From the timeframe of December 1st, 2016 thru January 7th, 2017 The specific date/time the searches took place The user / subscriber information to include, but not limited to: name(s), address(es), telephone number(s), dates of birth, social security numbers, email addresses, payment information, account information, IP addresses, and MAC addresses of the person(s) who requested/completed the search However, this warrant granted by Hennepin County Judge Gary Larson on February 1 doesn't apply to just the residents of Edina. According to The Register, the search warrant may have been filed in the "city or township of Edina, County of Hennepin, State of Minnesota", but the extent to which it applies is unlimited. Anyone, anywhere, who has searched for the name of this victim on Google falls under this warrant. As far as privacy is concerned, this is quite a worrying development in no small part when viewed alongside the FBI's newly granted abilities, which would give even more weight to a single warrant. In an email to The Register, a Google spokesperson declared that although the company cannot comment on specific cases, it will "always push back" upon receiving "excessively broad requests for data about our users". The Electronic Frontier Foundation's criminal defense attorney, Stephanie Lacambra, called the warrant "unusual" and "overbroad" due to the lack of any other limiting factors beyond the time frame and search queries.

 Here are all the brands that have pulled spend from Google over brand safety fears Shona Ghosh, Business Insider UK Mar. 20, 2017, 6:06 AM 2,148 facebook linkedin twitter email print McDonald's UK has pulled its ads from Google. Cate Gillon/Getty Images Marks & Spencer, McDonald's UK, and Lloyds are among the many brands which have now stopped advertising on any Google-owned sites, because of the risk their ads might show up next to terrorist content, according to Sky News. They are all citing "brand safety" as the reason, which refers to the procedures involved in making sure a well-known brand's ads don't appear against violent or hateful content. These are all the brands which have suspended advertising so far, according to reports from Sky News and City AM. Some of them found their ads appearing next to inappropriate content: M&S HSBC RBS Lloyds Havas UK clients - the BBC, O2, Domino's, the Royal Mail and others The Guardian The UK government McDonald's UK L'Oreal Audi Vodafone, Barclays, and Sky are also considering pulling their ads, according to The Guardian. This all comes after a decision by the UK arm of media group Havas to suspend all advertising on Google on behalf of its clients, including O2, the Royal Mail, the BBC, and Domino's. The agency made the move after a Times investigation found household brands were inadvertently funding extremism, because their ads were showing up on hate sites.  The Times report found that ads for hundreds of big companies, universities, and charities were appearing next to YouTube videos created by sympathisers to terrorist groups like the Islamic State, and the pro-Nazi Combat 18. One ad by Mercedes appeared on a pro-Islamic State YouTube video which was viewed 115,000 times, according to the report. On Friday, Google admitted in a blog post that it could "do a better job" of ensuring households brands weren't funding hateful content. A source also told Business Insider that Google was meeting the Cabinet Office on Friday. The CEO of the world's biggest advertising agency holding company, WPP's Martin Sorrell, said Google and other major media companies like Facebook "cannot masquerade as technology companies" and needed to take their responsibilities seriously.

News Business Business News Google apologises over adverts placed next to extremist YouTube videos Marks and Spencer became the latest big name company to remove its ads, following a slew of banks, media organisations and the UK Government Ben Chapman Monday 20 March 2017 10:45 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Google has come under fire for not doing enough to actively seek and remove extremist content Getty Google’s European boss publicly apologised on Monday after a number of brands withdrew advertising from the company following revelations that their ads appeared next to extremist videos. Google’s Matt Brittin said: “I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content. We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously.” Mr Brittin said the company had made a public commitments to improve its placement of adverts and would spend more money on enforcement to act faster. Read more Big banks ditch Google over extremist YouTube videos The tech company’s problems deepened on Sunday as Marks and Spencer became the latest big name company to pull its adverts over concerns they had been placed next to extremist videos. M&S joined a slew of companies to suspend their advertising over the weekend, including HSBC, Lloyds and RBS.  M&S said it was “pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through”. The BBC, Channel 4 and The Guardian have also said they have pulled their Google ads. On Friday, French advertising group Havas, which buys ad space for a number of big companies, pulled its spend from Google, according to media reports.  Read more Google to explain why 'taxpayer-funded ads are funding extremists' Google condemned by MPs for refusing to ban anti-Semitic YouTube video Big banks ditch Google over extremist YouTube videos Havas: French ad giant 'pulls ad spend from Google and YouTube' Last week, the Government removed its Google ads and summoned the company to explain why taxpayer-funded adverts had been allowed to appear next to offensive videos. An ad appearing alongside a YouTube video earns the poster around £6 for every 1,000 clicks it generates, meaning taxpayers and global brands have unwittingly contributed funds to extremist. An investigation by The Times found ads for many leading firms had been shown alongside videos posted by extremists including David Duke, former leader of the Klu Klux Klan, as well as groups linked to Isis. Google has come under fire for not doing enough to actively seek and remove extremist content, instead often relying on users to flag material they think is offensive. The company says it is should not be treated in the same way as a traditional media company as it is merely a platform for content rather than the content provider. Google’s DoubleClick Ad Exchange service places ads through a variety of algorithms – a process in which humans have little direct involvement. Ronan Harris, a senior Google executive in the UK, said in a blog post last week that Google does its best to ensure that client ads are not published alongside offensive content.

Lynden Scourfield, 54, a manager at HBOS, forced struggling clients to use the services of his friends David Mills, 60, and Michael Bancroft, 73. In return, the two businessmen arranged sex parties, cash and lavish gifts. On Monday, the three were convicted at Southwark Crown Court on accounts including bribery, fraud and money laundering. Mark Dobson, another manager at HBOS, Alison Mills, and John Cartwright were also convicted. Getty Images 3/20 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.

Despite the minimal sentences, the ruling was described by Deltour’s lawyer as “shocking” and “a terrible anomaly.” The ruling “puts on guard future whistle-blowers,” Deltour told reporters.The LuxLeaks revelations sped beyond Luxembourg, causing European Union regulators to expand a tax-subsidy probe and propose new laws to fight corporate tax dodging, while EU lawmakers created a special committee to probe fiscal deals across the 28-nation bloc. reuters 9/20 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

AP 13/20 Panama Papers: Millions of leaked documents expose how world’s rich and powerful hid money - April 2016 Millions of confidential documents have been leaked from one of the world’s most secretive law firms, exposing how the rich and powerful have hidden their money.

George Osborne championed the deal as a “major success”. But European MEPs have since called for the Chancellor to appear in front of the committee on tax rulings to explain the tax deal. 15/20 Turing Pharmaceuticals and Martin Shkreli Martin Shkreli became known as the “most hated man in the world” after his drug company, Turing, increased the price of a 62-year-old drug that treated HIV patients by 5,000% to $750 a pill. He was charged with illegally taking stock from Retrophin, a biotechnology firm he started in 2011, and using it pay off debts from unrelated business dealings.

Around 11 million cars worldwide were affected. 17/20 Quindell, the scandal-ridden insurance firm Quindell was once a darling of AIM but its share price fell in April 2014 when its accounting practices were attacked in a stinging research note by US short seller Gotham City.

He returned to the UK in December 2012 and was arrested following a two-and-a-half year criminal investigation by the SFO. Getty Images “However, with millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right,” he said. Mr Harris admitted Google needs to “do a better job of addressing the small number of inappropriately monetised videos and content,” and that the company plans to introduce more ways for customers to control how and where their ads appear.

Credit: Ben Patterson More like this How to get started with the Google Assistant on your Android phone These are the coolest things you can do with Google Home Everything you need to know about the Google Home app Video Computex 2015: Asus ZenWatch 2 could have 4-day battery So your Marshmallow-or-better Android phone just got Google Assistant, and when you long-press the Home button for the first time after the update, your new digital helper asks, “Hi, how can I help?” Talk about an open-ended question. Read on for eight easy ways to get started with Google’s chatty servant, from telling it what to call you, to making a shopping list, to turning on Bluetooth and even playing Solitaire. Give Assistant some familiar voice commands ”Open the Kindle app,” “make an appointment for noon today,” “remind me to buy milk,” and “play some jazz”—all familiar Android voice commands from way back when, and most of them will work just fine with Google Assistant. Ben Patterson If you’re not sure where to start with Google Assistant, try a familiar Android voice command—anything from “create a calendar event” to “set a timer.” Just tap and hold the Home button, wait for Google Assistant to pop up, and then say something like, “send a text message to my wife,” “send a mail message,” or “what’s the fastest way home?” Click here for more ideas, or just ask, “What can you do?” Bonus tip: If you want to summon Google Assistant without lifting a finger, just set your phone to respond to your voice even when your handset is locked. Chat with Assistant when your phone is offline Siri, Apple’s digital assistant for iPhones and iPads, falls silent without a data connection. Not so with Google Assistant, which can still perform plenty of tasks even when you’re out of Wi-Fi and cellular range. Ben Patterson Not even airplane mode can silence your new Google Assistant. Granted, being offline cramps Google Assistant’s style somewhat—for example, it won’t be able to tell you the height of Mount Everest or which local brunch spots are worth a visit. That said, Assistant can still do things like set timers, play locally saved tunes on the Google Play Music app, and even navigate routes within an offline area in Google Maps. Scan the screen Even though Google Assistant replaces Google Screen Search (aka Google on Tap), you can still scan the current screen for relevant information. Ben Patterson Don’t worry, Google’s handy Screen Search feature didn’t get thrown out with the bath water. Similar to what you used to do with Screen Search, tap and hold the Home button, then tug up on the Google Assistant window. Once you do, you’ll see search results based on whatever’s on the screen, along with any actions (like creating appointments or making restaurant reservations) that your digital helper deems appropriate. Bonus tip: You’ll also find a Share Screenshot button below any screen scan results, another holdover from the old Screen Search feature. Tell Assistant what you’d like to be called By default, Google Assistant will call you by the first name on your contact card. If you want your digital buddy to call you something else, just say something along the lines of, “Call me Charlie.” The Assistant will ask for a confirmation before committing your new nickname to memory. Ben Patterson Google Assistant will call you by any name you want—just ask. Here’s another way to tell Google Assistant how to address you: Open the Assistant, tap the three-dot button in the top-right corner of the window, then tap Settings > Personal info > Nickname. Bonus tip: Want Google Assistant to remember the name of your spouse or another loved one? Just tell it something like, “Jane Doe is my wife.”  Ask Assistant to keep quiet Your Google Assistant speaks aloud while it’s doing your bidding, perfect while you’re driving but not ideal if you’re trying to keep quiet. Ben Patterson Google Assistant will carry out your orders in silence once you toggle on the right setting. If you like, you can set Assistant to hold its tongue whenever it’s not in hands-free mode. Just open Assistant, tap the three-dot menu button, tap Voice > Speech output, then tap Hands-free only. Order Assistant to turn on your Bluetooth (or another setting) Nope, you don’t have to open Quick Settings to enable Bluetooth on your Android phone. Just summon Google Assistant, then say, “Turn on Bluetooth.” Ben Patterson Google Assistant can take charge of many of Android’s Quick Settings, from airplane mode and Wi-Fi to Bluetooth and your phone’s flashlight. Your Assistant can also turn on your phone’s flashlight, toggle your Wi-Fi and airplane mode settings, and even mute your phone. Add items to your shopping list If you need to stock up at the grocery store, get a little help from Google Assistant. Just say, “Add bacon to my shopping list,” and your Assistant will create a shopping list in Google Keep, complete with the items you added. Ben Patterson Need to go shopping? Your Google Assistant can help. To check which Keep shopping list is linked to Google Assistant, open the Assistant, tap the three-dot button in the top-right corner of the window, then tap Settings > Shopping list. Ask Assistant to entertain you You’ll never be without a tic-tac-toe opponent with Google Assistant around. Just say, “Play tic-tac-toe” to get started with some X’s and O’s, or “Play Solitaire” for a solo card game. Ben Patterson Feeling blue? Google Assistant can brighten your day. If you’re need a pick-me-up, just say “random fun;” when you do, Google Assistant will surprise you with an inspirational quote, a cat video, or something else to make you smile.

The warrant, published by public records researcher Tony Webster, requires Google to provide a wealth of information on any internet user who was found to have searched for one of four variations of a fraud victim’s name. The rationale for the records request is to do with the specifics of the fraud case: the perpetrator attempted to initiate a $28,500 wire transfer from the victim’s account, using a fake passport as ID. That passport, according to police, was illustrated with a picture of someone with the same name as the victim. A Google image search of the victim’s name brings up that same image, the warrant says, while comparable searches using Bing and Yahoo do not. That led the police to conclude that the perpetrator likely carried out the same search, in order to find the photo in the first place. The warrant, which was approved by Judge Gary Larson in early February, calls on Google to hand over data on all searches for the victims name that took place between 1 December 2016 and 7 January 2017. That data includes names, addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, IP addresses and account information of all the people who carried out the search, according to the warrant. Any Google user in the world could potentially be covered by the warrant, which doesn’t contain any restriction as to whose data should be handed over. Webster told Ars Technica that despite pro forma language limiting the search to the town of Edina, the warrant’s demands aren’t limited to just the immediate physical environment. Whether the warrant is legally sound is a matter of some contention. Webster argues that “search warrants require supporting probable cause, not just mere suspicion or theory. “For that reason, ‘anyone-who-accessed’ search warrants… can be risky to execute, as evidence could potentially be thrown out in a pretrial motion,” he adds. “Moreover, it’s possible that such a wide net could catch completely routine and non-criminal searches of the victim’s name by neighbours, prospective employers or business associates, journalists, or friends.” Andrew Crocker, an attorney at the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, joked that the case should be renamed: “Case name should be In re Minnesota Unconstitutional General Warrant.” A Google spokesperson told Forbes that “We aren’t able to comment on specific cases, but we will always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users.” This article was amended on 20 March 2017. An earlier version suggested that the warrant applied only to people in Edina.

It came after Marks and Spencer became the latest firm to pull its online ads over the issue, joining others such as Audi, RBS and L'Oreal. Google's European chief, Matthew Brittin, promised to review the firm's policies and strengthen enforcement. But some questioned the company's commitment to tackling the issue. A recent investigation by the Times found adverts from a range of well-known firms and organisations had appeared alongside content from supporters of extremist groups on YouTube's video site. An advert appearing alongside a video earns the poster about £6 for every 1,000 clicks it generates, meaning brands may have unwittingly contributed money to extremists. The Times said that rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers were among those receiving payouts. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent There are two difficult issues for Google here - spotting videos that are illegal and should be removed from YouTube, and determining which are legal but not suitable for advertising. Pressed by reporters on whether the firm would employ people to actively hunt down extremist videos, Matt Brittin was evasive, indicating that a combination of smart technology and user alerts to harmful content was a better option. But his main challenge will be in providing more clarity to customers when it comes to deciding which videos are "ad-safe". Drawing the line won't be easy - as he pointed out, news organisations put a lot of disturbing content online but need to earn money from advertising if they are to continue to invest in journalism. Mr Brittin seems confident that by having a thorough look at its policies and showing advertisers how they can control where their messages appear, Google can regain their confidence. But the company, which insists it's a technology platform not a media business, is finding it ever harder to hold that line. Media firms face tight regulation - and that is what may be coming Google's way if it doesn't clean up its act. Read Rory's blog in full Image copyright Other Image caption Navy recruitment ads are among those believed to be affected Last week, ministers summoned Google for talks at the Cabinet Office after imposing a temporary restriction on the government's own adverts, including for military recruitment and blood donation campaigns. And on Monday M&S joined a growing list of firms to suspend their advertising from both Google's search engine and YouTube site. Others include McDonald's, HSBC, Lloyds, the BBC, Channel 4 and the Guardian. 'Not far enough' Speaking at the Advertising Week Europe conference, Mr Brittin said: "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content." He also promised that Google would exert more control over where ads were placed and improve its record for reviewing questionable content. Further details are expected later this week. However, Labour MP Yvette Cooper told the Guardian the apology had not gone far enough. "They need to say whether they will be paying back any of that advertising revenue and to answer our questions on what more they are doing to root out extremism or illegal activity on YouTube because they are still failing to do enough to remove illegal or hate-filled content from YouTube." Brian Wieser, an analyst at the brokerage Pivotal, meanwhile downgraded Google's stock on Monday, saying the scandal would curtail its profits this year. "Alphabet's Google is facing a serious issue in the UK with brand safety issues, which has global repercussions," he wrote in an analyst note. Media captionGoogle must "place these ads in the right way" Sir Martin Sorrell told Radio 4's The World at One Mark Mulligan, a media and technology consultant at Midia, told the BBC that the complaints against Google "were not new" and showed the internet was "still in its adolescence". "When the internet was founded, it was all about doing away with the gatekeeper. But now we're facing fake news and inappropriate content and that clashes with business models like Google's which are built on selling advertising." He said Google was likely to weather the storm, but that such incidents would weaken its dominance of the online advertising market. "Every incident like this gives Facebook an opportunity to steal a march on Google," he said.

RCN Corp. has begun offering superfast 1 gigabit-per-second Internet service to 18 communities around Boston, and will extend it to seven city neighborhoods later this spring. Priced at $69.99 a month, it will be the fastest offering from a local provider after a super-speed service from Comcast Corp. that costs many times more. Advertisement How fast is 1-gigabit-per-second? Enough to stream up to 200 high-definition movies simultaneously. That’s far more than the typical household would likely need, but RCN general manager Jeff Carlson said consumers’ need to move data faster is only growing. “We see the demand climbing year after year,” said Carlson. “We see people with more high-speed devices operating in the home. We see gamers wanting a better experience.” Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Internet search titan Google pioneered the 1-gigabit service with the launch of its Google Fiber project in 2010, in cities such as Nashville, Kansas City, and Salt Lake City. Google charges $70 a month for the service. Google launched its fiber network in a bid to force traditional telecom companies to offer faster Internet service at better prices. It worked. According to Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner, average broadband prices fell $15 to $20 a month in cities served by Google Fiber. In addition, rival broadband companies began offering faster download speeds. But unlike RCN and the major telecommunications companies, Google did not already have an installed network of wires and pipes, so it had to build its system from scratch. The immense cost of running fiber optic cable to thousands of homes and businesses led Google to back away from this approach last fall. Advertisement Meantime, Google acquired Webpass, a San Francisco company that uses wireless technology instead of cables to deliver high-speed Internet services to businesses and apartment buildings. Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates in Dallas, said RCN’s new service could speed the rollout of competing offerings from Boston’s other broadband providers, Comcast Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. “Where we see it emerging in markets we’ll often see competitors follow, because that’s a portion of their business they can’t afford to give up,” said Sappington. “The profit margins are so high.” Verizon Communications offers speeds as high as 750 megabits for $150 per month. The largest provider, Comcast, offers a 2-gigabit service called Gigabit Pro. But it’s only available to single-family homes, not apartments. The standard price for the service is $299.99 a month, though Comcast currently offers a promotional price of $149.99 for 24 months. In addition, installation of Gigabit Pro costs $500, because it requires a dedicated fiber optic line. Comcast is currently upgrading its nationwide cable network to support one-gigabit service without the need to run dedicated fiber. This upgrade is due for completion in 2018, but the company hasn’t provided a date for finishing the work in Boston. Hiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com.

Doing so would open a Google Wallet window that lets you enter the amount of money you’ll send to the third party. Once you’ve confirmed the amount, you’ll be given the option to add a memo for the payment. Once you’ve tap on the “Done” button, the payment will be attached to your email, after which you can send it out to the third party. In the event that you’re the recipient of the payment, all you need to do is open the attachment and tap on the “Claim Money” button. Recipients can choose to either have the money transferred into their Google Wallet balance, or have it transferred directly into their bank account. Perhaps the best part of this feature is that the recipient doesn’t need to have a Gmail account in order to receive payment via this feature.

Going by Google’s dessert-based nomenclature for its OS updates, the next Android update is expected to be called Android Oreo. The company’s senior vice-president for Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer teased the update on Twitter in February. Read: Android O Name Teased As Oreo Attendees gather at the Android developer sandbox during the Google I/O Conference at Moscone Center in San Francisco,June 28, 2012. Photo: REUTERS/Stephen Lam The next update is expected to bring new features, 9to5Google reported on Saturday. According to the report, Android 8.0 is expected to be a major update bringing new notifications, picture-in-picture mode and more. Since the company’s Android Nougat Developer Preview released in March last year, it is expected to come out with the Android 8.0 Developer Preview soon. Here are some of the expected features of Android 8.0, according to the report. Notification changes Google could change the design of notifications in the upcoming update. The design could actually emerge out of a merger of the Google Project Andromeda and Android OS and the improvements prepared for the shelved project will now be included in Android 8.0. These include: Notifications across devices Notification presented according to your preferences and usage, using machine-learning processes Determination of notifications according to location, time and device used. Icon badges for apps In the new update, activation notifications will now have badges to mark them out from other notifications. Picture-in-picture mode Post Android 8.0, Android-based smartphones will have a picture-in-picture mode, just like Android T.V Floating Toolbar for smart text The new update is expected to make the Google Bar more useful, by introducing a floating toolbar powered by Google Assistant. This along with a Copy Less feature, which automatically sources out relevant information from Google and lets you add it to your conversations will make the search bar much more useful. Read: Android O: 5 Expected Features Restricted background activities for apps This feature will let users save battery and data by cutting off background activities for inactive apps. For example, if you have many tabs opened in Chrome, this feature will make the app inactive to save background data and battery. Related Stories Android 8.0 Named Oreo?

PHOTO: Jani Brumat Google is continuing to make online images both beautiful and functional with a new algorithm that reduces file sizes 35 percent than now available methods. It described the latest innovation Guetzli, an open source algorithm, as an advancement in its efforts in getting webpages to load faster while using less data. Google has worked on this for a long time. In the past, it offered Zopfli and Brotlie, and then, in November, RAISR —Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution — which uses machine learning to produce high-quality versions of low-resolution images. Now Guetzli gives webmasters another way do more with less, according to a blog post by Robert Obryk and Jyrki Alakuijala, software engineers at Google Research Europe. “Guetzli — or cookie in Swiss German — is a JPEG encoder for digital images and web graphics that can enable faster online experiences by producing smaller JPEG files while still maintaining compatibility with existing browsers, image processing applications and the JPEG standard,” the post explains. This is a lot like the Zopfli algorithm, which produces smaller PNG and other files without needing to introduce a new format. But it differs from the techniques used in RNN-based image compression, RAISR and WebP, which all need client and ecosystem change for compression gains at internet scale. Guetzli estimates the psychovisual similarity of two images with a model called Butteraugli, which decides what colors and details to keep, and which to throw away, in the same way, human eyes process images. Google is encouraging others to work with the open source option to advance image and video compression research.

Managing director of Pure SEO Richard Conway says the introduction of the Google Shopping platform to the New Zealand market will allow users to search for products on online shopping websites and compare prices between different retailers - ultimately making it easier to save money. "Kiwis using Google may have already started to find a ‘carousel’ of images of products and their prices at the top of the search results. "What used to be a manual process of opening each site and checking for the correct product and lowest price will now take a fraction of the time," says Conway. "Most consumers don't search past the first page of search engine results but this ‘prime real estate’ is often dominated by those businesses with the largest marketing budgets - not necessarily the lowest prices," he says. Conway says recent research into New Zealand shopping habits found that more than half (53%) of shoppers compared products and pricing online before purchasing. The research also found search engine results were the most popular online source of pre-purchase information with almost four in ten (39%) consumers using them. He says in addition to businesses targeting the domestic market, many New Zealand exporters will also benefit from the introduction of Google Shopping as it makes it more cost effective to reach global markets. "What this will mean for Kiwi businesses is a levelling of the playing field against dominant larger competitors. "As the cost to reach each consumer comes down, those Kiwi businesses which sell direct to consumers will find it easier to compete with the marketing spend of larger players," he says. Conway cites the example of one business which was able to reduce their marketing spend with Google by 45 percent in a recent trial of the Shopping platform. "New Zealand businesses spend tens of millions each year advertising online and this is expected to reach $900million by 2020. "The introduction of new technology like Google Shopping will help improve the online shopping experience for Kiwi consumers and we expect it to open up new markets for Kiwi retailers almost overnight." Conway says that Google Shopping will not replace the traditional text adverts and will help anyone with an ecommerce presence in their ability to compete including bricks and mortar with a smaller ecommerce presence. "Research has found that this new advertising service actually complements traditional AdWords, as when a consumer is faced with both Shopping and text ads, more than 90 percent visit the website and 83 percent make a purchase. "Because of this, we expect to see to see businesses incorporating the new technology rather than replacing an existing one," he says.

Watch thousands of movies, TV series, documentaries and more with Netflix. Clash Royale – With millions of players worldwide on both Android and iOS, Clash Royale is one of the most popular (and addicting) games available. I used to be a die-hard Clash of Clans player, but Royale has taken over its spot. Instagram – It’s popular for many reasons, but I love the ease of use and all the filters to bring my photos to life with Instagram. Samsung Pay – If you haven’t tried it I’d strongly recommend using Samsung Pay if you have a Galaxy smartphone. Easy mobile payments at almost 95% of stores throughout the US. It’s far better than Apple Pay, or Android Pay and is backwards compatible with old terminals too. It works everywhere. Google Maps – If you need directions, navigation instructions, or are looking for a nearby place nothing beats Google Maps. Bank of America – Everyone has a different app for their bank, but I keep my banking app front and center so I can check funds, transfer payments and more with ease. Venmo is a good app too, for easily sending and receiving money from friends and family. Textra SMS – The amount of 3rd party text messaging apps for Android is getting out of hand. However, Textra is one of the best I’ve found, uses material design, has plenty of customization, and is the cleanest, sleekest, and fastest app I’ve used to date. Device Manager – If you ever lose your phone, whether that be at home in the couch or while you’re out and about, you’ll want to have Device Manager installed. It’s like Find my iPhone. You can lock it, make it ring, or wipe all data to prevent info getting in the wrong hands from theft. SoundHound – Music discovery and lyrics is easier than ever before thanks to SoundHound. I have a one-click widget to instantly find more info about a song that I use all the time. And my daughter loves the live lyrics. Slack – If you work on a team or in a small office forget the hassles of email for internal communication and switch to Slack. You’ll love it. MyFitnessPal – MyFitnessPal is one of the best weight loss apps around with hundreds of thousands of happy users. Get in shape for the summer months by using it. LastPass – Use a super difficult to guess and long password, and let LastPass remember the rest for anything and everything you do. Only one password for everything. It even has fingerprint sign-in. Read our LastPass review. WatchESPN – We mention this again below, but it’s bar far one of the best Android apps and something I use all year long. WatchESPN always has a spot on my home screen. Falcon Pro – Falcon Pro is easily my favorite Twitter client for Android, but it can’t be used by most thanks to a dumb token limit set by Twitter. Try the new Falcon Pro 3, or Robird which are both excellent. Many enjoy Talon, too. Best Entertainment Apps Everyone is different when it comes to what they use for entertainment, and many just stick to YouTube. However, these are some of the best apps to keep you entertained. Sling TV – Just $20 a month for live TV streamed right over the internet, including sports and NFL Network. Add bundles to get more channels (only the good ones) and ditch cable. I use this daily. Hulu Plus – This is my go to app for watching TV shows on Android. Although it offers a wide range of shows I mostly watch the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on it. HBO Go – When I want to watch Game of Thrones or old Entourage episodes on the go I use the HBO Go app. It’s also great for access to comedy specials that are easy to watch in small blocks while on the go. Stream it to the bigscreen with Google Chromecast. Netflix – Netflix, it has almost everything. Need I say more? How about that House of Cards? WatchESPN – When I need to catch an NCAA Football game or enjoy some sports, news, highlights and more, I sign into WatchESPN through Cox and enjoy everything it has to offer. ESPN Radio – When I can’t watch I’ll use the ESPN Radio app to listen to games and other programs. Perfect for listening to sports while driving or hitting the gym. Showtime Anytime – The Showtime app isn’t the best, but works great on smartphones or tablets, and even the Amazon Fire TV or Stick. iFunny – If you want the latest funny photos, trending jokes, memes, GIF’s and more iFunny is like Reddit and full of humor. Same goes for The Chive app. NFL Mobile – I no longer have Verizon so NFL Mobile is somewhat limited, but it’s the #1 way to watch NFL Football on Android. By far. DirecTV – I can watch live TV on Android using my DirecTV subscription. I don’t get all of my channels, but there are enough great options. It works good on tablets too, or use the Cox Contour app. Xbox One SmartGlass – With this app I can connect to my Xbox to change the game I am playing, enter in text and see and respond to messages without leaving a game. Yahoo Fantasy  – You can use this app to track almost any thing you need to stay on top of your fantasy sports team. Bleacher Report is also an awesome app for up to the second news on Sports. Amazon Prime Video – Last but not least, Amazon Prime members can use this to watch free streaming video on Android devices including movies and TV shows without an additional subscription. Best Android Games Our lists above went over some of the best games for Android by category. However, if I had to choose a few of them for one big list, these would be them. At least for me. Clash of Clans – With millions of players worldwide on both Android and iOS, Clash of Clans is one of the most popular (and addicting) games available on mobile, and I play it way more than I should. So much my girlfriend rolls her eyes each time she hears the launch intro song. RipTide GP2 – This water racing game shows excellent graphics, keeps me entertained for hours, and shows just how good gaming can be on Android. Asphalt 8 – Asphalt 8: Airborne is the eighth release in a series of the best racing games for Android, period. Flockers – Flockers is like old school Lemmings, but for the 21st century. It’s fun, addicting, and very challenging. NFL Kicker – For some reason NFL Kicker is always one of my favorite games while on a flight, or needing a casual game to enjoy. I play it for hours, and pass it off to friends to try (and fail) to beat my high score. Trivia Crack – If you want to battle your friends in some good old fashion Trivia, this award winning game is one of my all time favorites. It keeps getting better and better, and integration with iOS and Facebook friends makes it a must. Like Words With Friends, you can play it for hours, or weeks, or months. Same goes for SongPop. Subway Surfers – Those looking for a casual and fun game similar to Temple Run, try Subway Surfers. It’s free. Alto’s Adventure – Jump and ski your way to the bottom of a never-ending mountain as you collect llamas, run from village elders and collect power ups. Agar.io – Control growing circle that expands as it absorbs smaller circles until you are the biggest blob on the board. Simple, but addicting. This game won tons of awards. Fallout Shelter – Manage resources and grow your shelter in this Fallout game that is a perfect fit for Android phones. Fun and frustrating at the same time as you balance inhabitants and resources. Minecraft: Pocket Edition – It really needs no introduction. Minecraft Pocket edition brings the world of building and exploration to mobile devices. There are some mods too, and it works great on any and all Android devices. Pokemon GO – Yes, it has to be on this list. For a while there in 2016 Pokemon GO literally took over the world, parks, business and more. It’s still fun and gets lots of updates. Catch Em All! Or, download some emulators and enjoy old school classics on Android. Many of them work great with a bluetooth game controller. Best Shopping Apps I do most my shopping online these days, and you’ll probably want at least a few of the apps below to get all your shopping done with ease. Amazon –  Amazon has one of the biggest and best selections around, not to mention 2-day free shipping with Amazon Prime can’t be beat. It’s my go to app. I wonder how much money I’ve spent at Amazon. That should be listed somewhere. eBay – I don’t use eBay as much as I did five years ago, but it still has plenty of stuff you otherwise can’t find elsewhere. I still browse occasionally, and use PayPal for my purchases. But seller fees keep me from selling anything. CPro for Craigslist – Craigslist is one of my favorite sites for shopping, but use caution and watch out for scams. I always meet buyers or sellers at a gas station or retail store. Better safe than sorry. Best Buy  – The Best Buy app show current specials, gaming information and rewards for My Best Buy. PayPal – I use the PayPal app to check on balances for purchases I make online, and to check incoming payments for various projects. This is also a place to see receipts for PayPal debit card purchases. A similar app for sending money is called Venmo, and many love it. Meh Notifier – Meh.com is one of my favorite sites. Like Woot.com back in the day, Meh.com has one sale a day that’s usually pretty good. And don’t forget about Two for Tuesdays. I’ve bought over 20 things from this darn site in the last 8 months. The app is decent, but I’d just go to the site as it has an excellent mobile layout. Gas Buddy – Find the cheapest gas near you and get an alert when gas prices are set to go up so that you can fill up before the price changes. Starbucks – With the mobile ordering option skip lines and get that overpriced coffee even faster. They do have some good drinks, and a nice points system for free drinks. OpenTable – This is the fastest way to get a reservation at a restaurant. Forget calling and checking multiple times over the phone and checking with your group. See what is open and then book it without making a call. Flixster – This could be in entertainment, but I use it to browse and buy my movie tickets. Flixster has an awesome design, movie previews, reviews and rating, and lets you buy tickets right in the app. Including Fandango ones. Best Social Apps These days social apps and social networks run the internet, and you’ll want to have some of the best apps available to keep in touch with friends, family, or all those funny GIF’s or memes floating around. Twitter – The stock Twitter app is fine for most, but I prefer Falcon Pro, or Talon is a good choice too. Facebook – We can’t forget about Facebook to keep in touch with friends or family, or to see every ridiculous post that one friend makes on an hourly basis. Facebook Messenger – Facebook’s Messenger app keeps getting better and better. From messages, calling, emoji’s, voice messages and more. Keep in touch with this SMS replacement app. It also is taking on Snapchat and Instagram lately, so give it another try. Instagram – Again, Instagram has one of the best list of features to fine tune photos, add filters, and create “art” from photos, or at least that’s what I’m told. Also try Prisma, it isn’t a social site, but has beautiful filters better than the IG. Snapchat – If you’ve never used it, Snapchat allow for fast and easy communication with friends. Add a caption and hit send, and the image deletes itself for security reasons. Use it as you see fit. Untappd – This is a social network for beer lovers that can help you find new beers to try and enjoy. I’ve recently started brewing my own. TapaTalk – If you’re on a forum for a passion, interest, hobby, or like talking about your truck with other truck enthusiast, Tapatalk is one of the best forum apps. Signal – Apple users have iMessage, and those on Android who want to send messages privately and secure, should use this app. It’s one of the best around. Or you could attempt to get friends on Google Allo. Android Apps You’ll Love We’ve already gone over some of the most important and best apps, but here are a few more you’ll find useful and end up loving. Dropbox – Although Google Drive is useful, Dropbox is the could storage service I use most. This is how I move files, photos, ringtones and screenshots between devices. And I have a huge collection of GIF’s and funny photos making fun of the Bears or Patriots. ES File Explorer – File explorers are extremely useful to manage and find important things or documents. I recently started using Astro, but there are plenty of good options. Yelp – Everyone knows about Yelp, but there are millions that don’t take advantage of this tool to find stores, places to eat, and more in your neighborhood or city. Groupon – Everyone likes saving money, finding good deals, or doing fun things you never knew were available in your town. I’ve gone bowling, horseback riding, done Archery and more all at huge discounts thanks to Groupon. One day I’ll use a coupon for a week getaway vacation to Italy. Google Opinion Rewards – Speaking of money, want to earn up to $100 a year just by answering a quick survey every few days. It usually takes about 5-10 seconds, and you’re all done. Enable location, answer questions and get paid. I’ve earned over $150 with Google Opinion Rewards. You can too. I spend it on Clash Royale, movies and music. Best Android Travel Apps StubHub – Finding tickets for an upcoming Packers game or the next Nick Swardson comedy special is easy and safe with StubHub. It’s the most trusted place to get tickets and no get scammed. Flightaware – Always know where a flight is. This is the best way to track the flights that your loved ones or business associates are on. TripIt – The best all in one travel organizer that tracks your hotel, flight, car rental and other activities simply by connecting your email to the app or forwarding a reservation. Or the best way to book all of that is Trivago. Grub Hub – An essential tool for ordering delivery from restaurants without making a phone call. Available in 800 cities and includes 30,000 restaurants. Hotel Tonight – Find last-minute reservations at great hotels for a bargain. You can book up to seven days out, then save money to enjoy your vacation. TripAdvisor – Find, book, read reviews and more for anything that has to do with a trip. I use TripAdviser anytime I go out of town, and rely on it for activities and helpful information. Waze – While I normally rely on Google Maps, Waze helps deal with traffic. Google recently bought them, but I still use it occasionally. That or Google Now. I also use Waze or Speed Trap to tell me where the cops are. Glympse – This tool can help you tell people when you will get to a location. Just share a Glympse with them and they can see your current location and estimated time of arrival. Best Business Apps for Android Keeping up with business related things on our Android smartphones or tablets is now easier than ever. We’re in an “apps world” and there’s an app that will make everything easier. Check these out. UPS – With UPS My Choice and this app I can see when packages will come and even change delivery options if I need to. Fedex – With this app and registration with FedEx I can see all FedEx packages coming to my house from Ground and Express in one place. Even when I don’t have a tracking number. ParcelTrack – If you get a lot of packages or delivers from multiple shipping companies, you’ll absolutely love ParcelTrack. It tells me where everything is, when it’s coming, delays and more. Tiny Scanner – Use this quickly scan in a document without a scanner. The results are amazing and you would swear that it came from a full size scanner in an office. Speedtest – Whenever you need to check your business WiFi or 4G LTE signal, or just make sure you have good internet before uploading a file, use this. It checks the speed and performance of the internet you’re using. Facebook Pages – I use this app to manage several Facebook pages. There is no real alternative, but it is still one of my must have apps. WordPress – If you work in WordPress this app can be a lifesaver when mobile. For whatever reason it lags at times and can drain the battery, but it’s great when you need it. Expensify – An easy to use expensing app that captures receipts and cash transactions easily. You don’t need to enter in dollar amounts, it scans the images for you. Then submit a expense report to your boss or any email address in minutes. Quickbooks – When you need to look over or find important information on your books, this account manage is the tool for you. Parkmobile – No change, no problem. Use ParkMobile to find and pay for parking at some of the most popular areas in the United States. Sheets – Working while on the go, doing spreadsheets or dealing with important information? Sheets is my go-to web app for business. Google Docs – Just like sheets, those dealing with a lot of documents absolutely need to take advantage of Google Docs. I use this a few times a month for work, and you’ll love it. Dropbox – Still the most accessible and easy to use cloud storage client I’ve found. This is an easy way to get to my files and to upload files for access from anywhere. Random or Unique Android Apps In closing, we wanted to highlight a few more random or unique apps that many should use. Some are apps that a lot of people don’t know about, or just didn’t fit anywhere else in our list. Snapdragon Battery Guru – This free app analyzes your smartphone to deliver better battery life. It only works on devices powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, which most high-end phones are. iMDb – Movie trailers, news, information and more. I love this app because I’m a movie buff. Android Wear – For those using Android Wear smartwatches HD Widgets – HD Widgets gives you those pretty clock and weather widgets, and tons of quick toggles like tethering, bluetooth, and more for easy access. Zedge – Zedge has the biggest collection of wallpapers, backgrounds, ringtones, text alerts and more. I have the Mario Bros Coin sound for my SMS thanks to Zedge. RunPee – If you’re in a movie and don’t want to miss an important scene or some action, use Runpee to know when it’s safe in a movie to take a quick break. You’re welcome. Push Bullet – Have you ever wanted to send and receive your text messages on a computer or PC. Push Bullet does that and much more. Transfer files, manage images or send messages through your phone on a PC. Smart Tools – Have you ever needed a ruler, compass, flashlight or even a bubble level while doing things? If so, Smart Tools is for you. I use it to hang photos on the wall, measure things in a pinch and more. As more and more apps are released that enable our smartphones to do incredible things, this list will be updated. We hope these great apps help you do more on your Android. 2 Responses 03/20/2017 Suraj Padmasali Reply Awesome list of apps! But I think you forget to add Spotify app. By using this app, you get a better experience than Google play music. It’s one of the best-made apps in my opinion. 03/22/2017 Cory Gunther Reply Yeah it certainly needs to be in the list. It’s in our best music apps roundup listed in the post, but I must have missed that for the entertainment or my daily apps section. I use it and Google Music both, daily. Thanks!

(Reuters/Siphiwe Sibeko) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains March 20, 2017 Modern artificial intelligence is built to mimic nature—the field’s main pursuit is replicating in a computer the same decision-making prowess that humankind creates biologically. For the better part of three decades, most of AI’s brain-inspired development has surrounded “neural networks,” a term borrowed from neurobiology that describes machine thought as the movement of data through interconnected mathematical functions called neurons. But nature has other good ideas, too: Computer scientists are now revisiting an older field of study that suggests putting AI through evolutionary processes, like those that molded the human brain over millennia, could help us develop smarter, more efficient algorithms. But first, back to middle-school biology class. The concept of evolution, famously credited to Charles Darwin and refined by countless scientists since, states that slight, random changes in an organism’s genetic makeup will give it either an advantage or disadvantage in the wild. If the organism’s mutation allows it to survive and reproduce, that mutation is then passed along. If it doesn’t, the mutation dies with its organism. In algorithm world, this is known as neuroevolution. While artificial neural networks replicate the process of learning individual concepts, neuroevolution tries to recreate the process that built parts of the brain—i.e. the process by which only the strong (or smart) survive. Although neuroevolution has been around since the 1980s, the concept is getting renewed attention as researchers dig into the archives for different perspectives on machine learning. In the past month, Google Brain and non-profit organization OpenAI each published unreviewed papers on the subject, Google’s on the application of neuroevolution principles to image recognition and OpenAI’s on using “worker” algorithms to teach a master algorithm the best way to accomplish a task. 🤖 Bringing biological evolution into the already complex field of AI research can be confusing. So if it’s easier, think of algorithms as horses. Horses learn throughout their lifetime, but they are only evaluated on a few different metrics, like how fast they run. Accuracy in image recognition is easy to assess as a single number, as is the amount of time it takes a horse to run around a track. But what actually makes that horse run faster is incredibly complicated—a vast network of DNA that enables muscle growth, higher stamina, and even intellect. That complexity mirrors the underlying parameters of algorithms, or how an algorithm might be good (or bad) at image recognition. So if you get lost anywhere in the article, just take a deep breath and think “horses.” (This is also good life advice.) For its research, the Google team generated 1,000 image-recognition algorithms that were trained using modern deep neural networks to recognize a specific set of images. Then 250 computers each chose two algorithms and tested their accuracy by making them identify an image. The algorithm with higher accuracy lived, while the one that performed poorly was “killed.” The survivor was then copied, and its clone (or “child”) was changed slightly—just like human DNA randomly changes during reproduction. But instead of blue eyes or a widow’s peak, this mutation slightly altered how the new algorithm interprets training data. The clone was then trained using the same data as its parent, and put back into the batch of 1,000 algorithms to start the process over again. Google researchers found that neuroevolution could cultivate an algorithm with 94.6% accuracy, and recorded similar (though not identical) results during each of four repeats of the experiment. Mutations that improved the algorithm’s image-recognition skills were rewarded (i.e. those algorithms survived) while mutations that decreased performance were killed off. Just like in nature. The differences between the five sessions also illustrated a consistent problem. Google researcher and paper co-author Esteban Real says the algorithms kept getting stuck halfway through the process, seemingly unsure whether to continue evolving or scrap the mutation and start over. Real says an analogy in nature might be the evolution of wings. “Half a wing might not help you very much,” he says, “but a full wing lets you fly.” Google’s team is now working on getting the evolutionary models to explore different mutations more fully (to build whole wings). But that gets tricky. The team only wants the algorithm to mutate in a limited way, so it doesn’t end up with a whole bunch of extra code that isn’t useful. Explains Real: “The worst would be having many half-wings.” 🤖 By focusing mainly on image recognition, Google tested both neuroevolution’s capacity for tackling something the biological brain is great at, and its ability to solve a modern problem. OpenAI, on the other hand, used a more pure form of evolution to undertake a different task. Rather than training thousands of algorithms to get better at one thing, the OpenAI team wanted to use “worker” algorithms to train a master algorithm to accomplish an unknown task, like playing a videogame or walking in a 3D simulator. This technique isn’t the primary way to teach machines how to make decisions, but a way to teach them how to learn from specific information more efficiently, explains co-author and OpenAI researcher Tim Salimans. The evolutionary algorithm is able to monitor how its workers are learning, and it essentially learns to learn—that is, to extract more knowledge from the same amount of data. To conduct their research, the OpenAI team set 1,440 worker algorithms to the task of playing Atari. The workers played until they reached Game Over, at which point they reported their scores to the master. The algorithms that garnered the best scores were copied, as in the Google research, and the copies were randomly mutated. The mutated workers then went back into rotation and the process repeated itself, with advantageous mutations being rewarded and bad ones killed. This approach also has its limitations, chief among them that the worker algorithms only report one number, their high score, back to the master algorithm. The algorithms with the best scores survived, but trying to make the master aware of any specifically successful moves would require far too much computing power. (In biology, the parallel might be an ant colony: Workers go out and find the most optimal solutions; the queen is the central hub of information.) In other words, OpenAI learned a lot about success, but less about scrappiness. 🤖 Back in the 1980s, neuroevolution and neural networks were similarly sized fields of study, says Kenneth Stanley, an associate professor at the University of Central California and a recent addition to Uber’s AI team (through their acquisition of Geometric Intelligence, which he co-founded). “There was a small community of people who thought about how brains, which are really the only proof of concept of intelligence in nature, get into the world,” Stanley says. “Some people thought maybe the most straightforward way to do this would be to create a evolutionary, Darwinian-like process in a computer that acts on little artificial brains.” Neural networks took off when three computer scientists—David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams—published a 1986 paper describing an algorithm that enhanced the way those networks learned from their mistakes, called backpropagation. The findings greatly improved the efficacy of hand-built neural nets, but an impending AI winter—funding was slashed for purported lack of progress—impeded further growth. It wasn’t until the mid-aughts that Hinton and company began publishing papers that made neural networks too enticing for the larger computer science community to resist, showing that backpropagation allows neural networks to grow immensely, and to in turn understand far more complex ideas. These networks were dubbed “deep,” and deep neural networks became the most popular flavor of modern artificial intelligence. “Because of that, there was some loss of awareness for neuroevolution, which was this parallel thread of evolving brains,” says Stanley. Back in 2002, at the start of his career, Stanley wrote an algorithm called NEAT, which allowed neural networks to evolve into larger and more complex versions over time. His corresponding paper has more than 1,600 citations on Google Scholar, and has been referenced in deep neural-network design and neuroevolution research since its publication. In 2006, Stanley published Hyper-NEAT, an algorithm that made neuroevolution much greater in scale, inspired by DNA’s ability to be the blueprint for billions of biological neurons with trillions of connections, despite only having around 30,000 genes. (Fun fact: Hyper-NEAT’s full name is Hybercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies. I challenge anyone to name a better algorithm anagram.) Today, Stanley says it’s gratifying to see his career’s work back in the zeitgeist. Like Stanley, OpenAI and Google are now tackling two different ideas plucked from the same field. Google’s hybrid approach combines classic neuroevolution with the techniques, like backpropagation, that have made deep learning so powerful today: Teach an algorithm how to act in the world, let it evolve, and that algorithm’s child will have most of the accrued knowledge. OpenAI’s approach was more true to how evolution works in biology. The team only let the randomized mutations in every generation govern how the networks improved or failed, meaning improvement was only created through random evolution. But both attempts had very clear goals—recognize an image, or get a high score in a game (or make a horse run faster). How the algorithms got there was up to nature. “Individuals are born with the weights in their brain that they’re going to have for their entire life,” Stanley says about OpenAI’s work. “It’s like if we bred you, and your children, and your children’s children, and then they knew calculus.” Most Popular Being vegan isn’t as good for humanity as you think Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

It recently made headlines when the internet realised every time someone speaks to Google, it records their voice. And you can listen back to it. But that isn't the only bit of Google data that users with the right know-how can track down. ADVERTISEMENT One of the more interesting places to check out what Google really knows about you is to head over to its ad settings page where (if you're signed into your Google account) you'll see a profile Google has built for you based on your search history, YouTube history and interests. So, for example, it might know that you're female, aged 18-24 and interested in banking, consumer electronics, mobile phones, shooter games, rap and hip hop and toys. Google doesn't make a huge song and dance about its in-depth knowledge of its users, but at the same time it doesn't keep it a secret either. Here's how to find out what Google knows and take control of your data.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google’s New Algorithm can Compress JPEG without Compromising on Quality March 20, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Apple Social Video App Comes Minus Social Networking VAIO Makes Android Foray with New Phone A JPEG compression is a thing of high priority in the modern day web world. But despite the availability of multiple tools, JPEG compression have always created headache due to its ubiquity. One wouldn’t definitely want to have pixelated images loaded, and neither would they want to wait too much for an image to get loaded while browsing. Hopefully, Google says that it has found the right solution for this conundrum. Called Guetzli, the new JPEG encoder from Google is capable of compressing the JPEG sizes by 35% without creating any distortion to the original picture. Or in other words, Guetzli will be able to create better quality images at original sizes of the JPEG. Guetzli focuses on quantization which transforms disordered data those are hard to compress into ordered data that are comparatively easier to compress. The difficult part was retaining the sizes, and that was managed by Google by introducing a new psycho-visual model, which they call the Butteraugli. The psychovisual model is similar to human visual processing system, and the exact working is a bit complex and deals with detailed color perception and visual masking. In short, this helps Guetzli to distinguish the colors and details to be kept and discarded. By doing so, the algorithm will be able to keep small details that are else wise obliterated as single blocks of color. Google’s new algorithm will be mostly beneficial in reducing the sizes of images in web pages, though it can also be used to tweak those captured using your devices. The algorithm is open-sourced and is available for download to all. Simultaneously, the technology can also be used to improve the quality of JPEGs while keeping the file size unaltered.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Assistant Won’t Embrace Tablets Despite Wider Rollout March 20, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Apple Social Video App Comes Minus Social Networking Microsoft wants to Make Your Switch from Macs to Surface Easier with its New Tool Google Assistant has started its journey on non-Pixel devices. We are sure many of the Android users are checking for its arrival by doing a tap-and-hold with their home buttons. Google has revealed that its personal assistant will arrive on devices running Nougat as well as Marshmallow. However, that doesn’t entirely reveal the picture. According to the latest report, a segment of the so-called eligible OS-running devices will still be missing out the Google Assistant entry. Unfortunately, it’s not a small segment as the mentioned class is the tablets. Earlier revelation has raised concern over whether Google Assistant will arrive on Android-powered tablets. Putting an end to all those queries, Google has now come up with the official announcement that its Assistant won’t be showing up in tablets anytime soon. At least, tablet owners can now stop hitting and holding their home buttons now. But that said, it’s not that Google is completely omitting the tablet segment. It could arrive for the bigger devices at some point later. But you should definitely stop anticipating for that point to be sooner. Google has refused to comment on whether they have a schedule for the tablet debut of Google Assistant. Users can still go the hard way of bringing up the Google Assistant if having eligible OS running in their tablets. However, those desiring an official entry would have to test their patience. This should also heat up the Android faithful who have been feeling an unfair treatment of tablets by Google including its own apps.

Follow Lynsey Related City Talk Scottish Development International Talk Can you get your teeth into the UK's £322 billion data sector? Google is facing pressure from brands to take action (Source: Getty) Lynsey Barber Google is facing growing pressure over claims it's profiting from hate speech as some of Britain's biggest banks are the latest to pull their ads from YouTube. Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Lloyds have suspended their advertising with the tech giant following an investigation which revealed household brand names were appearing next to offensive and extremist content on the video site. Meanwhile, Marks & Spencer is reportedly preparing to pull its advertising with the tech firm for the same reason. A spokesperson for RBS said: "We are not aware of any issue with our ads to date, but we take this issue extremely seriously and are suspending all advertising until they fix this." Other high-profile brands Vodafone, Sky and Barclays are also considering whether or not to withdraw ads, according to the Sunday Times. A Sky spokesperson said: “It is clearly unacceptable for ads to be appearing alongside inappropriate content and we are talking with Google to understand what they are doing to stop this happening.” Read more: Google, Facebook and Twitter won't tell MPs how many staff moderate content It follows the extraordinary steps taken by french advertising group Havas on Friday, which pulled advertising of all its UK clients on YouTube and Google Display Network.The media agency sells ads on behalf of O2, Royal Mail, the BBC and Dominos among others. To be clear, @Havas_MGUK has 'paused' only YT & GDN activity & is working closely with Google to find a solution before un-pausing ad spend.— Paul Frampton Calero (@Paul_Framp) March 17, 2017 WPP, the world's biggest advertising group, fell short of pulling its clients' ads. But, chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell warned they "cannot masquerade as technology companies" and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. A spokesperson for WPP media agency GroupM, said: "Digital advertising on platforms where content is user-generated and not curated has inherent brand safety risks. GroupM vigorously pursues every brand safety precaution and technology available to mitigate these risks, and we encourage all clients to make use of these tools. "At the highest levels, we have communicated with Google, Facebook, Snapchat and other partners to encourage their development of solutions. However, a 100 per cent foolproof system may not be possible. It’s important that brands know this and proceed with caution – as well as with available safety tools." Sky rival BT, both of which are the UK's biggest advertisers, said it was confident that its advertising appeared as it should. A spokesperson said: “We take our responsibilities as an advertiser seriously and have a robust set of safeguards in place to make sure our adverts don’t appear on websites or content which may be dedicated to offensive themes.” Earlier, several brands - The Guardian, Channel 4, L'Oreal and government bodies such as Transport for London (TfL) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD- withdrew from advertising through the channel. Google defended its abilities to tackle the problem, saying it invests millions in and employs thousands to stop bad advertising practices, but admitted it doesn't always "get it right". "Just last year, we removed nearly 2 billion bad ads from our systems, removed over 100,000 publishers from our AdSense program, and prevented ads from serving on over 300 million YouTube videos," said Google UK managing director Ronan Harris in a blog post. "In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetisation policies. We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more." However, the tech firm was hauled in front of the Cabinet Office on Friday to explain itself and will be asked to update civil servants on their actions again next week.

She followed this up with a stinging letter to Google's head of public policy Peter Barron accusing the company of profiting from hatred.

By PYMNTS Posted on March 20, 2017 Share Tweet Share Share Share Email March this week improved on its “in like a lion” bonafides with a mid-month blizzard that socked most of the Northeast and gave us all our collective doubts that any lamb-like exits were in our national future. Innovation Project, incidentally, battled back against the blizzard and kept Cambridge warm despite the ice — which we’ll have coverage about all week. Those parts of the nation that froze as the week started ended the week in the grips of insanity — literally, since the 2017 NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament is underway, as is the attendant “March Madness.” We can’t tell you who to put in your bracket (our teams have mostly already been eliminated from the Sweet 16), but should payments and commerce ever get into bracket-based rankings, we could be terribly useful. This week, for example, Amazon, Chase and Google all made big plays that at least indicated bracket-worthiness. How will this change the shape of the game? Alexa’s Big App Integration Americans without an Echo, Dot or one of a third-party device integrated with Alexa got some good news this week. Soon they too will be able to talk to Alexa — so long as they have the Amazon iOS app on their phones — as Amazon announced last week that it will be embedding its virtual digital assistant into the app. The iOS instantiation of Alexa will be able to shop, play music and perform a “host of other useful tasks” according to the company’s website. Using Alexa via a phone is a similar experience to talking to the device-based edition. Users can ask Alexa to “search for paper towels,” “reorder batteries,” “track my last order” or “find bestselling camera,” which the device will then pull up. As for tasks, Alexa can respond to commands like “play some music,” “play the Beatles,” as well as answer basic questions on the weather, traffic or calendar (“When is Memorial Day?” is a suggested sample question). The move follows a big uptick in Alexa’s skill count. As of last month, the AI voice-activated assistant hit the 10,000 skill milestone. Notably, though Alexa can do a lot, consumers have largely been drawn to a small segment of use cases: News, games and trivia, reference, lifestyle and weather skills comprise the majority share. Will Alexa’s in-app integration make a difference? If it is successful, that is almost certainly a yes for Amazon. Alexa is a learning AI, meaning the more users it has, the more it learns and the better it does. By opening up to the set of iOS users, Amazon potentially has access to a lot of data coming its way. But that only happens if Alexa can successfully compete with Siri, the voice-activated AI that already lives on the iPhone and that users are more familiar with using. Siri also has the advantage of being integrated with the software and is more closely tied to Apple’s overall ecosystem. But users do love Alexa — and if it is outstrips Siri for skills despite being less integrated, the fight for that smartphone real estate could start looking pretty fierce. Chase Pay Grabs up MCX’s Payments Tech In an effort to further expand Chase Pay, JPMorgan Chase has inked a deal to acquire MCX’s payments technology. The transaction is expected to close in the next few weeks. MCX, according to a JPMC release, will give MCX merchants a more “seamless” connection to Chase Pay. “When we think about FinTech, we go through a ‘build/buy/partner’ evaluation to decide how we can get to market most efficiently,” said Jennifer Roberts, head of Chase Pay. “MCX has been an important partner, and their technology complements ours, so we’re thrilled to deepen our relationships with the merchant community through the purchase of this technology. This will help us get to market faster.” Chase Pay launched in November 2016 with a few initial merchants. Since then, it has announced upcoming integrations with Walmart, Shell, Best Buy, Phillips 66 and Wakefern. In December, Chase also announced an investment in LevelUp to bring the ability to order and pay ahead to customers at thousands of quick-service restaurants. The firm also announced an integration with mobile-first movie ticketing platform Atom Tickets. “Consistent with our mission to provide secure, consumer-friendly and cost-effective mobile payment solutions to the marketplace, MCX took advantage of this opportunity to have the solution expanded to the broader merchant community,” said Brian Mooney, CEO of MCX. Payments Come to Gmail In one of the quieter moves of the week, Google announced that the Gmail app on Android will now enable people to send and request money from anyone, even if they do not have a Gmail address. “Whether you’re splitting a dinner bill or planning a group trip, you now have a fee-free way to work out the details and settle up without ever leaving the Gmail app on Android, just like you can already do on the web,” Sam Kansara, a product manager at Google, said in a blog post. The new capability essentially allows a user to send money in the same way they would send an attachment in an email message. Once funds have been received by the recipient, that person can claim the money and have it transferred directly to a selected bank account without having to add or install any additional apps. “We believe that experiences like this should be contextual. Users shouldn’t have to switch apps to complete an interaction where they just need to send or receive money,” a Google spokesperson told PYMNTS. “This integration makes it easier for users to be able to do things in a medium where they’re already communicating with others, so it’s logical to move the payment interaction there too.” Currently the feature is only available in the U.S. and on the web or Android and comes into a very crowded market — Venmo, Square Cash, Facebook Messenger and Zelle are the immediate shortlist that spring to mind. But Google feels that Gmail’s one billion active monthly users might prefer using Gmail better. Feels like a slog. So while we can’t tell you how to build a better bracket, we do have some good overall advice this week. Don’t blink, you might miss something.

X Google braced for questions as more big brands pull adverts M&S, Sky, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS latest to pull ads after they were put beside extremist material Mon, Mar 20, 2017, 07:15 Updated: Mon, Mar 20, 2017, 17:20 Rob Davies Major brands who have pulled their ads include McDonald’s, L’Oreal, Audi and the BBC, while UK government spending has also been suspended. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Wire         Google executives are bracing for a two-pronged inquisition from the advertising industry and UK government over the company’s plans to stop ads being placed next to extremist material. A slew of big-name companies, advertising firms and government departments have either pulled their adverts from Google and its YouTube video site, or are considering whether to do so. UK retailer Marks and Spencer became the latest brand to pull advertising from Google, adding to pressure on the company to step up policing to prevent offensive material, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism, from appearing alongside ads. “In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through,” M&S said in a statement. The retailer acted after the UK government, the Guardian newspaper, grocer J Sainsbury and other marketers pulled advertising from YouTube. French advertising company Havas SA said it was removing certain clients’ spots from the site after it failed to get assurances that they wouldn’t appear alongside offensive videos, while media giant Sky, HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland added their names to a growing list over the weekend. Other major brands to pull their ads include McDonald’s, L’Oreal, Audi and the BBC. Tesco is understood to have “paused” spending on YouTube. The internet firm’s European head, Matt Brittin, is one of two Google executives due to speak at the annual Advertising Week Europe event, attended by every major company in the advertising world. Sources said Mr Brittin is aware he is likely to face a flurry of questions about how adverts for major brands ended up attached to videos by extremists, including hate preachers and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The ads help fund payments to the people who post the videos, with every 1,000 clicks worth about £6 (€6.92). ADVERTISEMENT Explain themselv es Mark Howe, head of Google’s agencies business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will also speak at the event. Mr Brittin will be among the first people to address delegates, speaking on Monday alongside Unilever’s chief marketing officer, Keith Weed. Unilever declined to comment on whether it had suspended advertising through Google. Mr Brittin’s appearance in front of luminaries from the advertising industry will kick off a week in which he and fellow executives will also have to explain themselves to UK government ministers. Senior figures from the company were summoned to the Cabinet Office last week over concerns that UK taxpayer-funded adverts were appearing alongside “inappropriate” YouTube videos. Google executives apologised but were told to come back to the Cabinet Office this week with a plan and a timetable to remedy the problem. Major advertisers have pulled business from the internet search engine in the past week, with Sky, becoming the latest to suspend their ads. – Guardian News and Media, Bloomber       Topics: Google HSBC L'Oréal McDonald's Royal Bank of Scotland Read More Uber hit by new turmoil as president Jeff Jones quits Angry games fans left out in the rain at Dublin’s GamerCon How to . . . save your favourite articles for later Spotify nears licensing deals which may pave way to IPO Parent company of Irish co-founded Hassle.com raises €10m Uber won court battle over drivers’ classification in December A smart Swatch?

Today, Uber's president has left after just six months in the job, Germany has raised its cyberattack alert status, Google has announced that it'll be giving advertisers finer control over where their content appears and more.

Uber president Jeff Jones has stepped down Uber president Jeff Jones is leaving the company after just six months in the position, saying that "the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride sharing business" (Recode). Sources inside the company and a letter from CEO Travis Kalanick say that Jones' departure was influenced by Kalanick's search for a new COO, a position that would outrank Jones and which he was not in consideration for. However, Jones' own statements indicate that he was uncomfortable with the level of conflict at the recently troubled app-based taxi firm.

Germany raises cyberattack alert level ahead of elections Germany's government has reportedly raised its cyberattack alert status to "heightened readiness" as government websites have come under daily assault in the run-up to Germany's federal elections in September (VentureBeat). Speaking to newspaper Welt am Sonntag, Arne Schoenbohm, president of Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security, said "we are noticing attacks against government networks on a daily basis". Schoenbohm explained that threat levels had already been increased following evidence of cyberattacks interfering with the USA's presidential elections last year. 3. Google announces more ad controls after brands boycott service Google has announced that it will roll out tools to give its clients greater control over where their adverts appear on YouTube and the Google Display Network for web-based advertising (TechCrunch). The announcement follows reports that the British government, the Guardian and the UK branch of advertising group Havas suspended advertising on Google's platforms after automatic advert positioning saw ads for the BBC, Domino's Pizza and O2 placed alongside offensive content, including videos by US white supremacist leader David Duke. Google UK managing director Ronan Harris wrote: "I've begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network." 4. Suspect arrested for sending seizure-inducing images over Twitter A man has been arrested for sending a seizure-inducing animated GIF to US journalist Kurt Eichenwald last December (CNET). Eichenwald tweeted: "After a 3 month investigation, the FBI this morning arrested the man who assaulted me using a strobe on twitter that triggered a seizure. He currently faces federal charges & is expected to also be indicted by the Dallas District Attorney on different charges in next few days." The US Department of Justice has confirmed that a 29-year-old man from Maryland was arrested on cyberstalking charges.

Google has made JPEGs smaller Google Research as released a new, open source JPEG encoder, capable of creating compressed image files 35 per cent smaller and with even fewer visible compression artefacts than existing JPEG compression algorithms (Ars Technica). Named Guetzli - Swiss German for cookie - and developed by software engineers at Google's Zurich office, the encoder is available to download now and can be compiled under Linux, Windows and macOS. The developers say that its primary function is to enable its users to "create webpages that can load faster and use even less data".

Europeans evolved to thrive on a plant-based diet Genetic researchers have discovered that humans originating in much of Europe evolved to be better able to process vegetable and grain nutrients as a result of plant-based diets associated with the agrarian lifestyles that developed in Europe and the Middle East (Ars Technica). The FADS (fatty acid desaturase) genes control the body's ability to short-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into long-chain PUFAs that are vital for muscle and brain health. Diets rich in plants and grains contain for short-chain PUFAs, while meat-based diets are already rich in natural sources of long-chain PUFAs. For example, the Inuit people of Greenland's FADS genes produce fewer long-chain PUFAs, as their traditional diet contained a great deal of meat.

The world's first hydrogen-powered passenger train has taken to the tracks in Germany The world's first hydrogen-fuelled passenger-carrying train has undergone its initial test (WIRED). Created by Alstom, the Coradia iLint train completed its test run on a specifically designed test track in Salzgitter, Germany, reaching speeds of 80 km/h. The trial was the first part of a four-week run designed to test the efficiency of the energy supply system and the electric braking system. Alstom says the train will have its passenger tests in Germany in 2018 and could come to the UK as soon as 2021. Unveiled in 2016, the Coradia iLint, Alstom says, is the first low-floor passenger train in the world that's powered by a hydrogen fuel cell which creates its electricity. 8. Super Mario Run is finally coming to Android Nintendo has finally announced that Super Mario Run will be coming to Android on March 23 (Engadget). The automatic runner style platform game, which was first released for iOS devices in December 2016, is the Nintendo mascot's first smartphone outing. Keen mobile gamers can pre-register on the Google Play Store now. It'll be free to download, but only the first four levels will be unlocked unless you buy to unlock the full game. 9. Monopoly has three new playing pieces The thimble, boot and wheelbarrow pieces in Monopoly are being replaced by Tyrannosaurus Rex, a penguin and a rubber duck (WIRED). In 2013, Monopoly’s iconic iron token was usurped by a cat and, last month, Monopoly owner Hasbro announced it was ditching the thimble. It launched the Monopoly Vote website and asked players to vote for which pieces they wanted to see in future versions of the game. More than 4.3 million people from 146 countries voted for the new tokens. 10. Watch Pixar's 80s computer graphics demo reel for industry and government Before Pixar became a household name, its hardware division was keen to market its Image Computer graphics systems for government, industry and scientific use (Gizmodo). This 1988 video showcase, put online in 2013, shows off early incarnations of graphics and data visualisation techniques that we now take for granted, such as surface rendering, and image processing techniques such as dynamic range enhancement. Meanwhile, Pixar's movie division had begun the gradual move from creating special effects for live action films to creating fully 3D animated content, such as 1986's iconic Luxo Jr. short. ADVERTISEMENT Popular on WIRED Why expensive security alarms could actually be putting your valuables at risk On September 30, 2016, after an elaborate police operation, two van Gogh paintings were recovered from the home of a Neapolitan Mafia boss. They had been stolen nearly 14 years earlier from the world-famous Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam on December 7, 2002. The thieves weren't too subtle about their approach: they smashed a window, probably with a sledgehammer wrapped in cloth. The expensive alarm system didn't go off. The guards heard the commotion, but the thieves were too quick for them. They knew exactly which two paintings they wanted, so they walked straight up to them, ripped them off the walls and exited through the broken window. This case is just one of many, and not exclusively in the world of art crime, where expensive security is foiled through the simplest of methods. Most of the time, thieves can render useless a multi-million-pound defence system simply by acting quickly.

The most entertaining examples of parents and grandparents suffering technological fails have been shared on Bored Panda and there's no denying they make for some hilarious viewing. The pictures include a grandmother putting 'please' and 'thank you' at the end of every Google search, a woman sending 'photos' with her thumb covering the lens, and a confused pensioner using an iPad as a chopping board. From writing down the entire website link to using the mouse upside down, the fails are so spectacular it's hard not to want to help. Turn it around! This woman has been spotted talking on the telephone in a cafe but doesn't seem to realise it's the wrong way around - no doubt wondering why she can't hear the caller Does she know what she's doing? A girlfriend's grandmother apparently thought this iPad was a chopping board - or perhaps she just wanted to make sure she got her money's worth When a grandparent couldn't use their TV remote, somebody kindly offered to gran-ify for them, completed with Post-It notes pointing to the on/off and 'undo'  buttons A child was travelling with their mother and spotted her phone. She appears to have been using the screen protector's throwaway film instead of an actual screen protector Why zoom in on a mobile phone when you can use a large magnifying glass instead? This elderly lady has found a resourceful way of reading the typeface on her mobile device Did this elderly person realise something is wrong with their home telephone? It might work better if it was the right way up, but they appear not to have noticed A grandmother asked her grandson to help fix her phone as 'the outside clock is always showing the wrong time' - not realising the 'outside clock' was in fact a screen protector A grandmother showed her son a list of her favourite websites that she had written down on a piece of paper - perhaps not realising the benefits of bookmarks on internet browsers A grandson discovered that every time their grandmother googles something she puts 'please' and 'thank you' - not realising that it is an automated search engine Selfie time! An amused grandchild received this in the post, and thinks it may be in the running for 'slowest picture message ever sent' A grandmother asked her grandchild for help with her computer because 'everything moves backwards' - apparently failing to realise that her mouse was upside down I heart you! One father doesn't know how to turn off the front camera's heart feature on his phone and sent this when he wanted to show his child the new stove An 82-year-old grandmother thought she was plugging in her devices correctly when she committed this fire and safety hazard - luckily a younger relative came to the rescue Despite repeatedly trying, one mother could not work out how to take a picture of the 'beautiful view' without her finger covering the lens - causing her exasperated child to give up Somebody took to Bored Panda to say that their friend's grandmother just asked who this phone belonged to - not realising the chunky device was in fact a calculator A child went home to discover their mother had moved the computer onto a pile of books. When asked why, she apparently replied: 'I thought I would get better Internet' Does every parent text like this? It seems that everybody over the age of 40 insists on holding their phone in one hand and typing out texts with the other, like this woman One grandmother showed off just how high tech she was when she read a book about Kittens in 3-D - dutifully donning a chunky pair of 3-D glasses Is a trip to the optician in order? This short-sighted elderly man needed to zoom in on his screen so that he could see better - but now he can't see much of it at all Always watching! One child opened up their mother's laptop to discover a huge, HD photograph of their grandmother as the desktop background One person wrote: 'Thanksgiving means fixing everyone's computer or phone problems.

Either that, or she hasn't discovered how to get rid of it  A daughter decided to cover all bases and ensure that her mother knew exactly which way was the right side for her iPad - by having it personally engraved with a sweet message Share or comment on this article e-mail 1.1k shares Most watched News videos Shocking moment terror attacker's car speeds across bridge Dramatic video shows horror of aftermath on Westminster Bridge Terrified public flee as three shots ring out in Parliament Square Commotion outside Parliament as police react after attack Injured people lay stricken on Westminster Bridge after attack Horrifying car crash scene shows victim at Parliament railings 'Go! go!'

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Tech & Trend Google Home vs Amazon Echo: Discount on Google's smart assistant makes it a better buy Still puzzled about which smart home assistant to buy? Read on to get rid of your confusion. Sami Khan   March 20, 2017 13:21 IST Google HomeTwitter/@madebygoogle Google Home and Amazon Echo have a neck-and-neck competition in the smart home space. Both smart assistant speakers are making it extremely challenging for buyers to arrive at conclusions. Amazon Echo makes a better choice for its wide range of supported smart home devices while Google Home is a cheaper alternative with growing functionalities. If you are sitting on the fence, the bundle discount on Google Home is likely to give you the much-needed push. The smart assistant, which is available for $129 on Google Play Store in the US, can be bought with $15 discount. To avail this benefit, buyers must pick up two Google Home devices and save a total of $30 by paying $229 instead of $258. Google Home is already priced cheaper than Amazon Echo, which retails at $180. With the latest discount, Google Home has an added advantage. There is no end date for the offer, but Google Store listing says it will be available "while supplies last," which is one way of saying act fast. If pricing is not an issue and you are looking for a good product, we have a brief comparison between both Google Home and Amazon Echo below: Google Home Google has an ocean of knowledge, which is directly integrated with Google Home through Google Assistant. The smart assistant is also a good speaker and connects several smart home devices so that the users can control various features with voice commands. Google Home can answer most of your questions and it is good with follow-up questions. But it certainly comes with limitations. For instance, only one Google account can be linked to the system for now. Amazon Echo As compared to Google Home's knowledge power, Amazon Echo wins with expertise. It has been around since 2014 and the integrated smart assistant Alexa is far more superior in terms of handling third-party devices from known brands like Nest, Philips, SmartThings, Belkin, Wink, Insteon and more,. It has more than 3,000 skill sets and much like Google Home, it can respond to voice commands to play music.

Helena Smith reports: The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has used a meeting with the country’s tourism chief, Andreas Andreadis, to express his conviction that despite being delayed, talks with creditors will be completed soon. “He is very optimistic the review will be concluded,” Andreadis said emerging from the meeting. Labour reforms appears to be the major sticking point, according to insiders who say technical teams are not in a position to resolve what is “an enormously complex” issue. Tsipras in Brussels earlier this month. Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters Although agreement on €3.6bn worth of extra fiscal measures has been reached, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos insists that “nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.” Today’s euro group had originally be set as the deadline for the review to be concluded by Tsipras who told Andreadis that he expected tourism to play an important role in improving GDP this year. It was not impossible, he said, that Greece would attract 30 million tourists in 2017 - an all time record. Government sources are saying they expect the review to be concluded at the next eurogroup on April 7. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.40am EDT 09:40 Wall Street opens lower With the decline in the oil price and uncertainty after the protectionist stance on trade by the US at the weekend’ G20 meeting, Wall Street has made an uncertain start to the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 15 points or 0.07% while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both opened a couple of points lower. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.38am EDT 09:38 The pound’s slip since the confirmation that Brexit will be triggered next week does not mean the currency will remain weak, although there are other risks to watch out for, reckons Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. She said: The pound fell to session lows in the hour after the news, but the question now is, how much further can [it] fall, and is all of the “bad” Brexit news priced in? In fairness, we think that today’s dip in the pound is just a knee-jerk reaction to the Article 50 news, and part of sterling’s decline is also due to the recovery in the dollar and US Treasury yields, 10-year yields are back above 2.5%. But it is worth watching how the pound performs in the next day or two, if [it] can find support ahead of 1.2350 – a key short-term support level- and recoup today’s losses then it would be a bullish signal for the pound for this reason: the pound is failing to react to “bad news”. Last week the pound actually rallied although the Scottish leader said she will hold a second independence referendum, this is significant as markets that don’t fall on what is perceived as bad news can often rally in the aftermath. The other reason to be positive on the pound is the recovery in the UK-US yield spread, which had fallen to a record low at one point last week. This spread has narrowed by 13 basis points since last week’s BOE meeting. This may not sound like a lot, but in the bond market this move is a big deal, and, if it continues to recover, could trigger a further recovery in the pound... This does not mean that the pound is not without risks, it is just that the Brexit negotiations, at least in the short-term, is not one of them. There are a couple of risks for sterling that are worth noting; firstly, retail sales data on Thursday. UK inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% on Tuesday, if rising prices is hurting the consumer, then we could see the pound take a knock. The second risk to sterling is the EU negotiating team’s response to Article 50, which we should know by end of April at the latest. This will be crucial to set the tone for exit negotiations and trade deals with the currency bloc... It is also worth noting that there are risks for other currencies this week too, including the first French Presidential debate tonight, if Far Right candidate Le Pen puts in a strong performance then this could knock the euro. The dollar could also suffer this week from political risk. The US FBI director is scheduled to testify to the US Congress on the extent of Russia’s involvement with the US election; if there is any link that Trump colluded with the Russians to weaken Hillary Clinton’s campaign then his political position will become tenuous and could knock the dollar. This is worth watching later on Monday.

While the timing of the triggering of article 50 comes as no surprise given that May had previously vowed to do so before the end of March, it does show that sterling remains sensitive to Brexit related headlines, even those that are already widely known. While the drop off in the pound isn’t too severe, it was enough to take it into negative territory for the day. It also acts as a reminder that the next two years will likely continue to be volatile for the UK currency as well as the FTSE and UK Gilts, with traders still concerned about the road the country is on.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.56am EDT 07:56 Part of the reason for the strength of the pound is the dollar’s weakness in the wake of the G20 meeting at the weekend which confirmed the US government’s protectionist stance on trade. But there are also growing suggestions of a sooner than expected UK interest rate rise. According to analysts at MNI, the chances of a rate rise later this year have nearly doubled since the Bank of England revealed last week that one member voted for a hike this time round. MNI said: [The] market is now pricing in a 44% chance of a 25bp rate hike in Nov 2017, up from 25% last Monday as Kristen Forbes calls for a 25bp rate hike due to rising inflation and better growth, while there was some hawkish undertones from some other members in the MPC minutes as well. UK rate rise expectations Photograph: MNI Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.41am EDT 07:41 News that the UK will trigger Article 50 and start the Brexit process in earnest on Wednesday 29 March has had little impact on the pound so far. Sterling has been drifting off its day’s peak as the morning wore on but is still at three week high against the dollar at $1.2412, up 0.15%. It remains virtually flat against the euro.

The search giant cracks down on hateful content. MANILA, Philippines – The quest to snuff out offensive content in mainstream web services takes another step as Google updates its content-flagging policies. Google's content review teams, a group of 10,000 contractors worldwide, now have the option of flagging offensive websites with the new "upsetting-offensive" flag. The review teams, officially known as "quality raters", analyze websites that appear in search results and score the quality of their content. Prior to the updated policies, the review teams have already been looking out for questionable content such as pornography. With the new guidelines, the raters will begin looking for racial slurs, hate or violence against particular groups of people, animal cruelty, child abuse and graphic violence. Also on their radar are instructional pieces that may be harmful to society such as how-to guides on human trafficking. The review data submitted by the raters, however, don't instantly affect search results. When they flag a website, it doesn't automatically go down in search rankings. Instead, the data is collected by Google, and is used to teach its algorithms what websites should rank high and what shouldn't when a person performs a search – with the hope of eventually producing better search results through time. (Read: How we can stop the hate) Hateful content has been in the crosshair of tech companies of late, with other tech giants like Facebook and Twitter also rolling out anti-hate methods. Most recently, Germany even proposed heavy fines on Facebook for hate speech. Google's updated policies indicate that the search giant is also on board in the fight against internet-assisted hate and bigotry. Google's full content review guidelines are available here. – Rappler.com Filed under:Google search results•hateful content•offensive content•search engines•Google HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Not the ideas of a dystopian fantasy novel, but a real world experience shared through a tweet by Bryson Meunier and shared via The Register: Now, we know Google is an ad company but it makes some cool stuff too, like the Pixel, Nest thermostat and the world’s most popular search engine. But what Google makes most money on is advertising. Although it’s not all Google makes money on, it also makes money on selling people Google Home, so you would think this product would be spared this sort of indignity. In a response for request, to Google, Tech site The Register got the following statement “This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales”. Read that again. It contains the world “beauty.” Even the response to the press has a secret advert built in. I jest of course, I’m sure it’s just an amusing coincidence. But Google’s flippant answer doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence. I’m sure users will tell Google this isn’t a good idea, and many may opt to switch Google Home for Amazon. But for many who use Android and live in the Google ecosystem, Home might be the most suitable product. READ  Google Map's New Feature Perhaps adverts don’t bother some people. They annoy me, but in the right context, I have no problem with them. For example, I’ve always wondered why Google Maps spoken turn-by-turn directions don’t throw in the occasional ad. “At the junction, make a right, these directions brought to you by McDonald’s doesn’t worry me quite so much as an intrusion into my home by a virtual assistant. And perhaps the problem here is that I kind of love my Echo. I feel like I’ve got to know Alexa through using it. I would dislike the experience of having it speak ads to me, but I don’t feel that same connection to spoken directions in a navigation app. Let me know your thoughts via Twitter, or just come to my house and shout them through the front door – it won’t be as invasive as Google Home it seems. Google Told Engadget in slightly more clear language that “this wasn’t intended to be an ad” and that it would “sometimes call out timely content”. I guess the question is, did Google get paid for this content?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Possible Android O features listed before official launch By Rei Padla - March 20, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter It’s that time of the year when the mobile community starts anticipating and speculating about the next Android platform version. We’re expecting it to be announced at the upcoming Google I/O Conference in May. Since February, Google has began teasing us by showing us Android Oreo and Android Pocky. The latter will be for next year but we don’t believe either of the two will use the names. So far, we heard Android O will receive new assistive and smarter features. We don’t expect confirmation anytime soon but we’re assuming more details will be leaked. We just read up some rumors about Android O. They’re still rumors at this point so take everything with a grain of salt. Going through the list, we can say this will be another important update complete with picture-in-picture mode, new notifications, smart text selection, and app icon badges for active notifications plus Google Assistant integration. Unlike last year, Google hasn’t released any Android O Developer Preview yet. You may remember that Nougat preview was ready as early as March. It was the earliest release ever since the Android team would usually release each new version during Summer. The Spring rollout last year was welcome but sadly, release by OEMs and networks have been slower. We’re hoping it will be different this year even if we don’t know much about the Android O yet. The next Android software will have a number of new features. Most of them are mainly enhancements but Google could be concealing the major ones for now. Here’s a rundown of the features we can expect on the upcoming Android O as shared by 9TO5Google: • App icon badges for active notifications. This feature could something we’ve been wanting since forever. This could offer a quicker glance at the number of notifications available for a particular app. • New notifications. This could refer to a different display of notifications–once again different from Android Nougat. There’s some hint of Andromeda but right now, we don’t have information about what Andromeda really is but we’ve been saying it is hybrid OS. • Smart text selection floating toolbar w/ Google Assistant integration. Feature is believed to “lessen” copy-paste moves by automatically copying important information found in apps and surfaces. Addresses may also come to text fields. We can also expect some finger gestures. • Picture-in-picture mode similar to Android TV. This could be the same picture mode that has been ready for the Android TV on iPads. There is a possibility that more devices will receive the same feature and not just tablets. • Restricted background activities from apps like Chrome 57. There could be changes to the Chrome browser including reduction in power consumption. App packground activities are expected to be more efficient and faster than ever. • MediaRecorder API improvements. The updated API is said to allow some apps to capture video and audio than save. Major improvements are expected to arrive on Android O but we have no idea how exactly. • Adaptive icons like Google Pixel. Nothing much to say here except they could be dynamically changing. We don’t know how it will be “adaptive” but we’re guessing they will “adapt” to whatever view or settings are set on default or maybe just any launcher. • More enterprise features. Last but not the least, since Google is getting more focused on the enterprise, it’s only apt that the developers include relevant features to Android. It has already started by introducing new products and services so now it’s time to upgrade mobile OS features.

Especially considering how much Google SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer seems to be trolling us with the name. Just as mysterious as the name, however is what the next major Android version will bring to the table, With just two months before Google actually announces its existence, rumors of features for Android O are starting to come in and, suffice to say, it’s going to have some pretty significant changes. Multi-taskers rejoice! Official picture-in-picture support, a.k.a. PIP, is finally coming. Actually, the PIP-related code was already introduced in Android Nougat but wasn’t enabled by default. Except for Android TV, where it does make sense. Soon, however, tablet and maybe even smartphone users will be able to watch their favorite videos while intensely working on that word document or spreadsheet. Icons on the home screen and launcher will also get an upgrade, finally. In Android O, apps with activate notifications, like e-mail or chat apps, will soon be able to show badges, a.k.a. small numbers, showing how many notifications are waiting to be read. Some third-party launchers have had feature for a while now, but it doesn’t always work across all apps as it was never an official feature. Now there should be some regularity to those implementations. Another icon-related new feature is “adaptive” or dynamic icons, like the ones on the Pixel Launcher. This just means that icons can change what they’re showing, depending on some condition. This is particularly useful in calendar apps which will soon be able to show the date instead of just a generic number. It’s probably worth noting that Android has taken quite some time to implement these two features that iOS users have already been enjoying for a long time. Some Android O changes naturally also go deep. The next version could supposedly adopt Chrome 57’s recently announced background throttling feature. This, in effect, would try to lessen the resource, especially battery, usage of apps and services running in the background. This could cut both ways, as users might annoyingly find apps having to reload more often than before, almost like what some iOS users complain about. Of course, all of these are based on leaks, so take them with a pinch of skepticism. If Google does choose to reveal of some these new features, it would probably do so at the upcoming Google I/O Developers Conference on May 17 to 19.

By Joe Mayes and Jeremy Kahn. Added by Agency Staff on 20 March 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Alphabet, BBC, Facebook, Google, Guardian News & Media, Havas, Martin Sorrell, Ronan Harris, WPP, YouTube Tweet Google, the primary revenue driver for Alphabet, announced changes to its advertising policies after major brands pulled ads from the platform because they appeared alongside offensive content, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism. The US company said in a blog post on Friday that it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the UK government and The Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France’s Havas, the world’s sixth largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its UK clients’ ads from Google and YouTube on Friday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads wouldn’t appear next to offensive material. Those clients include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail, the BBC, Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said in a statement. “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect,” said Paul Frampton, CEO and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside the UK, and called its UK unit’s decision “a temporary move”. “The Havas Group will not be undertaking such measures on a global basis,” a Havas spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. “We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK.” The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the UK government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Google made US$7,8bn in advertising revenue in the UK in 2016, accounting for 8,6% of the company’s total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook, claiming the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. The controversy about ads appearing in inappropriate contexts may give these media buyers leverage in negotiations with the social media giants. Martin Sorrell, the founder and CEO of WPP, the global advertising firm, said in a statement that Google and Facebook have “the same responsibilities as any media company” and could not “masquerade” as mere technology platforms. He said WPP’s GroupM, a major ad buyer, was talking to Google “at the highest levels to encourage them to find answers to these brand safety issues”. Ronan Harris, Google’s UK MD, said in the blog post that Google removed nearly two billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100 000 publishers from the company’s AdSense programme. Despite this, Harris wrote, “we don’t always get it right.” Harris said Google had “heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content”. Policy review The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Harris said. Ads appeared “next to extremist and hate-filled videos”, prompting Guardian News & Media to stop all advertising through YouTube parent Google, the British publisher said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. The UK government said it suspended advertising on YouTube until the site can ensure they’re not placed next to content it doesn’t approve of. “Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content,” the UK government said in an e-mailed statement. “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.” Britain’s government said it summoned Google for discussions to explain how it can guarantee the state’s demands are met, while on Tuesday Germany threatened to fine social networks such as Facebook as much as €50m if they fail to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refuse to remove illegal content. British supermarket chain J Sainsbury, whose ads appeared on videos posted by the white nationalist Polish Defence League, said it and its sister brand Argos would immediately suspend all Google advertising. “It is unacceptable that Google is allowing our ads to be placed alongside these videos on YouTube,” the company said in an e-mailed statement. It said it was seeking “urgent assurances” from Google that the problems were being addressed. The Guardian said it would be withdrawing its advertising until Google could provide guarantees that the ad misplacement wouldn’t happen in future. “It is completely unacceptable that Google allows advertising for brands like the Guardian to appear next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” Guardian News & Media said. L’Oreal, the cosmetics brand, said it was unaware that ads it was running in connection with the Prince’s Trust, a charity founded by Prince Charles that helps train disadvantaged young people for work, were appearing on YouTube channels associated with extremists. “We are horrified that our campaign — which is the total antithesis of this extreme, negative content — could be seen in connection with them,” the company said in a statement. L’Oreal said it planned to work more closely with Google to make sure it didn’t happen again.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 77Expert warns SA on too much renewable energy 37ANC mulls plan to end DStv ‘monopoly’ 4Cell C swings to net profit of R540m 2IFC coy on Net1 allegations 2Zuma to lead grants reform Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

If you want to keep your emails on Google's services more secure you'll need to do more than just enable two-factor authentication. You need to practice safe browsing, steering clear of sites and emails that could steal your info. Below are four third-party add-ons you can plug into Gmail to help your navigate the internet a little more safely. They range from add-ons to protect you from phishing attacks (when a hacker tries to social engineer your password out of you) to add-ons to keep Google from peeping at what you send through their email servers. 1) SecureGmail Image: SecureGmail Probably the best name for an add-on designed to improve Gmail security, and there's no doubt SecureGmail is very useful for the privacy-conscious — it encrypts and decrypts all the emails you send and receive in Gmail, before they ever reach Google's servers, so you know that if anyone else should try and extract the contents they won't be able to do so — including Google itself. At the other end the recipient of your email needs a specified password to understand and decode the message, but you don't have to apply this encryption to everything you send through Gmail, so you can save it just for the most sensitive stuff. Like all the best Gmail browser add-ons, it integrates with the original web interface in a clean and seamless way. 2) Ugly Email Image: Screenshot There are plenty of emailers out there who'd like to know when and where you open your messages so they apply a tracker to notify them when you've opened it. If you're not really into that kind of tracking behaviour then there's Ugly Email — add the extension to Chrome and you get a simple eye icon inside your Gmail account on the web if an email contains some kind of tracker. This add-on is for informative purposes only, so you can't really do anything about the tracking except choose not to open up the offending message or have words with the person who sent it, but we like its simple approach and ease-of-use. At the very least you become more aware of the sort of messages coming into your inbox, which is always useful. 3) Gmail Sender Icons Image: Screenshot As the name suggests, Gmail Sender Icons is a Chrome extension that puts favicon symbols next to senders in Gmail, so you can quickly visualise which domain each message is coming from. It gives you that same at-a-glance ease-of-use that you get when looking through the open tabs in your browser, but built right into your Gmail inbox, with virtually no slowdown in speed. So how does it keep you safe? It's another way of flagging spam emails that aren't from respectable sources, and you can spot the potentially dodgy messages before you open them up, or indeed use it to save genuine messages from the Spam folder. The extension itself doesn't store any data, simply parsing your inbox to come up with its labelling. 4) Password Alert Image: Google This last one is from Google itself: A Chrome extension that helps keep you safe against any phishing attempts that may wander into your inbox. It watches out for Google sign-in pages that aren't actually Google sign-in pages, and should you get duped into entering your account password, you'll then get an instant warning asking you to reset it to something else. The extension works by storing a "thumbnail" of your password for comparison purposes, rather than the password itself. And while Gmail already does a decent job of watching out for emails that aren't genuine, shifting them to the Spam folder so you don't get chance to be fooled, but there's no harm in upgrading your protection — plenty of us are still at risk.

If we talk about only one email service provider "Gmail", we may have the huge amount of gmail users and as per my research, Gmail has now upto 900 Million active users. From these Millions, thousands of people victim to the hacking and phishing attempts weekly. While it's good to use mentioned above addons but people might also have to look on the following ways to keep their Gmail account secure which as explained here https://www.purevpn.com/blog/10-ways-to-keep-your-gmail-account-secure/ Last edited March 20, 2017 8:52 pm Reply 0 Join the discussion!

The top ten was dominated by Northern Europe, with Norway taking out the top spot. The only countries in the Southern Hemisphere to make the cut were New Zealand and Australia - with the former beating the latter. That's right. Kiwis are officially happier and have better lives than their Antipodean neighbours. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter? Subscribe Have a tip? Contact our editors!

The rumours have already started going around with reports of Google dropping the 3.5-mm headphone jack. The latest rumour about the upcoming flagship comes as a report by Droid-Life. According to the report, Google may be working on a third smartphone under the codename ‘taimen’ to be launched as part of the Google Pixel 2 lineup.

There are no details about the lineup except the code names for other two smartphones, ‘Muskie’ and ‘Walleye’. ‘Muskie’ is supposed to be the bigger 5.5-inch device while the other device, ‘walleye’ will be a smaller device with 5-inch screen size. The third smartphone ‘taimen’ might simply be called Google Pixel 2 XXL if the company follows the route of a screen size larger than 6 inches. This comes almost a month after it was confirmed that the upcoming Google Pixel 2 smartphones will be premium flagship devices instead of a mid-range or watered down versions of the powerful Pixel lineup. The smartphones are expected to come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 83X processors along with the rumoured Android O release.

The US company said in a blog post Friday it would give advertisers more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites and against search engine results. The announcement came after the UK government and the Guardian newspaper stepped up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform, pulling ads from the video site because they appeared beside clips they view as inappropriate. The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the UK government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Ronan Harris, Google's UK managing director, said in the blog post that last year Google removed nearly 2 billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from the company's ad sense program. Despite this, Harris wrote in the blog post, "we don't always get it right." He said Google had "heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content." The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes "in the coming weeks" to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Harris said. Ads appeared "next to extremist and hate-filled videos," prompting Guardian News & Media to stop all advertising through YouTube parent Google, the British publisher said in an emailed statement Friday. The UK government said it suspended advertising on YouTube until the site can ensure they're not placed next to content it doesn't approve of. "Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content," the UK government said in an emailed statement. "We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way." The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Britain's government said it summoned Google for discussions to explain how it can guarantee the state's demands are met, while on Tuesday Germany threatened to fine social networks such as Facebook as much as EUR 50 million ($53 million) if they fail to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refuse to remove illegal content. British supermarket chain J Sainsbury, whose ads appeared on videos posted by the white nationalist Polish Defence League, said it and its sister brand Argos would immediately suspend all Google advertising. "It is unacceptable that Google is allowing our ads to be placed alongside these videos on YouTube," the company said in an emailed statement. It said it was seeking "urgent assurances" from Google that the problems were being addressed. The Guardian said it would be withdrawing its advertising until Google could provide guarantees that the ad misplacement wouldn't happen in future. "It is completely unacceptable that Google allows advertising for brands like the Guardian to appear next to extremist and hate-filled videos," Guardian News & Media said. © 2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Source: AAP 20 Mar 2017 - 4:58 PM  UPDATED 20 Mar 2017 - 4:58 PM Tweet Australian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman Wayne Byres says there's a ready-made Australian market for the likes of Apple and Google should the US tech giants expand into the financial services industry. "Financial services ultimately is an industry that's built on trust and if you think about the next generation that's coming through, certainly when I think about my kids, the brands they trust - Apple, Google - it's the technology brands," Mr Byres said on Monday. "They wouldn't have a clue about the four major banks that we have here ... (and) as far as my kids are concerned, they have accounts with Apple so we're not actually that far away." A KPMG report released last week suggested 84 per cent of millennials would consider banking with a tech giant if they offered a better product or deal than a traditional bank, and Mr Byres said there was little to prevent more competition. Apple already offers Apple Pay - which allows iPhone users to use their device like a contactless credit or debit card - in more than a dozen countries, including through ANZ, Macquarie, MyState and others in Australia. There could be scope within current regulations for the Cupertino-based giant to issue credit cards, mortgages and small business lending should it so choose. "At this point they're playing in particular places - particularly focused on the payments space rather than seeking to be a broader financial services offering - and I think the system in the way it's set up can accommodate that, but its not hugely difficult to envisage them offering a range of other services and that will test the regulatory model," Mr Byers said at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's annual forum in Sydney. "You can do anything in this country without an APRA licence except for one thing and that's take a deposit." ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft said he expects Apple, Google or Amazon to target areas they see as undeserved, as Chinese retail giant Alibaba has done with small business lending. "What puts the fear into the heart of banks is the prospect of Amazon in particular. I think they're coming," Mr Medcraft said. "Amazon might buy one of the banks, who knows?"

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Google’s Code Jam Offers A Prize Pool of $15,000 Rehan Ahmed 6 days ago Ever felt like you had a talent for solving logic puzzles using code? Participated in any speed programming competitions recently? Feel like you are up for a bigger challenge? Well, here is your chance; Google Code Jam 2017. What is Google Code Jam? Code Jam is one of the world’s most challenging programming competitions in the world and is being held for the 14th time this year. It is a global contest which consists of multiple rounds of algorithmic puzzles. Anyone can register for it online and participate in the Qualifying rounds. Once you pass those, you progress on to the next round. Each round consists of 3-4 problems and a time limit. In 2016, Code Jam consisted of 7 rounds including the World Finals at the end. The World Final is the only one that is not conducted online, and this year, it will be held at Google’s office in Dublin, Ireland in August. “25 of the best code jammers will compete with last year’s champion for the title of the “Code Jam World Champion” and a grand prize of $15,000.” Moreover, the top 1,500 performers will be given a limited edition Code Jam T-shirt. How can I register? Anyone can register for Code Jam by going to their official site. You will need a Google account to sign up for it. The deadline to register is 7th of April, 23:00 UTC. You will be able to load the contests dashboard two hours before the contest starts. However, the problems will be only visible once the contest has officially started. How to prepare for it? Google has uploaded every single problem given in Code Jam competitions since 2008 over here. You can try your hand at them and see if you are able to solve them by yourself in the given time limit. You need to have a good background in some programming language like C, Java, C++, Python, etc. There is no restriction in what language can you use but do note that Google doesn’t recommend using Python due to its slowness when handling large datasets. You can also participate in the contest if you have no knowledge in programming but know how to solve algorithms. In such a case, you can solve a problem by hand. For more details, visit Code Jam’s page for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) or go through their Quick Start Guide. Google is more than just a search box. It is a technology behemoth. From search to self-driving cars, mapping the world to holding summer coding programs for students, from making phones to owning the world’s largest video and music streaming hub, the company is everywhere. Code Jam is just one of the many competitions it holds, attracting thousands of avid coders from around the world each year.

Friday 24th March, 2017 Menu Home Europe News Breaking Business News Sports News Weather Network Volume No. 083/2017 After British government pulls ads from Google, now big banks and brands cancel ads too Northern Ireland News - Sunday 19th March, 2017 Three of Britain’s biggest banks have pulled advertising from Google Vodafone, Sky and Barclays are also considering withdrawing their marketing from Google Google announced changes to its advertising policies LONDON, U.K. - Days after the U.K. government withdrew all of its taxpayer-funded adverts from YouTube after the adverts were seen next to extremist videos on the platform - now Britain’s biggest banks and brands have joined in.  According to reports, Google was slammed by MPs over content control after the revelation was made during an investigation conducted by The Times. The probe revealed that Holocaust deniers, racist websites and rape apologists received payouts from Google for YouTube commercials.  The Government had argued that it was Google’s responsibility to ensure adverts do not appear alongside ‘inappropriate’ content. Now, three of Britain’s biggest banks have pulled advertising from Google including HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland after their marketing appeared alongside extremist YouTube videos too. The list of big advertisers who have withdrawn marketing from the search engine and its YouTube video platform continued to grow in the aftermath of the expose. McDonald’s, L’Oréal, Armani, Audi and the BBC have all withdrawn advertisement.  Their adverts of many top companies and the government were posted alongside videos by white nationalist and a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub   According to reports, a commercial appearing alongside a YouTube clip earns the video’s poster about 6 pounds for every 1,000 views and many of Duke’s videos have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Google, that controls 35 percent of the digital advertising market, is set to suffer a setback after the departure of HSBC, Lloyds and RBS.  According to an executive at one of Britain’s biggest advertisers, “This is now a very serious problem for Google. It has to get its house in order.” Further, the French marketing agency Havas, that spends about 35 million pounds a year on the search engine on behalf of U.K.-based advertisers - pulled Google advertising for 240 U.K. clients, including include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail, government-owned British Broadcasting Corp., Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia.  Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group U.K. said in a statement, “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect.” The parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside the U.K., adding that its U.K. unit’s decision was “a temporary move." A spokeswoman said, “The Havas Group will not be undertaking such measures on a global basis. We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the U.K.” As the crisis deepens, reports pointed out that Vodafone, Sky and Barclays are also considering withdrawing their marketing from Google. According to Sky, “It is clearly un­acceptable for ads to be appearing alongside inappropriate content and we are talking with Google to understand what they are doing to stop this happening.” Meanwhile, Google has said that it is launching a review of its advertising policies after the Government sought answers from the internet giant.  A Government spokeswoman had earlier stated, “Google is responsible for ensuring that the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content.” Subsequently, Google executives were summoned to Whitehall to explain themselves, following which Google’s U.K. head said, “We don't always get it right.” Commenting on the incident in a blog post, U.K. Managing Director Ronan Harris explained that in a “small percentage of cases” automatic systems to keep ads off extreme content failed. He said, “We’ve heard from our advertisers and agencies loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content. While we have a wide variety of tools to give advertisers and agencies control over where their ads appear, such as topic exclusions and site category exclusions, we can do a better job of addressing the small number of inappropriately monetized videos and content. We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network.” He went on to defend YouTube's openess and insisted that Google does “believe strongly in the freedom of speech and expression on the web.” According to Harris, Google removed “two billion bad ads,” blocked 100,000 publishers from receiving advertising support, and stopped ads from from appearing on 300,000 videos in 2016. The company added in a blog post that it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. Earlier Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper had argued, “YouTube say they don't even check proactively to stop banned or terrorist organisations like National Action from posting content, or check proactively for online child abuse. You Tube's enforcement of their own community standards is a joke. They rightly say ''it is not acceptable to post malicious, hateful comments about a group of people solely based on their race.” Yet they claim that anti-Semitic videos from white supremacists like David Duke don't breach their standards. These are incredibly powerful organisations. They are able to analyse algorithms and behaviour in a sophisticated way in order to target potential consumers with adverts. It's time they used more of that power, money and technology to deal with hate crime and to keep people safe.” Share article: Watch latest videos Subscribe and Follow Get a daily dose of Northern Ireland News news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.

Friday 24th March, 2017 Menu Home Europe News Breaking Business News Sports News Weather Network Volume No. 083/2017 Taxpayer-funded ads appear on extremist videos on YouTube, infuriating U.K. government Northern Ireland News - Saturday 18th March, 2017 Google has launched a review of its advertising policies The Government demanded answers on why taxpayer-funded ads appear on extremist videos The Government has withdrawn adverts from YouTube until it gets reassurances LONDON, U.K. - The U.K. government has withdrawn all of its taxpayer-funded adverts from YouTube after the adverts were seen next to extremist videos on the platform. According to reports, Google was slammed by MPs over content control after the revelation was made. Google, in fact, was among three companies that were thrashed by MPs on the Home Affairs Committee in Parliament this week.  In the aftermath, the Transport for London, Channel 4, L'Oreal, Sainsbury's and Argos are also set to withdraw advertising.   Meanwhile, Google said that it is launching a review of its advertising policies after the Government sought answers on the occurrence.  The Government has argued that it was Google’s responsibility to ensure adverts do not appear alongside ‘inappropriate’ content. A Government spokeswoman said, “Google is responsible for ensuring that the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content. Google has been summoned for discussions at the Cabinet Office to explain how it will deliver the high quality of service that government demands on behalf of the taxpayer.” Subsequently, Google executives were summoned to Whitehall to explain themselves, following which Google’s U.K. head said, “We don't always get it right.” Commenting on the incident in a blog post, U.K. Managing Director Ronan Harris explained that in a “small percentage of cases” automatic systems to keep ads off extreme content failed.

Friday 24th March, 2017 Menu Home Europe News Breaking Business News Sports News Weather Network Volume No. 083/2017 Google introduces new content flag to clamp down on inaccurate and offensive content Northern Ireland News - Friday 17th March, 2017 Google gave its new tool to its quality raters, i.e. its global review teams Google uses the data from its quality raters to help improve its search algorithms Google says the new flag should be applied to any results which promote hate or violence against a group of people CALIFORNIA, U.S. - In a bid to crack down on potentially unsuitable content, such as pornography or fake news - Google has introduced a new "upsetting-offensive" content flag to its search engine guidelines. The company said that its renewed efforts to clamp down on inaccurate and offensive content, in the form of the new tool, has been given to its quality raters, that is its global review teams.  The team will now analyse real search results Google sends them and are tasked with flagging potentially unsuitable content. This data, along with other parameters will help Google improve its search algorithms.  Senior engineer Paul Haahr was quoted on industry blog Search Engine Land as saying, “We're explicitly avoiding the term 'fake news,' because we think it is too vague. Demonstrably inaccurate information, however, we want to target." Google mentions in the update guidelines that the new flag should be applied to any results which promote hate or violence against a group of people based on race, religion, ethnicity, graphic violence or explicit information on how to carry out harmful activities, as well as content that would be deemed offensive or upsetting in specific regions around the world. According to reports, the guidelines for quality raters is said to include example searches to demonstrate the feature in use, including one for "holocaust history" which shows two conflicting results referencing the atrocity. Further elaborating, the report mentions, the first result suggests the Holocaust "didn't happen" and the guidelines say this should be marked as "upsetting-offensive" by raters because many people would find such a suggestion offensive. A second example result from The History Channel is classed as a "factually accurate source of historical information" and would not be marked with the flag. While flagging items does not remove or demote it in search results, it helps Google's machine learning better identify offensive content. Since the U.S. Presidential elections last year, all social media giants, including Google, Facebook and Twitter have been criticised over their handling of offensive and explicit content. The circulation of fake news has been prominently criticised over the last few months in several countries.

Photo: Reuters Google has announced a new open source algorithm that will encode high-quality JPEG with 35 percent smaller files, without the loss of quality. “Guetzli, meaning 'cookie' in Swiss German, is a JPEG encoder for digital images and web graphics that can enable faster online experiences by producing smaller JPEG files while still maintaining compatibility with existing browsers, image processing applications and the JPEG standard,” the company said Thursday on its official blog. With the new JPEG encoder, Google aims to help webmasters, graphic designers and photographers make the user experience smoother. Evidently, the idea is to reduce the uploading time and data costs for mobile users, with a considerably smaller file size without compromising on image quality. As Google explained in its blog, the Guetzli follows a multi-stage compression process, which includes color space transform, discrete cosine transform and quantization. Guetzli specifically focuses on quantization, which simply means that it uses a technique to compress a range of values to a single quantum value. For example, reducing the number of colors needed to represent an image digitally will also help in reducing the size of the file. “Guetzli’s psychovisual model, which approximates color perception and visual masking in a more thorough and detailed way than what is achievable by simpler color transforms and the discrete cosine transform,” the company said. Even as the idea behind the new algorithm is to reduce the file size of a JPEG, as per Google, in comparison to other encoders, Guetzli produces better image quality in a similar file size. In an experiment conducted by Cornell University Library, which was cited by Google, 75 percent respondents preferred Guetzli to linjpeg-generated images. The new JPEGs are compatible to most present generation devices and browsers, and Guetzli is also free of cost. This is not the first time efforts have been made to compress an image size without compromising the quality. Microsoft's JPEG XR, Google's WebP and RAISR image formats are among the few that have tried similar things in the past, but could not surpass JPEG’s popularity. This is precisely why Google, this time around, decided to continue with the format and instead change the compression method.

Master the many ways to search with Google on your Android phone Search faster and smarter by learning all of the various places and ways to perform a Google search on Android. Derek Walter on 13 March, 2017 22:00 0 - - - - print email IDG It’s quite easy to do a Google search on Android. Maybe too easy. The deep tie-in is an important feature, and one of the reasons Android is the superior choice for those who rely so much on Google services. Yet, sometimes picking out just how to do a Google search is like choosing from among 12 shades of blue shirts you have hanging in the closet. There’s the persistent Google search bar that lives on your home screen. The Omnibox in Google Chrome, voice searches and contextual tools from the Google Assistant, the Google app, and an always-present search button in Gboard. We get that Google wants to be helpful and all, but sometimes it feels like that overeager know-it-all you remember from fourth grade. Not to worry! Each of these different search methods have their own particular strenth. If you learn the nuances, your Android use will be even more powerful. It can be done, and here are some tips that show you how. OK, Google Voice and artificial intelligence have been the most noteworthy innovations in how Google search works on Android. Now, most phones running Nougat and Marshmallow have or should soon receive the Google Assistant. Not only are you able to issue edicts and ask questions to Google from your phone, but you also usually get more contextual answers and control over smart devices. From the Google app and Google Home you get a pretty exhaustive rundown of sample questions you can ask. Greenbot The Google Assistant is ready to answer just about any question you have. What I’ve learned over time with my Pixel is that the best searches to use here are ones that you’d consider a natural language query. Questions like, “Who won the World Series last year?” or “How long do I barbecue sausage?” are among the wide range of things you can ask. For personal organization, try asking, “When is my next appointment?” if you keep all your key events of the day in Google Calendar. Greenbot Ask a question, and you’ll often get an answer. If you haven’t done so yet, you need to tell Google to listen to voice queries whenever you announce, “OK, Google.” Go to Google > Settings > Voice. Touch “OK Google detection” and then flip on “Say ‘OK Google any time’ so that your phone will listen you. You can also select a “Trusted Voice,” which in theory means that only you will be able to start a voice search. You’ll be asked to speak the phrase, “OK Google” a few times, but I’ve yet to see it make a major difference in differentiating between who is speaking. I can’t tell you how many times a TV commercial for the Pixel or Google Home has set off the search. Despite that occasional annoyance, you’ll find the Google Assistant is a great tool to have. About that Google bar There’s an ever-present Google search tool at the top of your phone. It’s a big G on the Pixel or a traditional search box on other Android devices. It does a lot more than search the web, and it’s better suited than other search methods on Android for a few particular uses. This is where I tend to turn to first if I’m just unlocking my phone and not using another app. The search query could be anything, and I find you’ll get the result faster if you use less conversational, more "search term based" language. Be direct and you’ll find the information quickly. It’s especially a fast way to get sports information, often doing so much quicker than opening ESPN or another league-specific sports app. Greenbot The Google search bar finds apps, scores, and of course taps into the giant’s massive database of information. This search feature also will dig inside of your apps. This means it’ll pull up text conversations, app names, emails, and other information. The content is saved on device, so it’s not part of the massive data-mining operation Google has on you with other services. Greenbot Find content from inside your apps with the Google app. This means it performs more like Apple’s Spotlight on iOS. However, developers have to do some work on their end to enable this magic. To find out which apps are eligible, or to opt one out, go to Google > Settings > In-apps. Greenbot Select which apps you want Google to dig through during your next search query. Don’t forget about Chrome By now you know that Chrome has Google searched baked right into the Omnibox. I find that Chrome is the best place for search in a couple of circumstances. First, if you’re already in Chrome it’s faster to just touch the Omnibox or open a new tab and start your query. If reading is on your mind, you’ll be able to jump right to a frequently-accessed app or scroll down to get a list of article suggestions, much like Google Now. Greenbot Chrome is all about the web, giving you links to the sites you regularly visit and providing a similar layout to search on the desktop. I also tend to go with Chrome if I know that my result is likely to be something that I’ll be taken into reading for awhile, such as a Wikipedia page a publication I visit often. Also, it means I can access this Chrome page on another device thanks to the syncing feature. A smart screen scanner Google’s screen context search tool (formerly called Google Now on Tap) has steadily improved over time to be a very useful feature. The Google app will “read” the contents of your screen and then suggest what it deems are relevant actions and searches. To try this, touch and hold the home button and then swipe up to reveal what Google has come up with. Greenbot Use Google’s screen search to find out more details or create a calendar entry from a conversation. For me, it’s most useful when chatting about making plans and I want to find out more about the venue or quickly add the event to my calendar. This is one of those machine learning features that continues to get better over time so try it out under a lot of different circumstances to see what works best for you. A search smart keyboard But wait, there’s more. Yes, if you use Google’s Gboard, there’s a dedicated search button right at the top of the keys. So, when should you use this other search opportunity? Perhaps if you need to know something right away that’s relevant to your conversation and you don’t want to switch apps. Greenbot Gboard is useful, even though it seems like it’s duplication of service. The search bar is handy, but it’s awfully close to overkill. Gboard' search came first to the iPhone, presumably as a way to get Google search more readily available on iOS. With so many system-level choices to search Google on Android, you may not need it that much. It can give you the weather quickly, however, and it does a killer job finding GIFs. So there you have it. You’ll go less batty with Google search if you know exactly where and when to use it. Play around and see what’s best for you. And if you’re not sure, well, you have plenty of ways to Google it. Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 More from Microsoft Windows 10 Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too!

Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

There might be some scenarios where you would have wanted to export or save your Google Sheet as JSON or XML file format but unfortunately Google Sheets simply don’t support both of these file extensions for export and import. The method explained in this tutorial incorporates a Google Sheet add-on which simply gives you the option to export your Google Sheet with any number of sheets as a JSON or XML file. This add-on offers a number of different options to format the exported JSON and XML file and choose to export cell values as JSON arrays or objects. For XML, you can specify the root element as well. Sponsored Links Other useful Google Sheets tutorials that you can check: How to convert a Google Sheet as Google Doc. How to delete or hide multiple blank rows in Google Sheets. How to export Google Sheet data as JSON and XML: As I mentioned, you can properly format the JSON or XML file which will have your Google Sheets data. The best part is that it can export data from all sheets or selected sheets in JSON and XML format. All you have to do is run this add-on and specify the formatting options of the exported file. It then compiles the Google Sheet into the desired file format and save it in your Google Drive folder i.e. in the same folder where your Google Sheet is kept. Another exciting feature is that you can view the JSON or XML file before exporting the Google Sheet data into them. While exporting to a JSON file format, you get the options to choose whether you want to export each cell as a JSON array, entire sheet content as an array of JSON objects, or export the entire Google Sheet as a single JSON object, and many other options. So, this add-on can help you to export Google Sheet data to a specific JSON format as per your needs. You get the similar types of options to format the structure of the output XML file as you can choose to export column cells as child elements, choose a character to replace illegal characters in Google Sheet to XML, etc. Let’s now see the steps to export a Google Sheet as a JSON or XML file: Step 1: Install Export Google Sheet add-on from the link at the end of this tutorial and then open the Google Sheet you want to export. This add-on will then ask permission for you to run, allow it to run and after that you can start using this Google Sheets add-on to export your Google Sheet data as a JSON or XML file. Below is the screenshot of the Google Sheet which I will be exporting as an XML and JSON file. Step 2: Now, open the interface of  Export Sheet Data add-on from Add-ons > Export Sheet Data > Open Sidebar. This will open up a sidebar, as shown in the screenshot below from where you can choose the desired file format and customize formatting options to export the sheet data as per your requirements. Select a file format i.e. JSON or XML from the drop-down list at the top and the specific sheets that you want to export. As per your selected file format, you will see the options to format the structure of the output file. I have already mentioned most of the useful formatting options above. So, you can select these options so as to export the sheet data as per the intended format. To select these options, hover your mouse at end of the label string and then enable the checkbox that appears. That is quite an unusual way to enable users to select options, it took around 10 minutes to figure out how to use the formatting options. It would have been lot better if the checkboxes were made visible without hovering mouse for better user experience. If you want to inspect the data file to be exported to JSON or XML format, click on the “Visualize” button which will show you the preview of the output file. At last, click on the Export button to compile the Google Sheet into the selected file format. You can then download the exported file or find it in the same Drive folder of your Google Sheet. So, in this way, you can export a Google Sheet to XML or JSON file. The screenshot below displays the exported XML file. After that, I exported the same Google Sheet as JSON file, which is shown in the screenshot below. Verdict: This tutorial explains how to export Google Sheets data as JSON and XML file by using a free Google Sheets add-on. The method just involves a couple of steps to export Google Sheets to JSON or XML format with proper structure. Get Export Sheet Data.

By India Ashok March 20, 2017 04:46 GMT Vodafone, Sky, HSBC, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland have also reportedly pulled adverts from Google and YouTubeGetty Images Google is set to face inquiries from the advertising industry and the British government over recent concerns raised about ads being placed next to extremist content. An array of high-profile firms, advertising companies and government departments have already pulled their adverts from the tech giant, with more mulling doing the same. Vodafone, Sky, HSBC, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland have also thrown in their hat to the growing list of firms pulling out of featuring their ads on Google. Google's European head Matt Brittin and head of Google's agencies business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Mark Howe are slated to speak at the upcoming annual Advertising Week Europe event, the Guardian reported citing unspecified sources. Brittin is likely to face a barrage of questions on how major firms' adverts ended up being displayed alongside extremist content, such as those posted by hate preachers and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke. Experts reportedly estimated that extremists could have made around £250,000 from ads placed next to their YouTube videos. Brittin will likely be one of Google's first executives to address the issue at the event, which will take place in London starting Monday (20 March) and conclude on 24 March. The tech giant is also likely to face questions from the British government. Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee reportedly accused Google of "profiting from hatred," in a letter to the firm. The firm's senior executives were summoned to the Cabinet Office last week over fears that taxpayer-funded ads were displayed among "inappropriate" YouTube videos. Google's execs allegedly apologised and were asked to return to the Cabinet Office this week with a formulated plan on resolving the issue. Although Google is yet to disclose its plans on how it intends handle the matter, reports speculate that advertisers may be told that they are not making enough use of existing tools. The tech giant may offer to provide further support to firms on how to make better use of the features. Google UK managing director said last week, "We've heard from our advertisers and agencies loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content."

A few years ago, chat applications were about as welcome in the enterprise as a piece of malware. Chat was seen as time wasting, something that network managers would look to lock out of the corporate network. And then came Slack, and it became apparent that “chat” isn’t superfluous to business – it’s at the heart of it. Slack’s ability to penetrate the corporate network at the level of individual teams hasn’t gone unnoticed in Redmond. What some people might have seen as a threat to Microsoft’s business, it has seen as an opportunity: a chance to create a new product that can sit at the heart of Office 365 and offer something different to its customers – and potentially attract businesses that might otherwise go to Google.   Teams is more than just a bolt-on to Office 365. It’s designed to take advantage of deep underlying Office technologies such as Groups and the Microsoft Graph to make an experience that is richer and more seamless than the platform-centric approach of competitors such as Slack. Owning the whole ecosystem also gives Microsoft some advantages over Slack. Slack integrations tend to be one way – bringing information into Slack – rather than two-way. You can bring a Google Doc into Slack, for example, but there’s no way to see a Slack conversation about that document once you’re viewing it on Google’s platform. The potential is there for Microsoft to do this with Teams, for example allowing a conversation about a Word document originated in Teams to be part of the document’s comments when you’re viewing it in Word. Rather than being a funnel into which data flows, as Slack is now, information from Teams can flow out into the wider Office 365 ecosystem. This kind of deep, rich integration is largely for the future, but assuming Microsoft goes down this path, it’s hard to see how Slack would keep up. Google, of course, could, and its recent announcement of an update to Hangouts that makes it more "Slack-like" could be the start of this. Microsoft’s biggest challenge, though, may be something beyond its control: its customers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many large organisations that have begun to deploy Office 365 have been slow to embrace the tools beyond the “core” familiar suite of Office applications. Word, Excel, PowerPoint and SharePoint are embraced widely in the corporate environment. Delve, Planner, Sway and the other new Office tools are deployed slowly, if at all. One organisation I’m familiar with moved to Office 365 a year ago: at this point, it’s only just fully deployed the 365 versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Tools such as Teams, Delve and the rest rely on companies being ready to work in more agile ways. Some corporates are embracing this, as they realise that being more agile is the only way they’ll compete with leaner, hungrier new companies in the future. And agility is more than just a question of the technology you deploy: half the job is to change the culture of a company and embrace new ways of working. Microsoft can provide all the tools you need to do this, but what it can’t provide is the ability to change your business’ culture.

Thursday, March 23, 2017 | 08:51 PM Phuket  28.2 °C or 82.8 °F | 5 Day Forecast Phuket's Number One for NEWS, since 1993 Home News Business Property Sports Lifestyle Press Direct Phuket Forum Phuket Radio Phuket TV Events Yellow Pages Classifieds I&A Mobile Jobs | Archived | Latest Home / Business / Phuket Business / Business Buzz: Establish your online presence from scratch Phuket Business Business Buzz: Establish your online presence from scratch Phuket Gazette - March 20, 2017 | 11:00 AM            Using the right tools is important to get your business started on the right foot. Photo: Pexels PHUKET: Many people have asked me how to get started with an online presence, so I have put together a quick overview assuming I was starting from scratch (but knowing what I do now). Facebook Page The very first thing you could do is start a Facebook fan page. This can easily be set up without any skill, cost or time delays and you can connect with a few billion people instantly. You could pay someone on fiverr.com to design a cover photo and profile picture and set it up as a local business. An early priority would be to quickly get some content up, and invite all your Facebook friends to like and share the page. Where possible, get testimonials from satisfied customers, and later post these on other forms of media (videos are best for this purpose). Website The next step would be to get a website. If budget is a concern, do it on Google Sites, or a platform like Wix or Weebly. If you have enough funding, it is also a good idea to hire a professional company to make the website. Your main priority would be branding, providing informative content, and most importantly, lead generation. So, you would want it to look professional, cover important information and brand your business as an expert in the relevant field. Ensure that you have a lead generation capture tool, which would double as a Client Management System and auto responder (sends automated messages to all of your interested leads). There are several suitable off-the-shelf options available. You should also make sure that Google Analytics is added to the site by someone who knows what they are doing, and have someone do a once over for security, SEO and functionality. Facebook PPC To get the word out to potential clients immediately, start some ads and post boosts to your target audience. You could do a full day’s course about audience selection and strategy, but the important thing is to get started with a small amount and learn as you go, or if the budget allows just outsource it. Instagram Instagram is a great visual platform, so make sure that content is going out there. For high quality content, hire a freelancer if your skills are not that great. Google My Business This gets you listed in Google Search and Google Maps, and given that this is the tool automatically included on most Android and Apple devices, you would not want to miss out. YouTube Depending on the business, a YouTube site could be helpful. Video is very powerful, and the first thing to do is to get video testimonials about your product or service, focusing on the best-selling points of the business. Automation The final thing is to automate as much as possible, not because you are lazy, but because your time is better spent on your core business. However, marketing is a necessary evil, so daily content is key, and you either outsource it or make it as easy for yourself as possible. There are great software, apps and tools available to make this easy. This is a quick and high level article to get you started, but I'd be happy to answer questions in the comments section. Good luck in your endeavors. Simon Wetherell is a social media expert, trainer and lawyer.

Leon Spencer (ARN) 20 March, 2017 13:48 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology NEXTGEN rhipe Synnex Westcon – Comstor XiT Distribution Vendors Oracle Comments Daryl Wilding-McBride (DiUS); Pavi De Alwis (DiUS); Voon Wong (DiUS) and Nigel Hooke (DiUS) In January, IBM announced that it was merging the artificial intelligence [AI] tools of fellow tech powerhouse, Google, with its own cognitive computing technologies. The aim of the move is to allow its deep-learning systems to more accurately come up with answers for thorny questions. Meanwhile, also at the turn of the year, Apple became the latest tech company to sign up to the Partnership on AI alliance, joining rivals such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Facebook to help advance research and development of AI technologies. Such high-level cooperation among traditional competitors illustrates just how important this capability has become in the modern IT market. Deep-learning, AI, machine learning – whatever you want to call it – is making its way into the mainstream technology mix, both in the consumer world and the enterprise. This technology is already all around us. You know those annoying live chat windows that pop up on some websites to ask you if you need help? Yep, the chatbots behind those are often powered by machine learning technology. Do you have a personal assistant on your phone? If you’ve got an Apple iPhone or a Google Android- powered phone, you do. Those are driven by various forms of AI, machine learning, and cognitive platforms as well. Many of these capabilities are now nestled in the cloud offerings of companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Oracle, giving way to the emergence of the intelligent cloud. The intelligent cloud, as it currently stands, comes in many shapes and sizes, with different aspects of cloud-based intelligent learning technology being presented in a variety of offerings that lend themselves to different applications and solutions. Rod Bryan - Lead Partner of Solution 49x, KPMG Australia's cognitive and AI business division Still early days For many IT providers, cloud-based AI and machine learning represents a new frontier that promises to offer fresh opportunities as the market catches on to the technology. But it also requires a host of new skills and capabilities for partners to make the most of it. For Rod Bryan, lead partner of KPMG Australia’s cognitive and AI business division, Solution 49x – which partners heavily with IBM for its Watson cognitive capabilities – it’s still early days for the technology. “I think we’re at the beginning of a totally revolutionary timeframe,” Bryan said. “These technologies are so fundamental to the way organisations need to change, and some of the change will be good; it introduces efficiencies and capabilities we could only dream of a number of years ago.” While Bryan concedes that many industries are still coming to grips with the impact of the intelligent cloud, and that its uptake is likely to lead to some social disruption, it’s growing quickly. This serves as encouraging news for partners in a position to tackle this new technology, but a new approach may need to be adopted. “It’s different to a typical IT or system integration implementation,” Bryan said. “This is more of a business transformation where IT is a true partner rather than an owner. “And the reason it has to be that way is because these implementations are not like the fundamental provision of a core capability, like a billing system or a CRM system.” At present, many intelligent cloud projects begin life as a proof-of-concept or an experimental trial. They often end that way, too, according to Bryan. The trick is in proving its value. “The biggest challenge is in bringing the required skill-sets together to move it [the project] from trial into production in a way that demonstrates the robustness that any good IT shop and its business partners would expect.” Going deep The likelihood that a project drawing upon cloud- based AI or machine learning will make it only as far as a proof-of-concept trial has, until recently, remained relatively high for Daryl Wilding-McBride, chief technology officer of AWS partner, DiUS.

Product awareness, product interest, product evaluation, product trial and product adoption - the five stages of cloud acceptance have already been negotiated. With Australian organisations now on board and now investing, cloud has moved past the hype and into the mainstream, creating new opportunities for partners as a result. Whether it be public, private or hybrid, implementations will continue to accelerate in 2017 as end-users seek to take advantage of the cloud’s economies of scale to build core applications. But as cloud becomes default, a default cloud channel strategy still ceases to exist. In association with Exclusive Networks, Fortinet, Storagecraft, Veeam, Westcon-Comstor and Zerto, this exclusive ARN roundtable assessed how partners can profit amidst a seemingly lucrative cloud world, outlining the new technologies coming to play, and the strategies required for ongoing success.

Reuters/Ruben Sprich If latest reports are to be believed, Google has recently delayed the release of its highly-anticipated Nexus 7 2017 tablet. The company is said to be improving on the features of the device. While some sources say that the Nexus 2017 tablet will run on the Andromeda operating system, certain others say that the Android 7.0 Nougat OS will be the one it will be running on. Earlier reports were saying that the two operating systems will be merged but that seems unlikely. However, having two operating systems in one device may confuse buyers. Google’s head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer, said that Android and Chrome will never merge as that would not make sense at all. According to a December 2016 report by Chrome Unboxed, Hiroshi talked about trial and error methods to ascertain which operating system will fit the best. He further stated that “cross-pollination” is possible but not a merge. However, experts now believe that the Google Nexus 7 2017 tablet may finally go with the Android 7.0 Nougat OS. There are conflicting views as regards the specs and features of the Nexus 7 2017 tablet. The tablet is expected to have a 7-inch AMOLED display with 2,560 x 1,440 pixels screen resolution. The tablet is said to be powered by a 4GB RAM and have 64GB of internal storage. One reason why fans are eagerly waiting for the tablet is because Google had said earlier that it will be focusing a lot on both smartphones and tablets. This had led many to believe that the tablet is very much in the works. The search giant may not be producing Pixel laptops anymore. Fans are expecting at least a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, though rumours point towards a Snapdragon 820 chipset. Meanwhile, Samsung is said to be targeting business professionals via its Galaxy Book. It is a tablet that is said to be a direct replacement for a laptop. It runs on the Windows 10 OS. The keyboard and stylus are part of the bundle. The Super AMOLED screen is now the talking point of the device. The Samsung Galaxy Book has a display resolution of 2,160 x 1,440 pixels and 216ppi. The upgraded S Pen is battery-free and included in the box. There is a 4GB and 8GB RAM option and a seventh-generation Intel core i5 chipset. The tablet is available in standard wi-fi and wi-fi + LTE variants. USB Type-C ports have been included in the device.

And, not before time, it is telling the internet behemoths: clean up your act. Over the past few days, advertising companies representing the country’s biggest consumer brands and banks have suspended their contracts with Google, as it has become clear the company has failed to prevent those advertisements attaching to disgusting videos preaching race hatred and virulent anti-Semitism. The BBC has also found itself unwittingly linked commercially (via its advertising contract with Google) to some of the most poisonous people on the planet. BBC programmes including The Last Kingdom were promoted via Google on videos posted by Wagdy Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from this country for inciting hatred. The BBC has also found itself unwittingly linked commercially (via its advertising contract with Google) to some of the most poisonous people on the planet.  An advert for the BBC show the Last Kingdom was played before a video of neo Nazis National Rebirth of Poland This has been good business for Google — it meets its commitment to advertisers to attract more ‘clicks’ — and good business for the likes of Mr Ghoneim, who receives his share of the commission. Be clear, though, what this means. It means that you, as a BBC licence-fee payer, are unwittingly funding those who want to destroy Western civilisation. Similarly, public information adverts paid for by the British taxpayer have popped up on such websites. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Now M&S boycotts Google: Web giant faces growing storm of...

Share this article Share 127 shares Last week, a government spokesman said: ‘It is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate content. That message was conveyed very clearly to Google.’ Luridly Google claimed it removed nearly two billion ‘bad ads’ last year and prevented adverts on more than 300 million YouTube videos. YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion in 2006, and since then has more than paid that back in advertising revenues. However, an investigation by The Times has laid bare the company’s true negligence — or insouciance. Dominic Lawson says that Mark Zuckerberg wants the power of being the planet’s biggest publisher, without any of the responsibilities It revealed that YouTube failed to remove six luridly anti-Semitic videos — even after the paper reported it to them — within the 24 hours mandated by EU regulations. The German government has now threatened to fine firms such as YouTube and Google up to £40 million for breaches of its laws about hate speech. (Holocaust denial is illegal in Germany and punishable by imprisonment.) Facebook, meanwhile, is now the world’s largest media company. But its founder Mark Zuckerberg continues with the convenient pretence that it’s just a technology business. This man with a personal fortune of more than $55 billion wants to enjoy the power of being the planet’s biggest publisher, without any of the responsibilities traditionally assumed by reputable publishers. In effect, he has found a uniquely profitable means to monetise pornography and vile abuse, while evading legal and regulatory sanctions. If a defamatory statement appears in the Mail, this newspaper is liable as publisher for any damages a successful plaintiff gains through litigation; but these giant publishers of the worldwide web take the (vast) profits with none of the risks. Alternatively, the internet companies say their relationship with the material published on their sites is more akin to the Post Office’s relationship with the letters sent round the country: that they are merely enabling distribution and cannot be held responsible for the contents.     More from Dominic Lawson for the Daily Mail...   DOMINIC LAWSON: Going organic isn't healthier, harms the planet - and put me in hospital for a week 13/03/17   DOMINIC LAWSON: The depressing real reason police have stopped cracking down on aggressive morons on bikes  06/03/17   Disloyal.

The Post Office gains its revenue just from distribution. But companies such as Facebook and YouTube say to businesses: ‘We have a wonderful system which directs your ads to the right viewers, to promote your brands.’ So when it suits them to say that what they do involves targeting ads in a precise fashion, they do so — and make countless billions of dollars in profit from this (at the expense of traditional media companies such as TV stations and newspapers, which take full responsibility for what they present to the public). The other claim — made by Facebook — is that it is impossible for them to spot more than a small minority of the worst videos and posts themselves, because the sheer volume of material submitted rules out more than cursory invigilation. In fact, Facebook does have a motley team of ‘moderators’, as was revealed in an investigation by the website Gawker. But checking is outsourced to countries such as Morocco, the Philippines and Mexico. According to one such Moroccan moderator, who supplied his terms and conditions to Gawker, these people are paid little more than $1 a hour. A pittance for what one such contractor described as ‘All the mess/dirt/waste/s*** of the world flow towards you and you have to clean it.’ Misery Not that well cleaned, one might add: but Facebook hardly sets high standards. Its advice to those poor $1-an-hour moderators includes the following guideline: ‘Crushed heads, limbs etc are OK as long as no insides are showing.’ Lovely. Facebook is now being sued in Northern Ireland by the family of a girl of 14 after compromising pictures of her were posted and re-posted by someone determined to cause her misery. The company insisted it could only react when her family found out and complained: that it was not able itself to identify and block the re-publication of the image from another account. Yet as long as four years ago, Facebook’s policy director, Simon Milner, told a House of Commons committee investigating the social media: ‘We use photo DNA, a piece of technology created by Microsoft and we use it to scan every photo uploaded to Facebook.’ But if every photo has its own ‘DNA’ — as unique as a fingerprint — it suggests Facebook can easily know whenever an abusive image it has previously pulled pops up again. In other words, companies such as Facebook and Google have the technology — and, God knows, the money — to do a vastly better job in cleaning up the internet. What they don’t like is that it will involve extra costs and reduce revenues. But if they don’t do it now, they will find it being done to them.   Islanders' dark secrets must never be forgotten  Heroine: Louisa Gould, who sheltered a Russian PoW while Jersey was occupied by the Germans and died in the gas chambers after she was discovered Forget the impenetrable and inaudible fantasy of SS-GB, the Nazi drama on BBC1. Another Mother’s Son, opening this week, is a film based on the unarguably true story of Louisa Gould. This was the woman who, when the Channel Islands were under German occupation between 1940 and 1945, sheltered an escaped Russian prisoner of war. Gould was betrayed by a neighbour and deported to the concentration camps: she died in the gas chamber of Ravensbruck. This film will bring back terrible memories for some Channel Islanders who remember the German occupation. Full-scale resistance was out of the question: the Wehrmacht were there in force, while the islanders were unarmed and had been abandoned by the British Government. But uneasy questions remain. The rate of illegitimate births soared, the result of what might be described as wholesale intimate fraternisation with the occupier. And the authorities on the islands were assiduous in handing over the names and addresses of the handful of remaining Jewish residents to the Nazis — all of whom perished. They justified this on the grounds that any dissent would cause more trouble than it was worth. But the same people protested strongly at the Nazis’ strictures against Freemasonry — because many of the islands’ leading families were themselves masons. Victor Carey, the then bailiff of Guernsey, was the most obsequious of those authorities. He publicly referred to the Allied Forces as ‘the Enemy’ and offered a £25 reward to any islanders who informed on resisters. Remarkably, Carey was knighted by George VI within months of the liberation of the Channel Islands. Many in British intelligence thought Carey should have been executed for treason, not honoured. Westminster, though, decided it was better to pretend everyone on the islands had been a hero. But no one talked about Louisa Gould.

What makes this phishing tactic more effective is that it looks like it came from a trusted source. According to Robert Hackett of Fortune.com, “The attacker, usually disguised as a trusted contact, sends a booby-trapped email to a prospective victim.” The email appears to come from a friend on business associate. In reality, the account of the source has already been hi-jacked to perpetuate the scam. Victims have reported receiving an email with a fake PDF invoice attachment. When the victim clicks on the attachment, they are sent to what looks like a Google log-in page. The spoofed Google page is crafted to look just like the true log in page. From there victims are urged to enter their log in credentials to “view” the invoice. The reality: There is no invoice. Scammers are just looking for your login id and password. Once they have that, scammers will access your contacts and send out the same phishing email to them. The goal of this scam is to harvest as many login credentials as possible to 1) steal the identities of victims or 2) sell the information on the black market. Credentials of this nature are very valuable. Why are so many people still falling for this type of scam, even though it’s been around for a long time? Scammers are becoming savvier and technically proficient at spoofing the exact look and function of legitimate websites, to the point that 97% Of People Globally Unable to Correctly Identify Phishing Emails, according to a McAfee for Business study. How to safeguard yourself against this scam? Be very skeptical of email attachments, even if they appear to come from a trusted source. If you receive and email like the one described above – an invoice for something you did not authorize – don’t click on the link. If you are ever re-directed from an attachment to sign into Google or any other account, don’t do it. To verify the information in the email, log in to your account using a bookmarked link rather than the re-direct or a link provided in the email. If you believe your Gmail account has already been compromised, contact Google directly. For more tips from Google on how to keep your accounts secure, go to the Google Safety Center. To read more about this new Gmail Phishing Scam, go to Everyone Is Falling for This Frighteningly Effective Gmail Scam.

 Gmail app gets P2P upgrade BI Intelligence Mar. 16, 2017, 10:43 AM 1,767 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also THE MOBILE PAYMENTS IN CHINA REPORT: What the US can learn from China's enormous success in mobile payments Google and Facebook are tightening their stranglehold on the digital ad market You won’t recognize the new world of digital payments without this report This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google is extending its previous support of peer-to-peer (P2P) payments for desktop users to the Gmail mobile app, according to Finextra. Four years after the feature was first enabled on desktop (2013), the mobile upgrade will let Android phone owners easily send money to their email contacts without leaving the email app. The feature is not yet available on iOS. Previously, they would have to open a separate mobile P2P app, such as Google Wallet or a competitor like Square Cash, to send a payment to an email contact. A couple of factors stand out about Google’s Gmail app upgrade. This is a slow transition to mobile for a digital titan. It is surprising that Google, which has been a leader in pioneering mobile ad sales alongside Facebook, would wait four years before determining mobile email users should have the same payments abilities as those online. While Google Wallet has been available for three of those years, since 2014, users had to leave their email app to transfer funds to contacts. WeChat Pay, the Chinese messaging-meets-P2P service, has shown that bridging communication with payments can have a tremendous effect – BI Intelligence estimates up to $299 billion was spent through the application in 2016 alone.  It begs revisiting Google’s split digital payments branding strategy. Google has two tools its users think of when they want to make payment: Android Pay (in-store, in-app, online payments) and Google Wallet (online and mobile P2P). As a brand, Google Wallet has a history that may further confuse users ­– it originally conducted mobile in-store payments, failed to catch on, and was later replaced by Android Pay. Consolidating all money movement capabilities under one brand could clear up confusion to users, and align marketing strategies for the two services. While the timing and execution of Google’s email payments upgrade could raise eyebrows, it is ultimately an encouraging progression for the company. Mobile P2P is rising — BI Intelligence forecasts that US mobile P2P volume will grow to $336 billion in 2021, up from $19 billion in 2015 — and adding Gmail app integration gives users one more way to pay with their phones, which could ultimately grow Google Wallet's volume. The move also represents Google thinking about new ways to differentiate the payments experience, in this case by connecting to mobile messaging environments. Continuing to experiment with new ingredients in the P2P payments formula – be that messaging, social network integration, or combining all of their other payment types (e.g., in-app, in-store, in-browser, or P2P) ­­– will allow Google stand out in a sea of competition.  Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, defined as informal payments made from one person to another, have long been a prominent feature of the payments industry. That’s because individuals transfer funds to each other on a regular basis, whether it's to make a recurring payment, reimburse a friend, or split a dinner bill.   Cash and checks have historically dominated the P2P ecosystem, and they’re still a popular tool. But as smartphones become a primary computing device, top digital platforms, like Venmo and Google Wallet, have enabled customers to turn away from cash and make those payments digitally with ease. Over the next few years, though overall P2P spend will remain constant, a shift to mobile payments across the board and increased spending power from the digital-savvy younger generation will cause the mobile P2P industry to skyrocket.  That poses a problem for firms providing these services, though. Historically, most of these players have taken on mobile P2P at a loss because it’s a low-friction way to onboard users and won’t catch on unless it’s free, or largely free, to consumers. But as it becomes more popular and starts to eat into these firms’ traditional streams of revenue, finding ways to monetize is increasingly important. That could mean moving P2P functionality into more profitable environments, leveraging existing networks of friends to encourage spending, or offering value-added services at a nominal fee. Jaime Toplin, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile P2P payments that examines what’s driving this shift to mobile P2P and explains why companies need to find a way to capitalize on it quickly. It discusses how firms can use the tools they have to gain in the P2P space, details several cases, and evaluates which strategies might be the most effective in monetizing these platforms. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Consumers still want mobile P2P services, and they’re turning to them. Individuals pay their peers on a regular basis, and as smartphones are increasingly used as computing devices, these consumers look to such services for fast and easy ways to pay.  Monetizing P2P is more important than ever. Initially, P2P was a valuable onboarding tool for companies, and when it was still a small segment, taking it on at little value or a loss didn’t have major implications. But as volume grows and user bases scale fast, finding ways to monetize quickly should be a priority for firms looking to stay ahead. New technology could put some apps ahead of their peers. P2P continues to rely on networks, especially for informal, social transactions. But rather than having a large network, it’s becoming important for firms to understand their user bases and the networks within them. This means that chat apps, and leveraging bot and AI technology, may offer a distinct advantage. In full, the report: Forecasts the growth of the P2P market, and what portion of that will come from mobile channels, through 2021. Explains the factors driving that growth and details why it will come from increased usage, not increased spend per user. Evaluates why mobile P2P isn’t profitable for companies, and details several cases of attempts to monetize. Assesses which of these strategies could be most successful, and what companies need to leverage to succeed in the space.

The high street chain became the latest in a string of household names to suspend its marketing on the site because of concerns adverts are inadvertently funding terror groups. Ministers last night faced demands to take action against the internet giant after the Mail found neo-Nazi videos remained on YouTube despite repeated warnings. Vile: Masked figures marching in a recruitment video for the banned far-Right National Action, which has only just been taken down from YouTube Fears about Google’s political influence also mounted after it emerged the firm’s bosses have met ministers at least once a month since the 2015 general election. M&S yesterday followed HSBC, Lloyds, RBS, McDonald’s, L’Oreal, Audi, the BBC, O2, the Royal Mail and Domino’s in pulling its advertising from YouTube. Waitrose, Barclays, Vodafone and Sky are understood to be considering similar action. YouTube hands £6.15 of advertising revenue for every 1,000 views to those who post videos, meaning household names have unintentionally been funnelling cash to terror groups, neo-Nazis and homophobes. Many videos generate millions of hits. In a bid to halt the advertising exodus, Google has admitted it ‘can and must do more’, and has promised to make changes ‘in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Advertising agency with Royal Mail and O2 as clients says... Shame on you, Facebook: How your child was just 3 clicks... Share this article Share But an M&S spokesman said yesterday: ‘In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through.’ Google does not actively look for hate content on YouTube, instead waiting for users to flag it up. This has enraged many firms, which have found their brands promoted alongside terrorist videos. The advertising boycott comes as the close links that Google has built with the top of Government are revealed today. Theresa May, David Cameron and Culture Secretary Karen Bradley are among 13 ministers who have held dozens of meetings with the internet giant since the election. The extent of the cosy relationship between Google and Whitehall will spark fresh concerns over the scale of the firm’s political clout. In the 17 months between May 2015 and September last year, ministers held at least 27 meetings with the web company. Data for the past six months has yet to be published. Marks and Spencer last night pulled its advertising from Google’s YouTube as part of a growing boycott over its failure to remove extremist content Mrs May met Google in July 2015, when she was home secretary, while the firm attended a business roundtable with then prime minister Mr Cameron that October. Internet safety minister Baroness Shields – a former Google managing director – met with her old firm seven times, which included discussions on online extremism. Baroness Shields, who was made a peer by Mr Cameron, is one of dozens of Google executives who have been through a ‘revolving door’ between the tech company and Government.The firm has hired at least 26 Whitehall staff, including No 10 aides, in the past decade. Its staff have also headed in the oopposite direction. Nigel Huddleston left his job as the search engine’s industry head of travel after being elected as a Tory MP in 2015. Rachel Whetstone, a former aide to ex-Tory leader Michael Howard – and friend of Mr Cameron – later worked for Google as head of international communications. She is also married to the former PM’s ex-strategist, Steve Hilton. We must do more to give brands more control over where their ads appear  The Tories lavished £312,000 on Google ads in the run-up to the election. Google chairman Eric Schmidt spent five years as a business adviser to Mr Cameron and previously gave the keynote speech at the Tory conference. According to marketing experts, extremists have made £250,000 from adverts for household brands and public bodies hosted on Google. The search giant has earned around £120,000. One of the biggest earning hate preachers is the Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghoneim, who is banned from visiting the UK. His YouTube channel has netted him around £65,000. The boycott of YouTube started on Friday, when ministers suspended all government advertising on the video- sharing platform until it could all but guarantee public money would not fund hate content. Officials learned that adverts for public bodies such as UK Aid and the Metropolitan Police had been running alongside YouTube videos containing extremist material.   Hate videos still appear on YouTube after MPs' warnings  Google failed to take down neo-Nazi videos from YouTube despite repeated warnings, prompting MPs to demand that the Government takes action against the internet giant. Recruitment videos for banned far-Right group National Action remained on the site until last night despite a promise by Google to remove its offensive material. While they were finally taken down after the Daily Mail contacted Google, other offensive films, including one showing how to tie a hangman’s noose, remain online. Alarming: A video on how to tie a noose, viewed more than 700,000 times, yet Google has refused to take it down because it is 'instructional'  One National Action film, which included details on how to join the racist movement, said: ‘Will you fight for your people? We will not stop until the alien has been driven out. ‘Remember stranger whose land you are in, because there are men and women who will fight to keep it pure. Britain is ours, the rest must go.’ In a second video, the group said: ‘We continue the battle for the final victory of our race.’ PRIVACY FEARS OVER NHS DEALS Google has struck up deals with four NHS hospitals to share the data of millions of patients. The hospitals concerned are in London. The contracts are with Google’s artificial intelligence firm DeepMind, which is using technology to improve treatment of certain conditions. Plans include developing an app to diagnose a potentially fatal kidney condition, and advanced radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. The most controversial contracts involve the Royal Free and Imperial College Healthcare, where millions of files have been handed over to DeepMind without patients’ knowledge in a move privacy campaigners say is ‘inexcusable’. The deal with the Royal Free, struck up in 2015, is still being investigated by the Information Commissioner’s Office over possible breaches of privacy. Phil Booth, of medConfidential, said: ‘DeepMind claims their deal with the Royal Free and Imperial is a direct care project ... yet they continuously fail to answer any privacy or transparency questions. ‘Mistakes were made, and the only people who refuse to admit error are Google.’ DeepMind said they ‘strongly contest’ allegations that the deals were ‘inexcusable’. On Tuesday Google chiefs assured the home affairs committee they would work harder to remove offensive material and agreed content by National Action should be taken down. But committee chairman Yvette Cooper wrote to the firm on Friday after the group’s videos remained available. She wrote: ‘The committee should not have to make further complaints to you to ensure that all videos from this proscribed organisation are now properly removed.’ Last night after the Mail found two National Action clips were still accessible, Miss Cooper said she would ask Home Office minister Sarah Newton and Solicitor General Robert Buckland to take action against the firm in a committee hearing tomorrow. Miss Cooper said: ‘How many times does this need to be raised with them before Google get their act together?’ National Action became the first far-Right group to be banned under terrorism laws in December by Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who described it as a ‘racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic organisation that glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideology’. In her letter to Google vice president Peter Barron on Friday, Miss Cooper said it was ‘astonishing’ the firm had not removed the content, adding: ‘The lack of social responsibility Google is showing towards hate crime on YouTube is extremely troubling.’ The two National Action videos were last night finally taken down. A Google spokesman said: ‘We have clear policies against inciting violence or hatred and remove content that is illegal or breaks our rules when made aware of it.’ But other clips were found on YouTube showing images relating to self-harm, eating disorders and suicide. Google removed some of the content when alerted by the Mail, but refused to take down a video, which has been watched more than 700,000 times, demonstrating how to tie a hangman’s noose because it was ‘instructional’. Alarmingly, dozens of users commented on the video claiming they intended to use it to commit suicide. Stephen Buckley, of mental health charity Mind, said it is ‘vital to recognise the huge danger’ of websites promoting self-harm, suicide and eating disorders.

The U.S. company said in a blog post Friday it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France’s Havas SA, the world’s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its U.K. clients’ ads from Google and YouTube on Friday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads wouldn’t appear next to offensive material. Those clients include wireless carrier O2, Royal Mail Plc, government-owned British Broadcasting Corp., Domino’s Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said in a statement. “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect,” said Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside the U.K., and called its U.K. unit’s decision “a temporary move.” “The Havas Group will not be undertaking such measures on a global basis,” a Havas spokeswoman wrote in an email. “We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the U.K.” The decision to pull ads from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the U.K. government appeared alongside content from the likes of white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who praised the killing of 49 people in a gay nightclub. Google made $7.8 billion in advertising revenue in the U.K. in 2016, accounting for 8.6 percent of the company’s total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Online Clash Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook Inc., claiming the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. The controversy about ads appearing in inappropriate contexts may give these media buyers leverage in negotiations with the social media giants. Martin Sorrell, the founder and chief executive officer of WPP, the global advertising firm, said in a statement that Google and Facebook have “the same responsibilities as any media company” and could not “masquerade” as mere technology platforms. He said WPP’s GroupM, a major ad buyer, was talking to Google “at the highest levels to encourage them to find answers to these brand safety issues.” Ronan Harris, Google’s U.K. managing director, said in the blog post that Google removed nearly 2 billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from the company’s ad sense program. Despite this, Harris wrote, “we don’t always get it right.” Harris said Google had “heard from our advertisers loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content.” Policy Review The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes “in the coming weeks” to help customers stop their ads appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Harris said. Ads appeared “next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” prompting Guardian News & Media to stop all advertising through YouTube parent Google, the British publisher said in an emailed statement Friday. The U.K. government said it suspended advertising on YouTube until the site can ensure they’re not placed next to content it doesn’t approve of. “Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content,” the U.K. government said in an emailed statement. “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way.” Britain, Germany Britain’s government said it summoned Google for discussions to explain how it can guarantee the state’s demands are met, while on Tuesday Germany threatened to fine social networks such as Facebook as much as 50 million euros ($53 million) if they fail to give users the option to complain about hate speech and fake news or refuse to remove illegal content. British supermarket chain J Sainsbury Plc., whose ads appeared on videos posted by the white nationalist Polish Defence League, said it and its sister brand Argos would immediately suspend all Google advertising. “It is unacceptable that Google is allowing our ads to be placed alongside these videos on YouTube,” the company said in an emailed statement. It said it was seeking “urgent assurances” from Google that the problems were being addressed. The Guardian said it would be withdrawing its advertising until Google could provide guarantees that the ad misplacement wouldn’t happen in future. “It is completely unacceptable that Google allows advertising for brands like the Guardian to appear next to extremist and hate-filled videos,” Guardian News & Media said. L’Oreal, the cosmetics brand, said it was unaware that ads it was running in connection with the Prince’s Trust, a charity founded by Prince Charles that helps train disadvantaged young people for work, were appearing on YouTube channels associated with extremists. “We are horrified that our campaign — which is the total antithesis of this extreme, negative content — could be seen in connection with them,” the company said in a statement. L’Oreal said it planned to work more closely with Google to make sure it didn’t happen again.

On Friday, the UK government was the most high-profile advertiser to air criticism of the internet giant's brand safety efforts. Transport for London and the Financial Conduct Authority were among other public agencies suspending their advertising, along with media owners Channel 4 and the Guardian, and L'Oréal, the haircare brand, Campaign reported. "Google is responsible for ensuring the high standards applied to government advertising are adhered to and that adverts do not appear alongside inappropriate content," the UK government said in an emailed statement. "We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way." A similar message was delivered by the Guardian: "It is completely unacceptable that Google allows advertising for brands like the Guardian to appear next to extremist and hate-filled videos," Guardian News & Media said. Media agency Havas also said on Friday it was stopping spending with Google and YouTube having failed to received satisfactory assurances that video and display content would be classified quickly enough and with the correct filters. Over the weekend broadcaster Sky, mobile operator Vodafone and three banks, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS, followed suit. Ronan Harris, managing director, Google UK, responded in blog post: "We've heard from our advertisers and agencies loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content. "We've begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network." The ISBA suggested that Google could start by reviewing the practice of placing advertising immediately against newly-uploaded YouTube content, before it has been classified, while the IPA reported that it has been fast-tracking discussions in the area of brand safety, "particularly with Google". Both bodies are members of JICWEBS (Joint Industry Committee for Web Standards), and only last week the IPA coordinated a mass multi-buying point email to online inventory suppliers about JICWEBS' brand safety compliance which it said had led to many more signing up.

Name: Subject: Message: 15 best Google Daydream games Apps & Gamesby Joe Hindy4 days ago 1 182 8 Google Daydream is Google’s big push into VR. There are only a handful of devices that can use it. On top of that, there simply aren’t a lot of apps or games out for the platform. However, some are starting to push through. We’ll update this as more stuff comes out, but for now, here are the best Google Daydream games! Looking for more VR games and apps? Try these!   15 best VR games for Google Cardboard1 week ago   10 best VR apps for Google Cardboard1 week ago Bait Price: $7.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Bait is a fishing game for Daydream. It provides a calm, relaxing environment where you can catch fish. The mechanics are simple enough to grasp. It really feels like the developers focused more on the overall experience rather than challenge of complexity. Your main goal is to catch as many fish as possible. There are also people nearby to talk to. There are five different lakes to fish, each with its own lineup of fish to catch. It's a bit pricey at $7.99, but fishing fans should feel right at home. There are also no in-app purchases. It's one of the better Daydream games. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Bandit Six Price: $2.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Bandix Six is a airborne shooter. The theme of the game is World War II. You'll be put in the gunner seat and your job is to shoot down as many bad guys as possible. There are 30 missions to play through. You'll also be fighting against (mostly) historically accurate planes from that era. It's a great VR experience. Some have complained about the controls, but those are mostly minor. Otherwise, it's one of the more enjoyable Daydream games out there. It's $2.99 with no in-app purchases. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Battle Planet Price: $10.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Battle Planet is a VR action shooter. The basic premise is that you'll be defending a micro planet from a nearly endless onslaught of bad guys. You'll be armed with a gun along with a robot. The robot helps defuse bombs. It features tons of bad guys, boss fights, and various power weapons and upgrades. You lose the game if your planet explodes. It's one of the most expensive Daydream games at $10.99, but those who have tried it have had only good things to say so far. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Claro Price: $4.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Claro is an atmospheric puzzle game. Your job is to move the sun around in order to help the plants in the level grow. There are 38 levels in total, including an expansion from last December. Each level has its own set of challenges to help keep you engaged. It won't make your pulse race or anything like that. Its main goal is to help you relax while you figure out the puzzle. That means it's also family friendly. It's relatively inexpensive and there are no in-app purchases. It's one of the must-have Google Daydream games. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Damnfields Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Damnfields is a tough little puzzle game. Your goal is to move the dot around each level without falling off of the edge. It uses Daydream's head movement controls. That means you'll be looking around with more precision than you're used to. There are over 30 levels, five game modes, and more. Four of the game modes have timers to add a bit of challenge. There is some light swearing, but otherwise it's a clean little game. It's also one of the few really good free Daydream games that isn't just a demo. Give it a shot! DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Or try out some augmented reality apps and games as well!   10 best augmented reality games and AR games for Android2 weeks ago   10 best augmented reality apps and AR apps for Android2 weeks ago Horizons Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Horizons is a VR rhythm game. You use the Daydream controller to control the music. The music you play controls the massive void of colors that you see. It's an enjoyable visual and audio experience. The developers heavily recommend using headphones to get the most immersive experience. Some have experience some bugs. However, it is an entirely free game so it's easy to look passed them. On the downside, it's not one of the more complex Daydream games out there. It's really good for a bit, but eventually you'll want something more. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Hunters Gate Price: $5.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Hunters Gate is a third person shooter for Daydream. Your goal will be to defend yourself from a demon invasion. You'll have a choice between two characters (Forge and Payne). You'll have various things to upgrade and power up to help you survive as long as possible. Perhaps the best feature is its local multiplayer mode. You can play with a friend over your WiFi connection and take on the horde together. It's $5.99, but there are no in-app purchases. It's one of the better Daydream games for households with multiple devices. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Price: $9.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a cooperative puzzle game. It's also one of the best multiplayer Daydream games out there. One player will try to diffuse the bomb. The other players will have documents they have to sift through in order to give the proper instructions on making the bomb not blow up. It's challenging and a lot of fun when you have a bunch of players. The only downside is that's rather expensive. However, those who have played the game will tell you that it's worth it. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Need for Speed No Limits VR Price: $7.49 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Need for Speed No Limits VR is a racing game, but most of you knew that. It puts you in the driver's seat as you race. The game tries to make the experience as realistic and intense as possible. It does a pretty decent job. You'll have various tracks and cars to play with. You can also customize your ride outside of racing. It works well most of the time, but several players have noticed some bugs. If you decide to try it out, give it a good test quickly in case you need to refund it. It's a good experience most of the time. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Twilight Pioneers Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Twilight Pioneers is an action RPG game. In fact, it was the only one we could find for Google Daydream. It's a first-person ARPG that uses Daydream's head tracking to let you look around and beat up bad guys. It includes boss fights, a story line, and your usual array of RPG elements. There are some character customizations as well, although not many. The mechanics are simple so as not to confuse you much while playing. It's also a free download and probably among the best free Daydream games. Give it a shot. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Here are some more excellent games for other Google devices   10 best Android Wear gamesJanuary 1, 2017   15 best Android TV gamesJuly 22, 2016 Untethered Price: $4.99 / $2.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Untethered is one of the more unique Daydream games. It's an episodic radio drama with a little mystery evolved. You'll get to investigate a series of phenomenons. You'll be taking calls, talking to people, and going to locations to find clues. Each new episode will add to the story, locations, and people that you can talk to. It's actually very well done. The main game costs $4.99 and each new episode will run you $2.99. The developers do warn that using Bluetooth headphones with this game can cause some issues. It's nothing major, just something to keep in mind. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Virush Price: $2.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Virush is an arcade game with a lot going for it. The basic idea is that you're battling computer viruses. In reality, it's essentially an arcade shooter with some bright colors and fun ideas. It's a good game to see what VR is really capable of. You'll need the head tracking to see everything and the controller will be used to take it down. Otherwise, it's a simple arcade game without too many frills. It's $2.99 with no in-app purchases if you're interested. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY VR Karts Price: Free / $4.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY VR Karts is the Google Daydream equivalent of Mario Kart. You'll be driving a go kart around various tracks. You'll also be picking up weapons and using them to keep the other racers for winning. There is a single player mode, an online multiplayer mode, and a championship mode. It's a ton of fun and you can even customize your kart. However, it is experiencing a few performance issues. It was also bogged down by a save file problem although that one has been fixed. It's one of the must-have Daydream games. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Wonderglade Price: Free / $3.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Wonderglade is a beautifully done VR game for Google Daydream. It takes place in a theme park and it's actually a bunch of mini-games packaged into one. The games are a mix of puzzle, racing, and arcade style games. There is even a mini-golf game. As you play, you'll earn tickets that you can use to unlock items to re-use in the mini-games. It's nothing super deep or complex. However, it's a good little collection of games to kill an afternoon. It's free to download and check out. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Wands Price: $5.99 DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Wands is an online multiplayer game where you duel with magic. You'll be given a wand and you imbue with various magic spells. You then take your spells to battle against other online players. You'll unlock new spells to use as you progress and you can even watch other people battle as well. There is even a little workshop where you can practice and tinker with your stuff between battles. It's a fun little online game. $5.99 is a bit expensive, but there are no in-app purchases. Totally worth it. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Thank you for reading!

The latest was a major December update aimed at improving the game. There’s plenty to love about the latest changes, but it’s also causing problems for some. Here we’ll explain how to fix the “Device is not compatible” error while trying to update Clash of Clans on Android. Additionally, we have more details about Google accounts not syncing correctly for saved villages. It’s one of the most popular titles on Android and iOS. Millions of people play it daily. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this error message, but recently it has been happening more frequently. Most other issues can be fixed with the instructions below. Read: Clash of Clans Updates: 7 Things We Want Next The last update added tons of level 11 troops, cheaper costs and other things. However, it also added some problems. In fact, some can’t update the game at all. As a result it can’t be played. This is a big issue, and hopefully the few suggestions below can help. If you haven’t updated you’ll see a notification upon launching the game that an update is available. You cannot play until you accept this, go to the Google Play Store, and update to the latest version of the game. Everything is fine for those on iOS, but Android users are being met with a very odd problem. Users are getting an error on the Google Play Store for Clash of Clans that says, “Device is not compatible with this version” and are unable to update. Supercell confirmed this is a problem, and has offered up a fix for those having issues. Players affected by "Your device is not compatible with this version", please try: Settings >App Manager>Google Play Store>Clear data/cache — Clash of Clans (@ClashofClans) January 26, 2016 If you can’t update, you can’t play. Some are even in an active Clan War and can’t update in order to fight before time runs out. Which as many can imagine, would be very frustrating. Update: On February 26th Supercell made some changes and had another small maintenance break to fix the device incompatible and other Google services issues. Let us know in the comments below if the problem is still going on. Update #2: On March 4th Supercell finally fixed the Google Play Store device not compatible Clash of Clans problem, as well as the Google Games ID and sync issue many users have been experiencing. According to them, those who were unable to sync their Google Games account to restore or save a village, and the thousands of users who couldn’t update, should all be able to download the latest update from the Google Play Store release late last night and this morning. Head into the Play Store, check for updates, and download it right now to get back to Clashing. Update #3: The new December Clash of Clans update made this issue appear again. Users have also experienced crashes while in global chat, chat logs being out of order and other small things. Supercell may release another optional update to fix this. Even people that have been using the same device for well over a year are having issues. We’re seeing reports all over Twitter that people with tablets, the LG G3, Galaxy S6 and other devices are all experiencing this error. I’ve updated a Galaxy S7, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet and Nexus 9 all without any problems. So we’re not sure what is causing this at the moment, or what Android devices are experiencing it. been playing #COC on the same phone for 3 months and today its telling me that my device is not compatible with this version @ClashofClans — EllisWard✌️ (@fan_paige_wwe) January 26, 2016 If you are trying to update Clash of Clans on an Android device but running into problems, there are a few potential fixes. There is either something messed up with the Google Play Store, or something Supercell did. They’re blaming it on the Google Play, and suggest users clear the Store cache or data to resolve it. Above are basic instructions, but below are screenshots to help those experiencing issues. Instructions To fix the Clash of Clans update “your device is not compatible with this version” error message, try clearing the Google Play Store cache, and then data. Next, restart the Google Play Store and accept the update again. Pull down the notification bar on your Android device and hit the gear-shaped settings icon, or find “settings” in the application tray. From here navigate to Apps, or App Manager. Next scroll down and find Google Play Store. Select this, and tap “Clear Cache or Data” as shown below. This should erase everything, and get rid of any corrupt files that seem to be causing this problem. Supercell claims this will fix the error. Multiple comments suggest it worked. Now go back and download the update. Other Options However, if this doesn’t solve the problem another option is to uninstall Clash of Clans and re-install it. Yes, that sounds scary, and no one wants to lose their entire village by uninstalling the game. You won’t. Obviously proceed at your own risk and use caution. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone If the game is backed up to Google+ or Google Games (an option in settings) your progress is saved. Meaning you can uninstall Clash, reinstall it, and restore your progress simply by going into settings and connecting to Google+, and it will restore your village in less than 10 seconds. However, if you never linked the two, this won’t work. So do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it’s backed up. The guide above goes over a few details regarding transferring the game to a new phone, which is also how you can save progress. That said, if you can’t open the game you can’t link it to Google Games. Do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it is saved. Conclusion This is a big problem. Supercell states that clearing the Google Play Store cache is your only option, and it should solve any issues. They’re currently looking into other options, and will offer up additional information if available. At the end of the day, did clearing the cache or data fix it for you? Let us know in the comments below. Those who fixed it using other methods, feel free to share it below. The December update was loaded with content and a Christmas theme. Expect a bug fixing update in 2017 along with removal of the winter theme. 240 Responses 01/26/2016 kim Reply No, it did not work for me.

Sims Reply Listen to the man or woman lol… Delete all data in “Google Play Store” & “Google Play Services” from your phones settings… this guaranteed to work (then go back to Google play store, accept terms. Then update the app)… from what I know it works with newer phones, if not you could be out of luck. 04/19/2016 ScottManJo Reply Finally got all my favorite Supercell games loaded onto my Galaxy Tab E Lite. Be sure to clear out the Cache & Date from the following 3 apps: Google Play Services, Google Play Store AND Google Play Games. I was able to get CoC & Boom Beach by clearing the first 2 but only could get Clash Royale after clearing Google Play Games. Hope this helps!

Very frustrating because I have been playing for over a year 04/24/2016 Emily Reply Same here, very frustrated and I can’t back it up as to is so I can’t uninstall and reinstall even if I could. 02/20/2016 Shaun Reply i am having this issue with needing a redeem code to even get on the play store now! 02/29/2016 Moaz Reply Thank you very much, it worked immedietly after i did these easy steps, am really grateful :-) thx again 03/20/2016 Logan Reply Didn’t work for me.

I have nothing to clear out. I don’t understand. 07/03/2016 wardojr Reply try updating play store service… 01/26/2016 sol goslin Reply No it diddnt work. I had hopes it would but no such luck. This sucks. I cant even get to the supercell customer service/help line. There may be other issues with this though. Im also noticing a significant drop in the speed of my device, so it may be something that either supercell got in its system, or someone hacked google and delivered a little viral surprise. If thats the case Im sure it will make itself known in a bigger than life fashion. Hopefully that isnt the case. Keep posting updates on what happens. A LOT of people are locked out of the game through this. 07/22/2016 Clara Icasiano Reply just uninstall in play games then install it again. Hope it works :) \ 01/26/2016 Tom Reply no…. 01/26/2016 Steve Reply Hi. I’m on an amazon fire tablet which doesnt support google+ so my game isn’t backed up.

I cleared all info/cache for Google play store, and I restarted the phone. Still says my Samsung S5 is not compatible. I have tried everything that has been suggested. This is very irritating. 07/01/2016 David Stumhofer Reply dude did you ever figure it out? 01/26/2016 Tom Reply I can help you all I just did it. Anyone who needs help email me at tom@gettyindustries.com 01/26/2016 Kyle Reply How did you do it? 01/26/2016 rick Reply did not work on my galaxy s5 01/27/2016 Robby Reply Hey I cleared my Google playstore cache and data 3 times and it finally worked.

This isn’t the first time and they always say the same fixes and is not working. He brought a new phone and 3_4 months , the same problem. And with their lack of customer service good luck on their emails telling you to contact them in the game. If not fixed soon I will retire my three accounts and so will my friend with four, and its sad seeing that we both spent over $150 on accounts each. 01/28/2016 Nathalie Blues Reply I have spent over $1300 and lead a clan where my friends have spent the same.

MUST SIGN CLASH OF CLANS INTO GOOGLE PLAY! go to settings→apps→clash of clans and then clear data (i know scarry). Then go to play store and my apps. Click “update all” and clash of clans will be on the list. Once it has updated, click on the clash of clans icon. It will load and come up with a new village. DONT CLICK ANYTHING YET!!! In the top left corner it says “sign in” click that and something will pop and start loading. Wait until it says “Would you like to laod Chief Whateveryournameis village? Click “yes” Clash of clans will restart loading up. Then your village is back!!! :-) 06/12/2016 Tadeusz Reply Thanks, man!

I cleared the cache in the store and game. That didn’t work. I uninstalled CoC. It didn’t show up in the Play Store. I went to Google Play Games app and was able to install from there.

My wife and I both have LG V410 tablets. They are both Android 5.0.2, same kernel versions, build numbers, etc. Hers works fine and had no issues at all. Mine is completely hosed. Tried updating, no dice. Tried Clearing the data and cache, same. Tried uninstalling\reinstalling, no longer able to even see COC in Google Play. Re-tried clearing the GP cache and data, still not available. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply For those not seeing in Google Play store after installing, You have to go to Google Play Games app in order to install after uninstalling. Your device is listed as not compatible so it will not show up. Also, if you find a copy of the new update By searching coc apk file on Google, it will install by side loading also. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply Here is a link to the latest download for sideloading. http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/supercell/clash-of-clans/clash-clans-8-116-2-android-apk-download/ 01/27/2016 Shawn Reply S5 being playing for a year now suddenly cant play, this is unacceptable, why was the upgrade not tested, when will you resolve it?! 01/27/2016 Umang Reply For everyone who’s facing this problem..go to Google play store through your browser, log in and install the game.

It did not show up on play store but yes did show on play game. Click install on play game redirect me to play store but is list under incompatible device. No install button after that 2. Read comment here and have tried clear cache, data and uninstall update for play store, play game, and play service. Still no luck. Not even show up in play store. 3. Post my comment here and back try again. It just suddenly show up. Install it and play.. No lag no issue. Around 1 hours of time for me to make that god damn stupid install button appear in my play store for doc game! Stupid conclusion from me after tried to install it. Someone say clear 3 time and bulk update. So, MAYBE after we have clear that, it will automatic download the update for playstore and it need sometime for that and without any notification on it. Give it some time after clear cache and data than try again. Hope that’s help. 01/27/2016 Sean Reply Motorola moto 3. Cleared cacache. Nope. Cleared data. Nope.

I hope it works for you all as well. Happy Clashing 01/27/2016 Mike Reply See Dennis comment for fix 01/27/2016 Karl Reply It seems the problem appears when you are in the CoC page in Play Store. Then you get the message of incompatibility. I cleared Play Store cache and data once. Not solved. Did it once more and restarted the phone. Not solved. Instead chose option ‘update all’ on notification drop-down menu. It updated CoC! Opened CoC page in Play Store. Did still after update say device not compatible and no option to open the game. But I can open CoC on the screen shortcut! Problem solved. 01/27/2016 Alex Reply Okay look it worked for me 1. Settings 2. Storage 3. Uninstall Google Play Store 4.

I decided to uninstall the game and check the store, where it still said my device (LG phone) wasn’t compatible. Vexing to say the least. The thing that did the trick was checking in Google Play Games (different application from Play Store) > My Games > Clash of Clans. I was able to download and install CoC from here and it worked.

We tried the “Clear Cache” fix even thought the phone was 2 hours old. This did not fix it. He is the entire reason I play the game. If his can’t be fixed, I will delete mine soon as well.

Join Us On Qantas's First Flight With Wi-Fi Deals: Learn One Of The Most In-Demand Coding Languages For Just $55 The Best Add-ons For Protecting Your Gmail Account David Nield Mar 20, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  browsers email fieldguide security web Share There's no doubt Google runs a tight ship as far as security goes, if you're hacked using Google services its usually (but not always) because of something you did, not Google. If you want to keep your emails on Google's services more secure you'll need to do more than just enable two-factor authentication. You need to practice safe browsing, steering clear of sites and emails that could steal your info. Below are four third-party add-ons you can plug into Gmail to help your navigate the internet a little more safely. They range from add-ons to protect you from phishing attacks (when a hacker tries to social engineer your password out of you) to add-ons to keep Google from peeping at what you send through their email servers. 1) SecureGmail Image: SecureGmail Probably the best name for an add-on designed to improve Gmail security, and there's no doubt SecureGmail is very useful for the privacy-conscious — it encrypts and decrypts all the emails you send and receive in Gmail, before they ever reach Google's servers, so you know that if anyone else should try and extract the contents they won't be able to do so — including Google itself. At the other end the recipient of your email needs a specified password to understand and decode the message, but you don't have to apply this encryption to everything you send through Gmail, so you can save it just for the most sensitive stuff. Like all the best Gmail browser add-ons, it integrates with the original web interface in a clean and seamless way. 2) Ugly Email Image: Screenshot There are plenty of emailers out there who'd like to know when and where you open your messages so they apply a tracker to notify them when you've opened it. If you're not really into that kind of tracking behaviour then there's Ugly Email — add the extension to Chrome and you get a simple eye icon inside your Gmail account on the web if an email contains some kind of tracker. This add-on is for informative purposes only, so you can't really do anything about the tracking except choose not to open up the offending message or have words with the person who sent it, but we like its simple approach and ease-of-use. At the very least you become more aware of the sort of messages coming into your inbox, which is always useful. 3) Gmail Sender Icons Image: Screenshot As the name suggests, Gmail Sender Icons is a Chrome extension that puts favicon symbols next to senders in Gmail, so you can quickly visualise which domain each message is coming from. It gives you that same at-a-glance ease-of-use that you get when looking through the open tabs in your browser, but built right into your Gmail inbox, with virtually no slowdown in speed. So how does it keep you safe? It's another way of flagging spam emails that aren't from respectable sources, and you can spot the potentially dodgy messages before you open them up, or indeed use it to save genuine messages from the Spam folder. The extension itself doesn't store any data, simply parsing your inbox to come up with its labelling. 4) Password Alert Image: Google This last one is from Google itself: A Chrome extension that helps keep you safe against any phishing attempts that may wander into your inbox. It watches out for Google sign-in pages that aren't actually Google sign-in pages, and should you get duped into entering your account password, you'll then get an instant warning asking you to reset it to something else. The extension works by storing a "thumbnail" of your password for comparison purposes, rather than the password itself. And while Gmail already does a decent job of watching out for emails that aren't genuine, shifting them to the Spam folder so you don't get chance to be fooled, but there's no harm in upgrading your protection — plenty of us are still at risk. Comments PeterGills Guest Mar 20, 2017, 10:52am Simplest and best gmail security feature is to use googles own 2 factor authentication. Any new device you use will send a code to your phone. Simple and very effective. Reply 1 Fossa Team Guest Mar 20, 2017, 6:52pm PGP or S/MIME are good options to secure your Gmail. There are plenty of Gmail extensions to do it Maivelope, CryptUp, Jumble, FossaGuard, ...etc Why not mention them alongside with SecureMail? Reply 0 Join the discussion!

You’ll need Bitmoji for Chrome and then you can access your Bitmoji anytime you need them. We’ll even show you how to integrate Gmail Bitmoji directly. This is the easiest way to use Bitmoji on Facebook, Messenger, Google Hangouts, WeChat and practically any other app on you Mac or PC. Right now you can only use Bitmoji on Mac or PC by installing the Google Chrome browser on your device. This is a free download that is compatible with most devices. If work locks down your computer, you may not be able to install Chrome. There is no Bitmoji Safari or Bitmoji Edge extension. How to use Bitmoji for Mac and PC. How to use Bitmoji on Mac & PC In less than five minutes you can start using Bitmoji on your computer. This is what you need to do to set up Bitmoji on your computer and how to use it. Download and Install Chrome. Install the Bitmoji for Chrome Extension Sign Into Bitmoji on your computer Click to add Bitmoji to Gmail if you want. Once you finish these steps, Bitmoji is installed on your computer. You access it in Chrome, but you can use it on a wide range of services and in a number of apps. Click the Bitmoji icon in Chrome and then copy any Bitmoji you want to use In Chrome, click on the small Bitmoji icon in the upper corner of the browser. This will open the Bitmoji picker that you normally see in the Bitmoji keyboard on iPhone and iPad. Your Bitmoji is already customized, so there is nothing else to do but start using it. Right click on a Bitmoji that you want to use and choose copy image. You can then paste that image in almost any app on your computer to send the Bitmoji. You can click and drag the Bitmoji to some apps, but this doesn’t work with every app out there. How to use Bitmoji in Gmail. If you chose to install Bitmoji for Gmail during the setup, you will see your Bitmoji face in the bottom of a new email screen in Gmail. Click on the face to open the Bitmoji picker and then click on a Bitmoji to insert it in your email. There is no need to copy and paste. One problem that we ran into with Bitmoji for Chrome is that most of our Bitmojis would not load. If this happens, you can restart Chrome or if that doesn’t work sign out of Bitmoji and sign back in. The second step solved out Bitmoji Chrome problems. Everything We Expect Apple to Announce in 2017 iPhone 8   1 / 10 We expect the iPhone 8 from Apple this year. This is the flagship iPhone for 2017, and it may only come in one size.  Expect a huge 5.8-inch or 5.5-inch display in a phone that isn't much bigger than the iPhone 7. Apple will switch to OLED, like the screens on Samsung smartphones.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Movies Latest Google Play Music Update Adds Wi-Fi Streaming And Playback Quality Options By Zara Ali Mar 16, 2017 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Google has updated its Play Music app, which now gives the app a full-blown functionality of Wi-Fi streaming and offline music. These new options have been placed under ‘Playback’ in Settings menu. Also, there is a new option that allows you to set “Quality on a wifi network.” Previously, Google only allowed the functionality for streaming quality on cellular networks. Within the new quality option, the default is always set to ‘Always High,’ which obviously playbacks the highest quality. However, with the high-quality playback, there might be some issues of buffering that is not a welcome pause, so you can always set the quality to Low, Normal, and High so that your music does not get interrupted due to network issues. Related Android O Developer Preview : New Features And Enhancements That You Must Know Advertisement Besides, “Download quality” under ‘Downloading’ option is also segmented into three options – Low, Normal, and High. With ‘Low’ quality you can save storage on your device, but if you are an audiophile and can’t bear low-quality music then better set it to high. Also, it is not yet clear whether the already saved music can also be compressed and how much space it would save if they also get compressed. Google had been testing these features since long, and in the previous version of the app, many users could identify these additions. Today, Google has made them available to all the Play Music app users. It brings the app to version 7.5 on all devices. It is currently being rolled out to Android phones through the Play Store. The new update now lets the app stream and store songs at higher quality. It brings Google Play Music among other music streaming apps such as Spotify and Tidal that offer Wi-Fi streaming on higher bitrates. It must be noted that for downloaded audio, the file would eat up device storage while streaming over Wi-Fi could take a toll on data.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Apple, Google and Facebook Have Backed Away From Fighting Trump’s Latest Travel Ban By Rafia Shaikh Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Earlier in February, a number of tech companies had filed a legal brief opposing President Trump’s first executive order on immigration. Apple and Google were among the first to respond to this travel ban. However, these tech giants have now reportedly “backed away” from the legal fight against the second version of this travel ban. Apple, Facebook, Google, and others “skip” fighting the second travel ban “Apple, Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order,” Reuters reported late last night. Related [Updated: More Join] Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, and Others File Legal Brief to Oppose President’s Immigration Order While the first amicus brief that was filed to oppose the original executive order had received support from 127 companies, the latest brief filed in the federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed support of only 58 companies. Advertisement Microsoft, Dropbox, Netflix, Twitter, Intel, Kickstarter are some other companies that had supported the original brief but didn’t sign the latest one. However, while Reuters’ report is based on the fact that the above-mentioned companies haven’t signed the “friend-of-the-court” brief yet, they could still do so. For example, Uber was reported to be in the process of adding its name to the brief. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” It should be noted that Google and Apple were among the most outspoken companies who not only signed the original brief but had also donated to the crisis funds. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said it is “painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues”. Cofounder Sergey Brin was also spotted at a march at San Francisco International Airport. Apple CEO Tim Cook had written a letter to his staff, noting that “Apple would not exist without immigration“. Reuters added that while the lawsuit may have lost some big names, it is still likely to succeed. A Hawaiian judge last night ordered an emergency halt to the latest ban, saying that it would cause “irreparable injury” by violating First Amendment protections against religious discrimination. Another judge in Maryland also blocked the latest travel ban, which was due to begin midnight on Thursday. President Trump has called this ruling “unprecedented judicial overreach”. Related Uber CEO Quits President Trump’s Economic Council After Criticism While it is unlikely that Apple, Google or other tech companies are more favorable to the second travel ban considering how heavily they rely on immigrants, none of the companies responded to a Reuters’ query on why they have chosen not to sign the latest brief.

It is also the reported codename Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is using for one of three rumored successors to the Google Pixel smartphone. The “taimen” may be one of three new Pixel phones due for release this year. The others — codenamed “walleye” and “muskie” — are reported to be 5-inch and 5.5-inch devices, respectively. The size of “taimen” is unknown, but one might safely assume that it would be bigger than either of the other two. A report Tuesday at Droid-Life confirmed the codenames for “walleye” and “muskie,” and included the possibility of a “taimen” phone. Google promoted its two Pixel phones — the Pixel and Pixel XL — heavily during the recent holiday season, and investment bank Evercore ISI estimated that the company sold more than 550,000 units in the United States during the fourth quarter of last year. Another estimate, from Monness Crespi Hardt, put worldwide quarterly sales at 1 million units. An initial estimate from Morgan Stanley projected total worldwide sales of 3 million units. The numbers pale, however, when compared with sales of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone, which sold 75 million units in the fourth quarter, or Samsung’s sales of the Galaxy S7, with 9 million unit sales in the phone’s first month of availability. Still, Google’s sales were good enough, and the critical reception was strong enough for the company to move ahead with a second version of the Pixel phones. There are some issues though. For instance, does Google’s exclusive deal with Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) as the only mobile carrier for the Pixel phones put a ceiling on sales? The phones are also available unlocked directly from Google or one of its retail partners, but that’s not the same as having the other three major U.S. carriers on board as well. For now, with nothing more than rumors to go on, it appears that Google is determined to make yet another push into producing hardware. Can it avoid another Nexus mess? Stay tuned.

Dan K: “TeenVogue pushing policy. Not an earth-shattering article in itself, but nice to see, the kids need to know.” Yes, so good to see Teen Vogue offering more to its young readers than make up tips. My teenage magazines sure never carried this kind of thing. Jeremy Scahill of The Intercept recently (March 8) had a Teen Vogue contributor on his Intercepted podcast. They had a long discussion on immigration. March 8 podcast transcript. He said: I’m joined now by independent journalist Aura Bogado. She recently has been contributing to Teen Vogue, a magazine that actually has emerged as an important news organization. It’s not a joke. It’s true. Teen Vogue is now a very good publication on the very issues that we talk about on this show and that we cover at The Intercept. I’ve worked with Aura before. I’ve known her for many years, and it’s a pleasure to welcome Aura Bogado to Intercepted. The current Teen Vogue issue has stories on Trump’s second travel ban being blocked, and military academy sexual assault. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef March 16, 2017 at 10:01 am Whether is sex or drugs, abstinence only education just doesn’t work. We can’t ban human nature – to be human is to engage in sex or…to be greedy….except many Zen monks. Greed – you can’t criminalize it any more than marijuana. Aborting the subsequent birthing of concentrated wealth is the way to go. Then we can live to learn with greed (and corruption – also human nature). But the wealth-abortion should be freely available. “We are here to help…to abort your concentrated wealth.” Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen March 16, 2017 at 10:52 am It’s true: According to a new report from Child Trends, a nonprofit research organization that specializes in child health and development, increasing access to the full range of birth control methods — i.e. everything from the basic pill form to an IUD you have inserted — could reduce unintended pregnancies by 64 percent. 64 percent. What’s more? It also shows that it could reduce abortions by 67 (!) percent nationally, which would in turn cut related costs to our health-care system by $12 billion annually. At some point, you’ve got to start thinking that positions on this issue, particularly from pro-“lifers,” are about more than just the ardent fetus love they so vocally profess ad nauseam. Reply ↓ craazyboy March 16, 2017 at 11:36 am Always good to follow the money. But not to the point of becoming a groper, please. That would be rude. Reply ↓ Malcolm MacLeod, MD March 16, 2017 at 10:01 pm Linda, after a long and enjoyable career in general pediatrics in northern California, I can say with ease that ALL teenagers of any sex must become experts in all of the modalities of birth control, except for early withdrawal. Nowadays, the vast majority of them screw like rabbits, no matter what they proclaim. We used to lose a lot of the girls through criminal abortion, when BCPs, the morning after pill, diaphragms, ad nauseum were less available. In this enlightened age, we need more and better sex and fewer pregnancies. We were born to have sex and it’s not a luxury, but rather a blessed necessity, even though it causes heaps of trouble, and keeps all kinds of lawyers busy. Eventually, one must face up to reality. Reply ↓ vlade March 16, 2017 at 7:37 am While I agree with the general thrust of the FT “no back door for the City” article, one point I’d make is that while US kept USD clearing, it didn’t stop a large EuroDollar market to be created in the UK – although the reasons, conditions etc. were very different of course (not to mention that USD regulator didn’t really mind, and EUR regulator could well mind, especially if given a political task to do so). Otherwise, those who think no-SM-access-Brexit will have no significant impact on the UK finance are living in a lala land. Funnily enough, if Scots do get away with their independence, the next centrum – at least for Asset management, may well turn out to be Edinburgh (as quite a few AMs are already located there). Scots of course would have to wait to be admitted to the EU, or alternatively, join Ireland (together with NI), and maybe create “United Kingdom of Ireland and Northern Great Britain”. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorMarch 16, 2017 at 8:45 am The US can and has very effectively used its control of dollar clearing to dictate terms to foreign players in $, witness Standard Chartered as the first big case, where Benjamin Lawsky wrote an order when they were caught out doctoring wires on a systematic basis to trade $250 billion (yes, correct order of magnitude, over a number of years) with Iran in defiance of sanctions. It really did pretty much say to the CEO: You are showing up in a hearing at this date and time to tell me why I shouldn’t yank your New York branch license” which would be catastrophic. Needless to say, despite screams of rage from Standard Chartered and every banking regulator in DC, Lawsky prevailed. In other words, if you clear, you are also providing the lender/liquidity provider of the last resort capability. You are gonna make sure banks do things your way for that privilege. The US could have prevented the growth of the Eurodollar business. I’ve read historical accounts with some detail as to the mechanisms that were available to stop it. There were reasons at the time the US thought it was to our advantage to allow it. I forget what they were, however. Reply ↓ vlade March 16, 2017 at 9:22 am That’s why I wrote “not to mention that USD regulator didn’t really mind, and EUR regulator could well mind, especially if given a political task to do so”. That said, the regulatory approaches to that can change as the political winds blow – but regardless of that (and it’s not something that would happen overnight, building EuroDollar took decade+ IIRC) after Brexit UK (including its finance industry) will be much different from what it is now. Reply ↓ Michael Hudson March 16, 2017 at 12:32 pm Yves, I remember very well why the US didn’t stop the growth of the eurodollar market in the 1960s. I was Chase’s BoP economist at the time. The single largest source of deposits was from Chase’s London office — eurodollars deposited with the head office. These deposits had NO RESERVE REQUIREMENT. A young kid was in charge of it, and outpolled the real estate and international departments.

This was Washington Monthly’s organizing theme back in the early days. One should also say that some of his ideas were not taken up. For example, from the Post article This brings us to another fundamental tenet of neo-liberalism: We generally oppose requiring a law degree or similar paper credentials for most jobs. People should be judged on their demonstrated ability to perform, not on their possession of degrees and other credentials. Did you read that Paul Blair, an ex-major leaguer, was denied the right to coach high school baseball because he didn’t have a teaching credential? Another example of this concern is the recent criticism of Marva Collins, the black Chicago teacher who started her own school to help poor children. Some ofthe the criticism may be justified, but one charge — that she lacks a teaching certificate — is the sort of thing that makes me desperate, particularly since the press solemnly reported the charge without the slightest suggestion that a teacher’s certificate may not have any relation to teaching ability. The proof is that many of the best private schools do not require teacher’s certificates. What they care about is that the teacher can teach. Neo-liberals share this concern with actual performance because they want to encourage productivity and discourage the bureacratization that credentialism fosters. Peters also didn’t think much of the traditional press and so gets brownie points for that. Reply ↓ Grebo March 16, 2017 at 6:53 pm I’ve noted before that Peters’ Neoliberalism is not what we generally mean by Neoliberalism today, but was an attempt to resurrect the New Deal. Our Neoliberals are sworn to bury the New Deal. So I’m not sure that the accusation of hypocrisy in the the blurb is warranted. Reply ↓ UserFriendly March 16, 2017 at 7:21 pm As I noted in a follow up email that didn’t make the cut. yeah, it’s actually kinda shocking how spot on some of the criticism is. It really makes me feel like we are always solving the problems of our parents generation. Reply ↓ Procopius March 17, 2017 at 8:45 pm I was struck by: We have found these responses not only weren’t helping but were often hampering us in confronting the problems that were beginning to cripple the nation in the 1970s: declining productivity; the closed factories and potholed roads that betrayed decaying plant and infrastructure; inefficient and unaccountable public agencies that were eroding confidence in government; a military with too many weapons that didn’t work and too few people from the upper classes in its ranks; and a politics of selfishness symbolized by an explosion of political action committees devoted to the interests of single groups. That part sounds like he was writing today. I’ve come to think of the ’70s as kind of the line of demarcation. Most of the trends we think of as bringing about neoliberalism, the Washington Consensus, started under Jimmy Carter.

Reply ↓ JoeK March 16, 2017 at 9:20 pm “I’ve tried really hard to care about things that were very different from my parents.” “Tried hard to care;” did she succeed in caring? If you have to try “really hard” to care, you don’t, really. Sounds like a Freudian slip. “were very different;” present perfect segues to simple past, another tell as to the sincerity (or rather lack thereof) of her caring. “from my parents;” she must mean “from my parents’ [pseudo-] concerns.” Most likely an unconscious attempt to distance herself from her progenitors (a reading bolstered by her thou-protesteth-too-much addition of “proudly as a daughter”). Let’s hope she’s not entrusted with teaching English Composition 101. As one of my writing profs. said, “clear writing requires clear thinking.” He’d doubtless give that one sentence alone a bath in red ink. The part about being “curious about $$$;” I think she’s hinting (again whether she consciously understands it or not) that curiosity is sufficient impetus to make marital vows (for one).

In addition, he is called to investigate an incident where whales and sea-borne mussels seemed to have attacked and incapacitated a commercial freighter. When he returns to his whale watching job, he witnesses how humpback whales and orcas attack the watcher’s boats. The whales work together to capsize the boats and then kill the people drifting in the water. A large number of tourists and close colleagues of Anawak are killed. The events that are witnessed by the protagonists are only part of a worldwide phenomenon. Several other attacks are briefly described in the plot: Swimmers are driven from the coast by sharks and venomous jellyfish. Commercial ships are attacked and sometimes destroyed in a variety of ways. France sees an outbreak of an epidemic that is caused by lobsters contaminated with a highly lethal type of Pfiesteria. When it becomes clear that all those events are related, an international scientific task force is created under the lead of the United States. The task force is led by Lieutenant General Judith Li, a close friend and adviser to the President; the protagonists become part of it.

If you believe Mary Hershberger’s unsparing account on the truthdig website – to be fair, there are vigorous and detailed denunciations of her report by McCain’s defenders – imprudent actions by McCain may have started the fire. What seems undisputed is his extremely Flashmanesque behavior in the immediate aftermath of the lethal inferno. McCain promptly quit the stricken ship with the late R.W. “Johny” Apple Jr., of the New York Times, who wrote him up in handsome terms a few weeks later. Thee flames still smouldering and the body bags barely zipped, McCain bounded into a helicopter and flew to Saigon for, in his own breezy words, “some welcome R&R”, even as somber memorials for his dead shipmates were held aboard the Forrestal. Flashman to the life. He then raced to London for an important private session with the man who would preside over the inquiry into the Forrestal disaster, the officer in question being his own father, Admiral John McCain, at that time the Navy’s top man in Europe, soon to become overall commander of all forces in Vietnam. ========================================================= Entire article is well worth reading.

And there’s a lot of people looking for it.’” ========================================= It wasn’t that long ago that the CIA spied on Senate staffers – Congress, undoubtedly acknowledging that they can’t keep a secret about anything other than donors, magnanimously forgave the CIA and associated surveillance. Former Dem rep: I got wiretapped during Obama admininstration (yes, its misspelled – I am not the editor of Hot Air) “However, what happened afterward is notable. Kucinich is correct that any conversation with a member of Congress that doesn’t involve a criminal investigation should have been off limits to intelligence operatives. They should have disconnected at that point and referred the matter to the DoJ, which could have discussed the contact directly with Kucinich if they felt it was important enough to investigate. Instead, not only did they stay on the line, they retained the recording, transcribed it, and archived it — and eventually leaked it to the media while identifying Kucinich. That is a swipe at the separation of powers and the concept of co-equal branches, treads dangerously close to political interference, and it closely resembles what happened to Flynn. The lesson here is that broad powers of surveillance will get used broadly, and the risk of abuse for political purposes is high. Congress should investigate Kucinich’s allegations along with Trump’s to see whether those abuses have happened, who knew about them, and whether agents had permission or orders to conduct it from political appointees in their organizations.” ====================== “Instead, not only did they stay on the line, they retained the recording, transcribed it, and archived it — and eventually leaked it to the media while identifying Kucinich.” AND “treads dangerously close” – if that isn’t kicking it and than running over it with a steamroller, I don’t know what is… And I note, leaked for what was obviously partisan purposes, OR if not partisan purposes, for CIA PURPOSES. Will Trump have the subtlety of mind to understand what happened and how to use it against his CIA opponents??? Will Trump have the gumption to really take on the IC, or has he already been transmogrified into a cold warrior by the McCain/Graham proselytizers? Its an outrage how much surveillance goes on. But this has shown that despite the high regard the media now holds the CIA in, the CIA confirms its right to rejigger an election (including USA) when the results don’t suit the CIA’s agenda. And if not that, than the appointees who get to serve in it. If the democrats involved in this, it is pretty bad. If it is the CIA alone, it is much worse. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood March 16, 2017 at 10:09 am With the CIA having become America’s Stasi, East German history becomes quite relevant in interpreting CIA behavior: Stasi officers discussed rebranding East Germany as a democratic capitalist country to the West, but which in practice would have been taken over by Stasi officers. The plan specified 2,587 OibE officers (Offiziere im besonderen Einsatz, “officers on special assignment”) who would have assumed power as detailed in the Top Secret Document 0008-6/86 of 17 March 1986. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi Apparently the CIA prefers to rule more invisibly through the threat of Zersetzung directed at errant politicians. It means secretly destroying their self confidence by leaking intercepted communications, damaging their reputation, organizing failures in their work, and destroying their personal relationships.

Clicking that link brings up a menu, one of whose options is “Advanced”. Choose that which will take you to the advanced Google search page. Here you’ll find a large array of search qualifiers which allow one to focus one’s search more precisely. One parameter I find very useful in some circumstances is “site or domain”. So if I’m looking for something I know has appeared in Naked Capitalism I simply put nakedcapitalism.com in that field. Another is “last update” which lets me focus my search on only new items. Using those two in combination will limit results to recent items from NC. Reply ↓ JoeK March 16, 2017 at 10:08 pm True, but why is “advanced search” buried like that in the first place? Actually, IIRC it used to be more visible/easier to access–for example, I like to ogle watches I can’t afford and my favorite site for doing so has the link right under the search field. Call me cynical but it appears google doesn’t want users to create search enquiries that will negatively impact their secondary raison d’être (I place making $$$ via advertising below data mining/privacy invasion/surveillance). Crapitalism is indeed crapifying the www; yes content producers need to make money, but the way it’s being solicited from readers these days makes many pages nearly unreadable.

Reply ↓ allan March 16, 2017 at 9:21 am Trump resets U.S.-Saudi relations, in Saudi Arabia’s favor [WaPo] President Trump’s new deal with Saudi Arabia is really good — for the Saudis. After publicly bashing the kingdom for years, Trump completely reversed course Tuesday and rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi royals. He gave them a huge publicity boost and a highly sought-after U.S. commitment to improve and elevate bilateral relations. And what did Trump get in return? Not much at all. … I’m old enough to remember when certain commenters claimed that Trump would disrupt, in a good way, our relationships with tyrannical regimes in the Middle East, while Clinton would be more of the same. How’s that working? … The Saudi leadership saw Hillary Clinton as more aligned with them on regional issues, but still worried that she would have insisted on Saudi political reform and respect for human rights, even conditioning U.S. military and financial support on progress on those fronts. But with the Trump administration, that’s no longer an issue. … Reply ↓ Pat March 16, 2017 at 9:33 am Gee, I remember Clinton making noises about those issues when she was in a position to approve arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Oh…wait… Other than reportage from about Saudi leadership about what they feared from Clinton based on unknown sources from a clearly anti-Trump pro-Clinton news source where again do we get any indication of these concerns. Oh..wait… Am I happy about this? No. Do I think for a moment anything would have been different if Clinton had been elected in this regard? Well, yes, I do. I’m sure the Clinton Foundation would still exist and there would have been a big donation to it in January from those self same Saudi leaders. So yes, Clinton would have gotten a better deal for Clinton. Reply ↓ allan March 16, 2017 at 9:42 am From WhiteHouse.gov: Readout of the President’s Meeting with Mohammed bin Salman Abdulaziz Al Saud, Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Yesterday at the White House, President Donald J. Trump and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reaffirmed their support for a strong, broad, and enduring strategic partnership based on a shared interest and commitment to the stability and prosperity of the Middle East region. They directed their teams to explore additional steps across a broad range of political, military, security, economic, cultural, and social dimensions to further strengthen and elevate the United States-Saudi strategic relationship for the benefit of both countries. U.S. and Saudi officials intend to consult on additional steps to deepen commercial ties and promote investment, and to expand cooperation in the energy sector. The President and the Deputy Crown Prince noted the importance of confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional activities while continuing to evaluate and strictly enforce the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The President expressed his strong desire to achieve a comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to continue the two countries’ consultations to help reach solutions for regional issues. More broadly, the President and Deputy Crown Prince noted the ongoing security and military cooperation between the two countries in confronting Daesh/ISIS and other transnational terrorist organizations that pose a threat to all nations. The two countries announced their determination to strengthen their cooperation in the economic, commercial, investment, and energy fields, with the aim of realizing growth and prosperity in the two countries and the global economy. President Trump provided his support for developing a new United States-Saudi program, undertaken by joint U.S.-Saudi working groups, and its unique initiatives in energy, industry, infrastructure, and technology worth potentially more than $200 billion in direct and indirect investments within the next four years. The President also provided his support for United States investments in Saudi Arabia and the facilitation of bilateral trade, which will result in sizable opportunities for both countries. On energy, the two countries affirmed their desire to continue bilateral consultations in a way that enhances the growth of the global economy and limits supply disruption and market volatility. The two countries highlighted that expanded economic cooperation could create as many as one million direct American jobs within the next four years, millions of indirect American jobs, as well as jobs in Saudi Arabia. The Deputy Crown Prince reviewed Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 program for the President and agreed to put in place specific bilateral programs to help both countries benefit from new opportunities created by the Kingdom’s implementation of those new economic plans. [emphasis added] Dick Cheney couldn’t have said it any better. Compare and contrast with the campaign rhetoric quoted in the WaPo article I first linked to. But that was then and this is now. Reply ↓ Pat March 16, 2017 at 10:07 am Yes it is disappointing to end up exactly where we would have with President Clinton. Sorry it saved the Saudi’s a few million dollar ‘donation’ to the Clinton Foundation. Although either group having that money is disgusting. As for your bold facing, not just usual rhetoric it is business as usual with regards to the ‘energy’ business and our relationship with SA. I do find the limiting volatility thing amusing though. The current volatility is the race to cheap oil. See the failure of the OPEC agreement discussed here on NC just a couple of days ago. Neither country has a means of stopping that particular slide. Reply ↓ cocomaan March 16, 2017 at 10:51 am You could argue that Exxon is probably going to benefit, so the cash going to the Foundation is now just going to a corporation instead. The House of Saud are some of the most horrific people on the planet. Trump just capitulated to them in a massive middle finger to supporters who thought his tough talk on Islamic extremism would result in something meaningful. Reply ↓ Pat March 16, 2017 at 11:18 am Not sure Exxon is going to benefit, but yeah they might. And if there are any benefits to this it is to a small group of people largely in the energy sector. Since I think SA and Israel’s influence in our foreign policies and in our government as one of the top five problems facing this country, I am extremely disappointed that this was just another campaign ‘promise’, and we do get what we would have gotten without the ‘change’ candidate getting office. And yes, like the GOP plan for ACA replacement, it is a big screw you to his supporters (and even those of us who don’t support him). It is especially upsetting if you believe like I do that much of the religious extremism we see in the Middle East is being spread by SA and terrorism centered there is even supported by them. Although I also know that much of the terrorism only pretends to be about Islam it is about power, same as many perhaps even most evangelical Christian preachers and Christianity. Reply ↓ craazyboy March 16, 2017 at 12:41 pm I do recall Hillary was in favor of restarting the draft and making young girls eligible for the draft as well – making it all a merry “woke” thing with equal opportunity, equal pay and all those good things. The young servicewomen could end up shipped to Saudi, or the front lines of Yemen, or even lead the charge when we, the Saudis, and Israel inevitably decide to liberate Iran. I’m not sure this scenario has really ended with Hillary, but it’s something we can still hope for. What we really have here is the inability of the US to find a way to untie this Gordian Knot binding us together with the ME. In recent years, we have been trying to employ or partner with some nasty thugs to avoid having to put too many of our own boots on the ground. Limited pragmatic success so far, except for Russia at least temporarily making headway in Syria. ‘Course in that case, Russia beat up our thugs. And we could be on opposite sides when it comes time to liberate Iran. This is a labyrinth I can never find my way out of. Goblin Kings everywhere.

My wife and I shoveled our way out and are now better in shape for the effort. The average person just does not need a snowblower, it’s ludicrous. Reply ↓ HotFlash March 16, 2017 at 11:52 am Yup, and it is not as if there are not people who could shovel snow for them. A. M. Smith’s heroine in the The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency series (set in Botswana) talks disapprovingly about a university professor who is well-compensated, but will not share his bounty with others, specifically, allows his house to be neglected rather than hire a housekeeper and a gardener. OTOH, I remember reading (here? FDL?) a comment by a woman whose husband, a college professor who was, um, indifferent to fashion, getting an offer from neighbour lady, “I’ll give you a sandwich for shovelling my walk.” On my street we have an unorganized snow shovelling coop. Whoever feels like/has the time to shovel does for the 6-7 or so houses on our block, plus we tend to do our across-the-street neighbours if we have time/energy, seniors and disabled first. Been going for 5 yrs or so, works great.

Reply ↓ drexciya March 16, 2017 at 9:46 am I’m getting sick of the reports about the Dutch elections. The media are seeing this as a loss for populism, but that’s just spin. There was a very high number of people that voted, which is quite something to begin with. Next up is the “fact” that “far-right”/populist parties didn’t “win”. Actually, they did win: – PVV got +5 seats, not much, but still they’re the second largest party now – FvD (new party) got 2 seats – VVD and CDA took up some of the PVV’s talking points – Left as a whole lost, and the PvdA got clobbered – Most likely will be a combination of VVD-CDA-D66-CU, which is a center-right cabinet What I really don’t understand is that there’s no attention being given to DENK, which is a party aligned with the dictatorial regime in Turkey. These people used to stay undercover inside other parties, but they’ve shown their true colors. Reply ↓ HotFlash March 16, 2017 at 11:54 am This is very interesting. Can you recommend some links?

Migrating might be a bad idea for anyone struggling economically if they leave the people they know where they are and it’s an initial upfront cost as well, but even leaving that aside. Let’s imagine leaving California for Texas. Texas has the most people without ANY form of health coverage in the entire nation! So the rent wont’ be California rent that as a poor person you have to struggle to afford, but OTOH the maybe not initially obvious trade off is if you get sick and your poor your gonna die.

All indications are that that delusion should be in shreds by May. And that more people should get they were being scammed by Obama and most of the Democratic leadership.

When the GOP noticed that young boom getting older and the New Deal generation (guess who they voted for) dying off, older voters became sharply more conservative. Pretty soon, email chains were everywhere (computer engineers and IT people are overwhelmingly republican) explaining the aging GOP voter as connected to wisdom gained with age. The Democrats winning all those young people in 2006 and 2008 and then proceeding to dump on them destroyed the opportunity to produce a new New Deal generation and permanent Democratic majority.

Income disparities have become so pronounced that America’s top 10 percent now average nearly nine times as much income as the bottom 90 percent. Americans in the top 1 percent tower stunningly higher. They average over 38 times more income than the bottom 90 percent. But that gap pales in comparison to the divide between the nation’s top 0.1 percent and everyone else. Americans at this lofty level are taking in over 184 times the income of the bottom 90 percent. ============================================================== Well…..just like fracking, the fact that there is less and less wealth to pump from the 90% does not mean that we have reached peak inequality…..

It resulted in Trump’s effective rate going from about 4% to about 24%. But there has been almost no reporting on this (or, to be fair, commentary from Democrats who in theory should be interested in pointing this out). And now this piece in the NYT, which goes on and on about how bad the AMT is, until grudgingly admitting, in the last paragraph, that for Trump in 2005 it functioned as intended. Inquiring minds want to know: Does the publisher of the NYT have to pay AMT? Mr. Sulzberger, release those returns! Reply ↓ jrs March 16, 2017 at 1:29 pm because it makes taxes way more complex as it’s two parallel tax systems. Progressive taxation is one thing, taxing capital gains at the same rate as income is one thing, getting rid of most deductions might also be a good idea. With all that, you’d have Trump paying more taxes I’d bet. But noone likes taxes that they have to spend days of unpaid labor trying to figure out and then still worry about. Taxes are a tax on time, at least when they are that complex. Funny I think they are probably far less a tax on time for those who actually ARE rich and can just hire the best tax accountants money can buy, than everyone else scratching their head at their tax software which is all they can afford. Reply ↓ allan March 16, 2017 at 2:03 pm I have been hit with the possibility of paying the AMT a couple of times (not recently) and, yes, it is a pain to have to calculate your return twice, in two very different ways. But taxes on time come in many forms – fighting with health insurance companies, long layovers at hubs because of our airline oligopoly, lines at understaffed banks – and many of them yield no benefit to me or society. I’m more than willing to spend time on a system that also forces rich people to pay their fair share. The NYT story said that in fact many wealthy are still able to avoid the AMT, but provided no figures, and you have to wonder whether the Gray Lady protesteth too much. Reply ↓ Chauncey Gardiner March 16, 2017 at 1:03 pm Thank you for the clarifying article from Fabius Maximus. I agree that the Fed is focused on wage pressures, and that they likely look at momentum in the KC Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Index as a key determinant of policy direction regarding interest rates. I believe their approach dates back to the Fed’s experience during the hyperinflation of the late-1970s and early 1980s, and the aggressive monetary policy actions that Volcker took at that time to suppress wages under the “Fed’s dual mandate” argument. I suspect they are averse to repeating that episode due to its adverse effect on stock and bond prices, and would rather preempt emergence of wage pressures and run the risk of erring on the other side. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FRBKCLMCIM I also suspect some other cross currents play an unstated but significant role, and that key Fed constituencies are now complaining of interest rate margin compression as potential trading gains have largely been realized from the long-term rise in the bond market which has run up against the zero bound in interest rates. However, I also believe the Fed has continued to underestimate the magnitude and duration of the damage to Labor stemming from the 2007-09 economic collapse which so impaired consumers debt servicing capacity. Further, the Urban Consumer Price Index is now running hotter than growth in Disposable Personal Income as the effects of debt leverage from QE-ZIRP in elevating real estate prices and other maladjustments are revealed in the real economy. Reply ↓ Editor of the Fabius Maximus website March 16, 2017 at 5:59 pm Chauncey, The Fed might heavily weight a Labor Market Conditions Index in their policy decisions. But which one? The KC Fed’s LMCI shows strong momentum. But the Fed’s LMCI has been slowing for 5 years, its growth rate peaking in January 2012. Its level has been flat since December 2015. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FRBLMCI https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/updating-the-labor-market-conditions-index-20141001.html You point to a second factor that Fed leaders seldom mention but which is rumored to be significant: the needs of Wall Street and the larger banking industry. They might want higher rates, and the Fed has a history of often giving banks what they want. Unfortunately, what the banks want and how the Fed weights that input are matters for guessing.

Its almost like those programs were designed to spend money on them. After all, When America Was Great, the average life expectancy was much lower than today and re-achieving that pinnacle of greatness should be an obvious economic goal to reduce federal budget deficits while providing for tax cuts to the wealthy.

Commenter Freya Beth says it best: I have to say I am glad that the author has refrained from commenting about feminism until now as she has no idea what feminism means. The patronising use of the term “ladies” is a bad start and it just gets worse from there. Obviously, examples of exaggerated outrage-mongering are not hard to find in social media, from either the left or the right. To take a couple of extreme examples and then claim that the “feminist left” (whatever that is) is driving men to the extreme right of white supremacy, hansonism and misogyny is not only offensive but absurd. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Oh, except, you just did! It is not only bizarre, it is also victim blaming: men are misogynist because feminists are mean to them! You do know that is straight out the MRA handbook don’t you? This piece is really a denial of the entire concept of feminism itself. I’m not sure what the author thinks feminism is, but feminists at least agree on the premise that women are oppressed by virtue of being women. That this concept involves an oppressed and an oppressor is just too much for the author to accommodate. Speaking of exaggeration, the author makes liberal use of dishonest misrepresentations herself. Including a series of bizarre rhetorical questions which bear no relation to anything any feminist has ever thought or said: “Are you telling me I should dismiss my (male I assume?) partner’s hard work….?” Who?! What?!? Nope. You just made that up too. Reply ↓ flora March 16, 2017 at 11:52 pm oh gosh. I have a completely different take, having listened to self-described radical feminists 40 years ago discussing whether, in an all female commune, male children should be put up for adoption or killed outright, since males ipso facto were enemies. No kidding. I am not making this up. I thought they were nuts but they were dead serious, so to speak. I think the author of this article is saying don’t alienate your allies, and don’t assume your allies are id-pol agreed on groups or individuals. Reply ↓ flora March 16, 2017 at 11:57 pm I should add that no women who advocated killing male children actually had children, male or female. The women who did have children thought the discussion was crazy. They were accused of being insufficiently feminist. Oy. And no, no children were either threatened or harmed.

Following the company’s refusal to accept responsivity for content. According to The Independent, banks have joined other multinational companies in the UK to pull ads from Google over hate preachers. The companies are said to be embittered over their ads appearing side-by-sides videos being posted by extremists like the Islamic State, ISIS on YouTube. Three of UK’s biggest banks including HSBC, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) expressed fears that some of their budgets for ads are being used to fund banned hate preachers, extremists, terrorist organizations and racists among others. The bank’s decision is coming on the heels of other blue chip companies that have taken similar steps to pull ads from Google’s streaming website, YouTube. Other companies that have that have expressed their displeasure over Google’s nonchalant attitude towards the videos include, motor giant Audi, McDonald’s, L’Oreal, the BBC, The Guardian, Channel 4, and a couple of government agencies. Their action does not only end with ads on YouTube, but affects Google search as well. This development could significantly affect Google’s dominance of online ads as more companies are on the verge of taking similar step to express their displeasure. The Independent reports that Sky, Barclays and Vodafone are believed to be making plans to withdraw their ads as well. Unless Google changes its policy to please these heavyweights, its dominance is about to face its biggest tests in recent times. Urgent steps need to be taken by Google to win back the loyalty of the companies if it wants it doesn’t want to find itself in a situation where its profit will be highly affected. According to investigation carried out by The Times, loads of multinational companies have had their ads shown alongside YouTube videos posted by extremists. A case in point is a video posted by a former leader of the Klu Klux Klan, David Duke. Other hate preachers have also been receiving payouts from Google, and the companies feel they have been directly or indirectly funding such groups. Ads funded by tax payers have also been appearing alongside hate videos; and this continues to anger a lot of people, organizations and government departments. Google’s refusal to accept responsibility for content being posted on its platform is a big issue. The company insists it cannot be categorized as a media organization, which makes it difficult to be regulated same way media companies are being controlled. Speaking to Business Insider on why it is important for Google alongside Facebook should admit they are media organizations, Sir Martin Sorrell, head of global ad agency WPP said: “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” Mr Sorrell said, per The Independent.  “They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.” Got something to add to this story?

PublishedMar 20, 2017, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/47Wn Copy LONDON • Google has announced changes to its advertising policies after major brands pulled advertisements from the platform because they appeared alongside offensive content, such as videos promoting terrorism or anti-Semitism. The US company said in a blog post last Friday that it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on YouTube, the video-sharing service it owns, and the Google Display Network, which posts advertising to third-party websites. The announcement came after the British government and The Guardian newspaper pulled advertisements from the video site, stepping up pressure on YouTube to police content on its platform. France's Havas, the world's sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, also pulled its British clients' ads from Google and YouTube last Friday after failing to get assurances from Google that the ads would not appear next to offensive material. Those clients include government-owned BBC, Domino's Pizza and Hyundai Kia, Havas said. "Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network's ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect," said Mr Paul Frampton, chief executive officer and country manager for Havas Media Group UK. Google made US$7.8 billion (S$11 billion) in advertising revenue in Britain last year, accounting for 8.6 per cent of the company's total sales. Later, the parent company Havas said it would not take any action outside Britain, and called its British unit's decision "a temporary move". The decision to pull advertisements from Google followed a Times of London investigation that revealed ads from many large companies and the British government appeared alongside content from the likes of American white nationalist David Duke and pastor Steven Anderson, who had praised the killing of 49 people in an Orlando gay nightclub in June last year. Google made US$7.8 billion (S$11 billion) in advertising revenue in Britain last year, accounting for 8.6 per cent of the company's total sales. The boycott signals a growing backlash against so-called programmatic trading, which automates the buying and selling of advertising online, and social media providers that are seen to not be doing enough to tackle hate disseminated on their platforms. Media-buying firms are also increasingly resentful of the power wielded by Google and Facebook, claiming that the two companies operate a global duopoly over online advertising. Mr Ronan Harris, Google's United Kingdom managing director, said in the blog post that the company removed nearly two billion offensive ads from its platforms last year and also blacklisted 100,000 publishers from its ad sense programme. The company will now review its policies and said it would be making changes "in the coming weeks" to help customers stop their ads from appearing on objectionable websites or against offensive videos, Mr Harris said.

The company also uses hiring panels, including many of its employees, to interview applicants.PHOTO: THE UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG PublishedMar 20, 2017, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/47PQ Copy In the third of a four-part series on the future of work, Google's vice-president for staffing and operations Sunil Chandra talks about what employers look for when scouting for the best talents from around the world. Sandra Davie Senior Education Correspondent sandra@sph.com.sg Singaporean Muhammad Mohsin admits to being awed by the work environment and staff perks provided by his employer Google, when he started work as a software engineer at Mountain View, California, four years ago. Who wouldn't - with perks like stock options, massage rooms, nap pods, laundry services and hairdressers, and mechanics for your car on site? If you didn't have a car, there were commuting shuttles with Wi-Fi on board. The numerous restaurants, cafes, juice bars, microkitchens and pantries appear to confirm the rumoured "150-feet rule" that stipulates no "Googler" should be farther than this distance from a food outlet. He has also received and awarded "peer bonuses", where Googlers can arrange for the company to pay surprise bonuses - to show appreciation to a colleague who went beyond the call of duty. BIO Mr Sunil Chandra, vice-president of staffing and operations at Google, leads the team responsible for all of Google's hiring, outreach programmes and operations. The team is responsible for finding the best talents for Google - from university campuses through to experienced candidates with deep domain expertise. The operations teams are responsible for making sure that Google's people processes run like clockwork across all offices and teams. The business intelligence and reporting teams bring the data that informs recruitment and staff development. Prior to joining Google, Mr Chandra was the chief operating officer for technology at Barclays Capital, where he helped build the global services group in Singapore, and director of administration at McKinsey & Co. He has a computer engineering degree from the University of Wollongong and an MBA from the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia. But what drew the Singapore Management University (SMU) graduate to Google, and still excites him, goes beyond perks. "You get to work with really smart, driven people. And despite being so smart, they are always ready to help - what we call 'Googleyness'. "Plus, and this is a big plus - you get to do really interesting work," says the 34-year-old, who set up two start-ups developing phone applications after graduating from SMU with an information systems management degree. He had tried for a job at Google as a fresh graduate, but got a call only three years later after Google saw a mobile game he had developed and put online. He is a member of the team working on G Board, the keyboard that lets users search and send information, GIFs, emojis and more, as they type. The office culture and impressive staff perks helped Google nab the top spot in Fortune's annual list of the 100 best companies to work for - again - just two weeks ago. The company, which employs 72,000 people worldwide, including 1,000 in Singapore, has been named the top workplace for the sixth straight year. It's the eighth time in 11 years that Google has topped the list. So, how does one land a job with the world's best employer? Will top grades and a degree from a top university help one stand out from the two million to three million who apply for a job at Google every year? Google's vice-president for staffing and operations Sunil Chandra gives a firm "No". He says Google has used data analytics for years to figure out how to hire people with the right fit. "There is no correlation between our good hires and the universities that they come from or their GPAs," says the Australian-trained engineer, quickly adding that he is not encouraging anyone aiming for a job at Google to drop out of college. He explains further: "Just because you did well in university, it does not mean that you are intellectually curious and you have skills and passion to produce great products, which is what Google is looking for." What about the impossibly difficult and punishing brain teasers that Google is famous for? The company once plastered a maths equation on a billboard that read: “{first 10-digit prime found in consecutive digits e}.com.”  Other teasers include:“How many aeroplanes are in the sky right now?” and “How many golf balls would fit inside a 747?”  According to Mr Chandra, teasers are a waste of time. “If you are an interviewer, they are a fun thing to ask. But there is actually no correlation to the hiring outcome.”  He goes on to what it is that Google looks for. Ability is important, though it is not academic ability that the company looks for, but problem-solving ability.  He explains: “The problems and the context will keep changing, but what Google looks for is the right attitude and ability to decode problems and solve them.”  The second thing that the hirers look for is role-related – essentially, whether you have the skills required to do the job. “So if you’re an engineer, can you code? If you are aiming for a sales position, can you come up with some effective sales strategies?” Third is leadership. Mr Chandra explains: “If you are a more senior person,we want to know if you have created great teams. If you are just starting off in your career, are you the kind of person who finds a problem and says, ‘I’m going to solve it.’ “So you could be in school or university and you say, ‘you know what, I don’t know why these cords are always hanging loose, I’m going to clean them up myself.’ “That’s taking charge and leading. “It’s a natural desire to want to make a difference and to be able to inspire other folk to come along with you. It’s innate leadership versus leadership that is granted because this is your position.” He stresses that this quality is important,because the tech giant wants its employees “to look at things we do, the way we do them and tell us how we can do it better”.  The final thing is the “Googleyness” that Mr Muhammad referred to – a combination of passion and drive and being a good team player. To find this, Mr Chandra says they look for people who work well in teams and have innate curiosity.  “Are you someone who just wants to know more about stuff? You have to be very curious about what else is possible, knowing that everything will change.” Google used to conduct many interviews before deciding on a person, but through analytics, the company has determined that after four interviews, they do not achieve a much greater degree of confidence about whether the interviewee is a good fit for a position. As a result, they have capped the number of interviews that they will put a candidate through. He also reveals that Google uses hiring panels, including many of its employees, to interview applicants. To date, Mr Muhammad has been part of more than 100 interview panels. “Hiring is pretty much part of everyone’s job,” says Mr Chandra. He also highlights the importance of diversity. “We have done multiple studies that show us that we build better products by having teams that come from different backgrounds with different perspectives.  “It makes sense as our users come from a wide variety of backgrounds and if we don’t represent our users, there’s no way for us to build great products.” Any advice for young people aspiring to work for great companies like Google? They must use their time in university well, he says.  “Discover who you are,what you’re excited about. Don’t focus on just one thing for the three or four years and do stuff. If you’re really fascinated by computers, write some code, build an app. If you’re really excited by cooking, go to cooking classes. If you really want to help others, join a volunteer organisation,because employers are interested in the whole person, not just in your degree.” He admits that Google uses an inordinate amount of resources and people in recruiting and developing the right talents. He says one great employee is worth a lot to the company. “We are in an age where a single person with a huge amount of passion and skills can go create apps and products that are used by billions of people. “That is the kind of person that all employers, including Google, look for – one with the right skills, talent and drive. “It’s good to go to university to gain knowledge, but what counts at the end of the day is what you can do with what you know.” A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on March 20, 2017, with the headline 'How to land a job in Google'.

Of all the DMCA requests copyright holders sent, roughly 40% were rejected due to inaccuracies or abuse. Most interesting, perhaps, is that Google processes more Wordpress.com takedowns than WordPress itself. Automattic, the company behind the popular WordPress.com blogging platform, receives thousands of takedown requests from rightsholders. A few days ago the company published its latest transparency report, showing that they processed 5,006 requests during the second half of last year. While this is a significant amount, it pales in comparison to many other user-generated services. Google, for example, receives the same number in less than four minutes. What’s also different is the high rejection rate WordPress has. More than 40% of all DMCA takedown notices are rejected due to inaccuracies or abuse, more than many other service providers. Overall, however, both the number of takedown requests and the removal rate are relatively stable. As can be seen below, Automattic generally removes content for just over half of the notices it receives; the rest are rejected. When we took a closer look at the takedown numbers, comparing them to Google’s data, something else stood out. It appears that Google receives more takedown requests for WordPress.com than Automattic, the company that operates the blogging platform. Over the past 12 months, copyright holders asked Google to remove over 13,100 WordPress.com URLs, while Automattic received less than 10,000 last year. In other words, copyright holders are more keen to remove the search engine results than the actual content, which is not very logical. TorrentFreak contacted Steve from Automattic, who says that the numbers suggest that rightsholders prefer to go through Google because this is the easier path. “Those numbers aren’t entirely surprising for a few reasons. When looking to limit access to material online, complainants will naturally look for the path of least resistance,” Steve says. “Since we manually scrutinize every single DMCA takedown notice that we receive for formal validity and fair use considerations, removal is not guaranteed, and we reject about 40% of all notices for being deficient in some way,” he adds. The Google takedown process is highly automated which makes it relatively easy for copyright holders to target a high volume of URLs, including those of WordPress.com. “Removing sites from top search engines is often much easier due to the automatic nature of the review process… something that is made even easier still by the various trusted partnership programs, and use of bulk electronic takedown notices,” Steve notes. Still, it’s a strange situation. If a copyright holder is really concerned about infringing content on WordPress.com, it should be at least worth a shot to ask the company to remove it. But no, of the top ten reporting organizations that asked Google to remove WordPress URLs, none appears in Automattic’s most recent top ten. Finally, it appears that the thousands of notices that are sent to the search engine are pretty much useless anyway. It may be easier than reaching out to Automattic, but not very effective since Google appears to have whitelisted the blogging platform. Of the 13,100 takedown requests Google processed over the past 12 months, only 0.3% were ultimately removed.

Name: Subject: Message: 10 best Google Daydream apps Apps & Gamesby Joe Hindy4 days ago 5 276 14 Google Daydream is Google’s newest VR platform. It’s only been around for a few months and only a few devices can use it. You’ll have a better experience than you would with Google Cardboard. However, we’re still waiting for the app market to populate more. It’s still early, but some apps are already pretty decent. Here are the best Google Daydream apps! Got Cardboard? Here are the best VR apps and games!   15 best VR games for Google Cardboard1 week ago   10 best VR apps for Google Cardboard1 week ago Coloring VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Coloring VR is one of the more relaxing Daydream apps. Like most coloring book apps, you'll be able to pick one of a variety of images and then color them in. It's not overly complex but it makes up for it by doing what it can do pretty well. You can look around, zoom in and out, and, of course, color stuff. That's about all that it does. It's completely free to download for now. It has enough code to show that it has in-app purchases, but it doesn't actually have any yet. It's worth a shot at least! DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Fulldive VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Fulldive does a lot of things for a VR app. It bills itself is a VR social platform that introduces you to all kinds of other VR content. That's all good and everything, but that's not what makes it one of the must try Daydream apps. It has the capacity to stream 360, 3D, and other VR content from YouTube. You can also play your locally stored VR videos and photos. Perhaps its best feature is the ability to browse for other VR apps and games. Not all of them will have Daydream support, but it's a good place to start. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Google Photos Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY As it turns out, Google Photos is actually also a Google Daydream app. On your device, it's a great app to backup photos and videos. On Daydream, it's a good place to view all of that stuff. It has support for 360-degree photos, panoramas (of a certain size), and VR photos. It's a free app that most people should have on their smartphones anyway. Thus, it makes sense to pick it up for use for Daydream. It's completely free to download and use. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY NBA VR and NFL VR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Both the NBA and the NFL have both released Daydream apps. Unfortunately, they're not fully featured apps. At least not yet. The NBA app gives you access to a lot of tertiary content. You'll be able to watch highlights, exclusive interviews, and stuff like that. The NFL VR app does essentially the same thing. Both are very fun VR experiences. However, we look forward to the day when you can stream live games. Until then, though, fans of (American) football or basketball should mostly enjoy these experiences. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Netflix VR, Hulu, HBO GO Price: Free (with subscriptions) DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY One of the first industries to pick up on VR was video streaming. They're still working on the experience end of it, but the apps work fairly well. You'll be able to binge stuff like you always do from the comfort of a VR living room. Hulu rolled their VR approach into the official app while Netflix and HBO GO have separate VR apps that you'll need to search for. They all still require the same old subscriptions which helps keep things simple. They're not flawless experiences by any means, but it's one of the funner ways to use VR right now. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY How about a little augmented reality?   10 best augmented reality games and AR games for Android2 weeks ago   10 best augmented reality apps and AR apps for Android2 weeks ago myVR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY myVR is a personalization app. It's also a fun way to experience VR. You'll be given your own personal space that you can customize. It also lets you add sources such as YouTube channels, websites, music sources, and other stuff. That way you can stay up on news, videos, and music that you like. Additionally, you can visit other people and view their little spaces if you want to. It's nothing too amazing, but it's a fun way to experience VR. It's definitely one of the must-try Daydream apps. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY RaveVR Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY RaveVR is a video platform that helps you find VR video content. It connects to a variety of websites such as YouTube, Reddit, Vimeo, and Viki. You'll be able to search through and watch some VR stuff as it comes out. It also has a text and voice chat built-in that lets you connect with other people, watch videos together, and chit chat. The only downside is that you'll need to log in using your Facebook account. Some won't like that and we don't blame them. However, if you don't mind, then it's a fun little thing to experience. DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Skybox VR Player Price: Free DOWNLOAD ON GOOGLE PLAY Skybox VR Player is a video player for Daydream. It has surprisingly good support for most types of video. That includes 2D, 3D, 180-degree, and 360-degree video content. You can install a PC component and stream your own video content from your computer to your headset if you so choose.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Waymo looks to protect tech secrets from Uber in… Waymo looks to protect tech secrets from Uber in lawsuit over stolen tech secrets By Bill Roberson — March 17, 2017 1:34 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: There’s no fighting in the war room Happy St. Pat’s, and as Google/Alphabet’s Waymo autonomous car division squares off with Uber in lawsuit over stolen trade secrets, Alphabet officials are concerned that Uber’s lawyers, while viewing court documents, could potentially have access to even more Waymo trade secrets. The lawsuit began after Waymo hauled Uber into court, claiming a former employee left the company for Uber after downloading a lot of Waymo’s self-driving tech secrets. Nine months later, Uber had their own self-driving car effort up and running with some tech that they say looked awfully familiar to Waymo’s, and Google released the lawyers. As part of the legal process, Waymo has to tell Uber what they’re up against, and that includes documents with even more technical data on Waymo’s efforts. Waymo is trying to work some legal deals to keep their secrets secret, and Uber says that they haven’t seen any “sensitive” Waymo tech documents yet, so we’d say this whole legal drama clearly has a long, long way to go. Vista is about to get harder to see Still using Windows Vista? OK, hey, whatever works. But the problem is, Vista isn’t going to work for much longer, at least not very well, and neither will Windows 7, depending on what kind of computer you’re using. Vista is essentially going to the data heaven on April 11th, when Microsoft will terminate all support for the OS. That could leave openings for hackers and data thieves as they pry for weaknesses in the OS. Meanwhile, Microsoft is now sending prompts to users of Windows 7, letting them know whatever machine they’re using is now “unsupported hardware” – which, ironically, are new PCs, instead of old ones – and no further updates are forthcoming for them, either. Naturally, Redmond would love it if you would take the time to update to Windows 10, and they did give a heads up about this last year, so this is more of a reminder than surprise. Go here for more details on Vista and here Windows 7/8 issues. There are details in the dark We talked recently about how High Dynamic Range picture quality, also known as “HDR”, is coming to everything from TVs to computer monitors to smartphones, and now, graphics card maker Nvidia has released a behind-the-scenes 4K HDR video ahead of the release of the rebooted Mass Effect: Andromeda video game. Got a 4K TV or monitor? Then shut off the lights and check this video out. What can we say, it looks amazing. HDR technology gives video content better color, deeper blacks, more contrast and more detail than ever, and we even have a primer on why it’s the hot video tech of the moment, so check the link to learn more. Meanwhile, Mass Effect Andromeda comes out next week. We’ve got more news on our Facebook page and YouTube channel, and be sure to tune in to this week’s DT podcasts: Close to the Metal (computers and such) on Tuesday, Trends with Benefits (general tech shenanigans)  on Thursdays, and Between the Streams (movie and TV topics) every Friday.
Digital Trends LG G6 review The LG G6 sets a new standard in smartphone design Share DT Editors' Choice The LG G6 proves that big-screen phones can come in small packages.

The LG G6 proves that big-screen phones can come in small packages. It’s the best Android phone you can buy. Highs Compact, attractive body Large, beautiful screen Great pictures from the dual-lens camera Latest software with Google Assistant IP68 water resistant Lows Audio can’t match the visuals All models need Quad DAC, wireless charging, and more storage DT Editors' Rating 9.0 DT Editors' Choice Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Phone Reviews > LG G6 review By Andy Boxall Posted on 03.17.17 (updated on 03.18.17) Research Center: LG G6 Is bigger better? When it comes to the screens on our smartphones, yes. But when it comes to the body of the phone, not so much. That’s the reason we don’t all carry around a tablet every day. It’s also why so-called phablets often split opinion. The LG G6 laughs in the face of such concerns. It’s the phablet’s worst nightmare, because it puts a massive screen inside a truly compact body, redefining the genre and daring big-screen haters to get over their prejudices. It’s also LG’s follow-up to the G5, a phone that similarly attempted to redefine smartphones with its modular construction, but didn’t manage to do so. The G6 isn’t as bold or as risky as the G5, so has LG played it too safe this time? We’ve been using the phone for a week or so, and have plenty to say about it. Making the phablet manageable Many people struggle to believe the G6 has a 5.7-inch screen, because it feels so small in your hand. It’s easy to stretch your thumb across to the other side of the phone when holding it in one hand, and it remains usable at all times. Try that with any phone with a 5.5-inch screen, and it’s a struggle. More: LG G6 video teardown, and safety testing lab tour How has LG achieved this feat? It minimized the size of the bezels and chose an 18:9 aspect ratio, making it longer and thinner than the 16:9 aspect ratio screens found on most other phones. Get used to the look, as the G6 almost certainly won’t be the only 18:9 ratio phone we’ll see in 2017. The front of the G6 looks very modern, thanks to the rounded corners of the screen. It’s the screen that’s rounded, too, rather than a bezel over the top to give it the look. Combined with the rounded corners of the phone, it helps absorb impacts and lessens the likelihood of catastrophic screen damage. The thin top and bottom bezels make the screen stand out even more, and enhance the minimalist style of the phone. This is a glass and metal phone, with Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, and Gorilla Glass 5 on the back. We are worried that it will break and be expensive to replace, so we highly recommend you buy a G6 case. Flip it over, and the rear has LG’s trademark fingerprint sensor which doubles as a power button below the dual-lens camera and flash unit. Apart from a subtle G6 logo, that’s it. Our review model is platinum, which looks fantastic, and isn’t the fingerprint magnet you may expect. The phone also comes in black or white. The G6 is thicker than many phones, but not by much, and it gives you a lot more phone to hold on to. More: Keep your shiny new LG G6 safe from damage with the best cases and covers Is the G6 the perfect size and shape for a smartphone? At the moment, yes it is. It combines everything we love about big-screen phones and removes everything we hate about them. There’s no longer a reason to compromise and buy a smaller phone, and no reason to get one bigger than the G6, either. You won’t be prying the G6 out of our hands for a while. There’s a new screen shape in town Measuring 5.7 inches and boasting an impressive 2,880 × 1,440-pixel resolution, the G6 has envious screen specs; but those cool rounded edges and the overall size of the G6’s screen isn’t what makes it so special. It’s the 18:9 aspect ratio. This also equates to a 2:1 ratio, which means two perfect squares fit next to each other on it, something that LG exploits in the user interface. Why should you care about the aspect ratio? Isn’t that sort of thing just for cine-geeks? It’s actually the movie industry that may end up making-or-breaking the 18:9 screen. Some filmmakers consider it to be the happy medium between cinema and TV aspect ratios, meaning regardless of what screen a video is watched on, it will retain the same look — no cropping to fit — and stay the same as the director and cinematographer intended. More and more video is being watched on smartphones, so this is a major consideration. The LG G6 is the phablet’s worst nightmare. For now, there’s a limited amount of 18:9 content online, mostly streamed through Netflix. We watched Daredevil and Marco Polo on the G6, and both looked superb; filling the screen entirely after tapping a special button in a drop-down menu. There’s something very special about seeing a video fill the screen this way. It’s more immersive, more cinematic, and genuinely impactful. The aspect ratio isn’t the only feature that makes the video experience on the G6 special. It’s the first phone to come with both Dolby Vision and HDR 10 support. This technology previously only seen on televisions is designed to make the image more lifelike with better colors, more accurate contrast levels, and wider viewing angles. There’s not much content out there that takes advantage of it at the moment — it doesn’t make any difference to regular YouTube videos, or the operating system — so it’s only Netflix or Amazon Prime subscribers that may see the benefit. There’s also the problem with video content that’s not formatted for an 18:9 screen. That content has black bars running down the sides of the video in landscape orientation. If 18:9 video catches on like LG and others hope, this will eventually become less of a problem, but for now, you’ll have to put up with them in most cases. Size oddities aside, the G6’s display is stunning. It’s full of color, detail, and warmth, and a true pleasure to watch. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Although the screen is technically 5.7 inches in size, it doesn’t really look like any other 5.7-inch screen, and some may see the G6’s screen size as a con, due to the taller, thinner aspect ratio. For example, put the G6 alongside the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and open an app such as Twitter, and the iPhone will display more text and information on one screen than the G6. It’s still a big-screen experience, just unlike those we’re used to. Slick software and fun apps Android 7.0 Nougat is installed on the LG G6, and our pre-production review model had the March 2017 security patch installed, making it right up to date. LG’s user interface is placed over Android and has a few additions to make better use of the 18:9 aspect ratio screen. Android purists will note changes to the notification shade, the Settings menu, and the option to enable the app tray, or spread apps across multiple home screens. LG also provides various themes to match the color scheme of your G6, which change backgrounds, wallpapers, and icons. The G6 is ideally suited to multi-window app use, providing a perfect square for two apps to live in, and it’s easy to activate using a long press of the Android menu key. LG only installs a few of its own apps, such as QuickMemo+, which handily syncs with Google Drive, LG Health, a Tasks app, and its own messaging, music, file manager, and calendar apps. Additionally, there’s an FM radio app, and an audio recorder. Many of LG’s own apps make use of the 18:9 aspect ratio. The Gallery app takes up the whole screen, for example. It’s LG’s Square Camera that’s the most interesting. It splits the screen into two, with the top half for square format pictures and the lower half for previews, or custom shots. It’s a shame Square Camera’s functionality wasn’t built into the main camera app, because many people will miss it. Grid Shot works especially well. The square is broken down into quarters, each filled with a still image or a three-second video clip, which when put together tells a neat little story. There’s plenty of room for creativity here, and best of all, the result can easily be shared on Facebook or Twitter, with videos intact. This is essential, and a problem Apple hasn’t overcome with its similarly fun Live Photos feature. If you can’t share them with your friends, we question whether it’s worth it at all. Other features in Square Camera include Match Shot, which is like Grid Shot but with two pictures instead of four, and Guide Shot for matching photos using a handy transparent overlay, so people can capture the same pose or composition on multiple occasions. A long press on the home button brings up Google Assistant. The G6 is the first to use the Assistant outside of the Pixel phones, ahead of its wider release on other Android 7.0 Nougat phones. We’ve reviewed a version of the G6 that has software which is 95 percent ready for release, meaning there may be some alterations when the phone goes on sale. However, we experienced no stability or compatibility problems. More: Feel fly like a G6 with these handy tips and tricks While LG’s user interface does deviate from standard Android, it’s not unpleasant or slow. Thought and effort has been put into the icon design when you change themes, the color choices that match the body, and the icon curves that match the shape of the screen. LG’s UX 6.0 looks fantastic, and we never felt a desire to change the launcher on the G6. The G6 has up-to-date software now, and we hope that will continue in the future, but that will be down to LG’s update schedule, which unfortunately may lag behind Google’s. A wonderful wide-angle camera There are two camera lenses on the back of the G6, both with 13 megapixels. One boasts a wider-angle lens than the other. The 125-degree wide-angle lens doesn’t have optical image stabilization and it has an f/2.4 aperture, while the 71-degree standard lens has OIS and a far better f/1.8 aperture. You get two different experiences when taking pictures, especially in low light, when the standard angle lens produces pictures with more detail and less noise. However, the G6 can take some fantastic nighttime or evening shots, adding drama and atmosphere in the right environment. Used creatively, and with the right lighting, the wide-angle lens is also more than capable. LG’s UX 6.0 looks fantastic, and we never felt a desire to change the launcher. In daylight, the G6’s camera didn’t enjoy overcast days at the end of British winter time, and struggled to manage contrast — eventually settling on washing out the sky and darkening the landscape. It’s not ideal, and something we’re hoping will be cured when the final software build is released. We also found the screen itself didn’t do the photo justice, and it often ended up looking better than expected when we checked the gallery. Again, something that’s likely to change with a software update. We’re noting it here in case nothing changes. Show the camera a blue sky, colorful plants, or any close-up material, and it shines. Using the phone in Spain after the launch, we compared the G6 to several other phones including the Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus, and found it produced the best image in several different tests. Most of the time, it came very close to matching the Pixel XL, a highly rated camera phone. Taking photos with the G6 is enjoyable and addictive, and the wide-angle mode presents new creative opportunities. There’s a manual mode for both stills and video, if you’re confident enough to change settings in search of the perfect picture. LG hasn’t included an editor, though, and you’re given the choice of using Google Photos or a third-party app, such as Snapseed instead. The G6’s selfie camera has 5 megapixels and a single 100-degree, wide-angle lens, and like the main camera the two modes are alternated using a button on the screen. There are also several filters to apply, and a chance to manipulate skin tone and artificial lighting sources. While capable enough, selfies taken with the G6 can’t match those of the Huawei P10. The wide-angle lens makes it easy to take great group shots, though, and goes along way to redeeming the front cam’s ability. LG has also made good use of the extra screen in the camera app, using the top edge (or side edge in landscape) as a preview gallery, showing the last four pictures taken so you don’t have to jump into the gallery app to see them. Plenty of power and battery life The LG G6 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor inside, plus 4GB of RAM. There will be those who mumble complaints about the Snapdragon 821, whining it’s not a super-new Snapdragon 835. Don’t be one of these people. Ever used the OnePlus 3T or a Google Pixel? There’s more than enough power inside both those phones to keep them fresh for ages, and they both have the 821 inside. LG made the decision to use the 821 in order to get the phone on sale quickly, rather than over the summer, and it shouldn’t put you off at all. An AnTuTu benchmark result returned a score of 135,032, and 3DMark’s Slingshot Extreme test saw it score 2,102. These are around the same as the scores attained by the Pixel XL, but fall short of the OnePlus 3T. It’s also very close to the LG G5 and the Samsung Galaxy S7. LG G6 Compared To Meizu Pro 6 Plus Xiaomi Mi5S Plus Xiaomi Mi Mix Huawei Mate 9 ASUS Zenfone 3 Deluxe Special… HTC Bolt Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Motorola Droid Turbo 2 Huawei Nexus 6P LG V10 Motorola Moto X Style Pure Edition Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Other complaints will be made about the lack of removable battery on the G6. However, even though the G6 is now a sealed phone, that has given it an IP68 water and dust resistance rating. While having a replaceable battery is great, having to replace the entire phone after you spill a drink all over it isn’t so great. Yes, you’re trading one feature for another, but additional durability protects your purchase instantly, and there are plenty of battery packs out there to buy. When we first started using the G6, the battery life was poor, barely lasting a mid-to-heavy use day. A software update has improved the situation, where we’re seeing 25 percent of the battery remaining after the same level of use in a single day. That includes photo work, social networking, games, and navigation. Buying the G6 in the U.S. will see your phone come with wireless charging, a feature not included on international versions of the phone. Using the supplied charger and USB Type-C cable charged the 3,200mAh cell reach capacity after about an hour and 30 minutes. No Hi-Fi audio for most buyers and not enough storage Watching stunning video is what the G6 is made for, so how about the audio experience? Sadly, it falls short of the video performance. It doesn’t have stereo speakers, just a single one at the base of the phone, and there’s no Dolby Atmos, or even standard Dolby Audio tweaks. The single speaker does a decent job, but it’s overshadowed by the iPhone 7 Plus, Boomsound speakers on any HTC phone, and cheaper hardware like the ZTE Axon 7 and 7 Mini. It’s a shame, when what’s on screen looks so fantastic. The wide-angle mode presents new creative opportunities. Additionally, LG has restricted the Quad DAC to devices for sale in South Korea only. LG G6 phones sold in the United states get 32GB of internal storage and a MicroSD card slot as part of the SIM tray, but internationally, larger capacity versions will be sold. LG G6 phones in Europe have neither the Quad DAC or wireless charging. We’d much rather a single model with all these features inside. LG says the localization is based on buyer preferences, and ensures the price of the phone is kept competitive in different regions. Price, availability, and warranty LG hasn’t announced a price for the G6, but carrier partners are slowly revealing their own. Verizon will sell the G6 for $672 from March 17, with release on March 30. We expect it to be widely available elsewhere over the coming weeks. LG traditionally gives you a one-year warranty on smartphones, which covers either repair or replacement, plus any labor charges. You’ll have to send it back to LG if it goes wrong, though. Our Take Thanks to the LG G6, having a big, beautiful screen doesn’t mean enduring an oversize phone anymore, and it’s wonderful. Is there a better alternative? No. As of the time of writing, the LG G6 is the best Android phone you can currently buy. That may change once Samsung has had it’s say, but only time will tell. Based on the early price from Verizon, the G6 will cost less than $700, and around the same $650 price point as the G5. This is excellent news, especially as we’re hearing the Galaxy S8 — the G6’s natural challenger — will be up to $850. The Google Pixel XL is the obvious alternative for stock Android fans who dislike any customization. It costs $750, has a Snapdragon 821 processor, Android Nougat and Google Assistant, plus a highly capable camera. What it doesn’t have is the G6’s sleek body and gorgeous new screen, or a wide-angle camera lens. No other phone offers this combination, and although the Galaxy S8 is likely to have an 18:9 aspect ratio screen, it almost certainly won’t have the wide-angle camera. The DT Accessory Pack Olloclip Pivot $50 LG wireless headset $70 Motorola Moto 360 Sport $130 The OnePlus 3T is a strong alternative to the G6 if you want to save a lot of money. It also has a Snapdragon 821 processor, plus 6GB of RAM, and a considerably lower $440 price tag. There aren’t any camera bells and whistles, but it still takes solid shots. Finally, LG’s own V20 may be considered. It has the same size screen, similar wide-angle camera setup, a degree of durability, and the removable battery. It’s wildly expensive, though. How long will it last? LG’s G6 should have a long shelf life of at least two-to-three years. The software is right up to date, and it has Google Assistant already installed, meaning there’s no need to wait for an update. Updates in the future may take longer to arrive than on a Pixel phone, though. That’s our only concern and reservation in recommending the G6 over the Pixel XL. The processor is the only sticking point. We always like to have the latest hardware and software, because it ensures the phone will last many years if we want it to, but the Snapdragon 821 won’t remain Qualcomm’s top chip for much longer. Does it matter? Not really. It won’t suddenly stop working, and your phone won’t suddenly react like it’s pedal-powered. However, if bragging rights are your thing, it’ll soon lose out to the Snapdragon 835. That said, the 821 is tried and tested, unlike the 835. Should you buy it? Yes. The G6 is not only the first major flagship smartphone out in 2017 that we really adore, but it’s also a return to what makes us love LG phones — subtle yet beautiful design, a brilliant standout feature, and a cracking camera. The software is good, too, with Google Assistant installed rather than a third-party or untested alternative, ensuring it works cohesively throughout the phone. Best of all, it’s compact and easy to use with one hand, but offers a screen larger than its direct competitors. We love it, and think you will to.

Safari Thorin Klosowski Mar 20, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple browsers chrome downloads ios 10 ipad iphone safari Share Safari has long been the go-to browser on the iPhone, but after Apple finally opened up the secret speed enhancements in Safari to other browsers way back in iOS 8, it's now possible to ditch Safari entirely for another browser. Chrome is the most obvious choice for doing so. But is it worth it? The Contenders You have a number of browser options on iOS, but most of them, like the privacy-focused Brave, the gesture-based Dolphin, or the speed-centric Opera Mini, all fill a niche instead of trying to be your daily driver. For that, Chrome and Safari lead the pack. Here's a quick summary of their feature-set: Safari: Safari is the default browser we've all come to know so well over the years. It does everything a browser needs to do, including offering up a private browsing mode, bookmarks, and as of iOS 9, ad blocking. Safari is deeply integrated into iOS, which means you can search for something in Spotlight and open it in Safari, and by default most apps will open any links in Safari. Chrome: When Chrome originally arrived on iOS, it was slow, but still managed to work so well with Google's other products that people used it anyway. Now, the two are equally speedy. Alongside features you expect in any browser, Chrome on iOS has a few Google-specific quirks, like a built-in QR scanner, Google Now support, a translator, and more. Chrome also tends to hide a lot of its interface, foregoing the bottom navigation bar prevalent in Safari and instead placing everything up top. This is an aesthetic thing, but design matters enough that you might prefer how one works over the other. Which browser is best for you is partially a matter of preference, but it also matters what other apps you use. Let's dig into where Chrome makes more sense than Safari and vice versa. Chrome's Voice Search Works Extremely Well If you want to search for stuff online with your voice, you want to use Chrome. Google pushes its voice assistant hard in Chrome in iOS and it works stupidly well. With a hard-press of the Chrome icon you can search before even open the app, and once you're in Chrome, you'll find the voice search icon everywhere you look. More importantly, the voice search is accurate, pulling up most results perfectly. This sounds like a minor feature, but if you can't or aren't good at typing on a phone's small keyboard, having what's essentially a dictation function comes in handy. For its part, Safari has the regular old dictation button that's built into iOS, but it's not voice search specific and doesn't work as well. Of course, you can also search using Siri, but it's not as fluid or useful as the voice search in Chrome. Chrome Plays Nice With All of Google's Apps, Safari Plays Nice with Everything A while back, Apple introduced a "deep linking" feature that essentially lets apps communicate with each other. While it's not a replacement for "default" apps like on Android, it does make it so developers can do things like have a URL link from Gmail open up in Chrome instead of Safari. As you'd expect, Google has taken full advantage of this. Provided you're a Google user on a lot of services, from Drive to Gmail to Maps, you can make it so all those apps communicate with Chrome. For example, when you tap a link to a map in Chrome and it opens up Google Maps, or tap an email link in Chrome and it opens Gmail. If you're deeply invested in Google, this works wonderfully and makes it so you can ignore Safari altogether. If you're not a heavy Google user, things get less interesting. Safari is still the default browser, which means URLs you get in text messages, Apple Mail, or links you search in Spotlight all route thought through Safari. While some third-party apps, like Spark or Airmail, have an "Open in" option that lets you choose your browser, that's not the case in all apps, so you're bound to still use Safari now and again. Unless you're very much into Google, Safari is probably your best option so you don't have to bounce between the two all the time. Both Sync with Their Desktop Apps There is one final, big reason why you'd choose one browser over the other. Both Safari and Chrome sync with their desktop counterparts. This means your tabs, history, and bookmarks all sync from your phone to your desktop. If this matters to you, then you'll want to go with whichever browser you use on your computer. Personally, while syncing always seems like a cool idea, it's something I never, ever use, so this doesn't matter to me as much as I initially thought it would. If you're in the same boat and don't actually utilise this, don't let the idea that you could affect your decision for which browser to use. Safari's Reading List is Great, but Chrome Has One On the Way An often forgotten about feature in Safari is its Reading List. Here, you get a Instapaper-esque list of articles you've saved for reading later. It's great if you read a lot on your phone and have no interest in more advanced options like Pocket or Instapaper. Chrome does not offer this at all right now, but it's rumoured to be on the way soon. Until we know how that actually works, Safari is your better option here. Of course, for now, Chrome users can still use a third-party app like Pocket or Instapaper. Safari Can Block Ads and Trackers If you're someone who blocks ads or third-party trackers using an ad blocker, then your choice here is very clear: use Safari. The "content blockers" introduced in iOS 9 only support Safari, and Chrome doesn't have any similar type of plugin. These content blockers aren't about ads, they also block cookies, weird page elements, specific URLs, comments, and more. So, if you want to mess around with any of that stuff, you want to stick with Safari. The Verdict: Chrome Is Great If You're Deep In Google's Ecosystem, Safari Is Best for Everyone Else Which browser is best for you depends on a lot things, including a general preference for how it works. Some people like Chrome's more minimal aesthetic enough that features don't actually matter. Others like the fact that Safari integrates automatically without any tweaking. In any case, if you like the "feel" of one over the other, know that they're both equally speedy and feature-complete, so there's no reason to actively avoid either. The one clear difference comes if you're an avid Google product user. Chrome does an excellent job of linking up with the rest of Google's apps, enough so that you almost feel like you're not even on an iPhone. In that case, stick to Chrome and you'll be happy. If you seek out other apps that deep link to Chrome you'll be able to pretend like Safari doesn't exist. For everyone else, stick with Safari. It's come a long way over the years and it works perfectly well. Is it a little boring? Sure. But how exciting do you want your browser to be? Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Monday, March 13, 2017, 15:45 [IST] Google has rolled out an update to the Android Gboard adding GIF and emoji suggestion features as the users type using it. The update also added a handy voice-to-text command feature along with these features. The Gboard for iOS devices had these features and the Android version is catching up with its rival only now. This update offers many new features to the Android Gboard including quick translation, personalized keyboard backgrounds, voice-to-text function, etc. For now, the suggestion feature is supported only by the instant messaging apps including Snapchat, Allo, Facebook Messenger, and Hangouts. Google is expected to introduce these features to the other apps as well in the near future. With the update, the Android devices get voice typing capabilities with an upgraded UI. This lets them switch back to the usual typing mode easily. Besides these features, new keyboard themes have also been installed to various devices based on Android. These can be accessed from the Gboard settings or the Theme icon in the quick feature menu in the suggestion strip. Also Read: These Microsoft Surface Phone renders may be too futuristic Gboard for Android also supports Google Translate and the same can be accessed from the quick feature menu. Eventually, the translation tool will offer text interpretations as users type sentences in real time. For now, Android phones thrive with the right-to-left language support on Gboard for search and share features. For instance, the Farsi, Hebrew, and Arabic texts are written the other way around in comparison to normal typing. Android users can download the latest version of Gboard for Android from the Google Play Store and experience these new feature additions and improvements.

Search warrants to access metadata from an entire cell tower are becoming more and more popular, too. What isn't common though, is a search warrant for the internet history of an entire town. While this sounds like something from the "what not to do" chapter in a law textbook, it is happening right now in the town of Edina, Minnesota. A thief faxed in a fake passport to a credit union which allowed him to steal $28,500 out of a victim's bank account. Police were notified of the fraudulent transfer and discovered that the photo used on the passport could be accessed by searching Google Images for the victim's name. It doesn't show up in Yahoo or Bing searches, so police are hoping to use Google to help track down their thief. The county judge agreed with the police and granted the warrant, which was then served to Google. The warrant, if Google agrees to provide the information, allows the police to collect names, emails, account information, and IP addresses of anyone who searched for the victim's name during a five-week period. Googling someone's name isn't illegal, so privacy experts are up in arms over the potential to collect information on innocent users. Possible employers, friends, or anyone who happened to be interested in the victim during the time period in question could have their personal information handed over to the authorities. By casting such a wide net, the Edina Police Department are also opening themselves to the possibility of evidence being thrown out before a trial if it is deemed to have been obtained illegally. Google and the Police Department aren't saying much since it is an ongoing investigation, but the full can be viewed on security researcher Tony Webster's website. 9 comments 368 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Google's new reCAPTCHA is so smart, you won't even know it's there Obama's planning a coup: Google Home is sharing fake news stories Google launches first gigabit wireless home internet service Popular 46 comments Simulating AMD Ryzen 5 1600X, 1500X Gaming Performance Five Experimental Chrome Settings Worth Enabling Load Comments 9 ...

"Alexa, please buy me 30 boxes of Fruit Roll-Ups." Image: mashable By Jack Morse2017-03-16 02:22:12 UTC Amazon Echo and Google Home can make you feel like you’ve stumbled across a genie: say what you want and, like magic, it appears on your doorstep. That's both cool and convenient — until it isn't. And as the incident earlier this year where a 6-year-old girl ordered a $170 dollhouse and four pounds of cookies demonstrates, it often isn't.  SEE ALSO: Amazon Echo finally gets the one feature it should have had when it launched Kids are ingenious little creatures. Soon they'll realize getting Nintendo Switch accessories or a hot pizza delivered no longer necessitates kicking and screaming. Instead, just ask Alexa nicely.  Makers of the devices are not oblivious to the threat posed by children, and have taken small steps to protect them (the devices — not the children).  How to turn voice-activated purchases off For Amazon Echo, the first and most drastic step is to disable purchasing by voice. Notably, this feature is turned on by default, so after you register your new device, you'll want to immediately open up the Alexa app navigation panel and select "Settings" then "Voice Purchasing." You can now turn off "purchase by voice." Voilà. Potential crisis averted.  Google Home hanging out at home. Image:  LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Google Home offers the similar ability to toggle on and off what it calls "voice orders." Although, unlike with the Eco, this feature is not turned on by default. This is good news for parents who don't feel the inclination to wade through a multi-step process. If you have turned voice orders on, but are having second thoughts now that Junior has started to speak, you can disable the feature by hitting the Menu icon in the Google Home app and scrolling over to "More Settings" then "Payments." Select “Pay with your Assistant” and you have just disabled that feature.  If you still want to order stuff with your voice What if you want your kids locked out of voice ordering but still think it's a good idea to restock Easy Cheese while you lie supine on the couch?  Alexa offers you a compromise: Securing your voice orders with a four-digit password. Navigate your way back to "Voice Purchasing" and select "(Optional) Require confirmation code." Select a code, and you're all set — assuming your kids don't learn the code.  Google Home does not have a similar password-protected option. Fortunately, it does currently have some roadblocks that may slow a young one down. At present, Google Home can only order things from a specific list of Google Express retailers. That limits your angel to only buying things offered at one of those store, although Toys"R"Us is one of those stores. Also, for the time being there is a $100 limit on orders, and each order can only consist of one item. Both are little consolation, but consolation nonetheless.  Sadly, neither Amazon Echo nor Google Home offer great tools to prevent little troublemakers from having their way with the shopping list. Amazon's four-digit password is a start, but becomes more or less worthless as soon as a kid hears you use it once. Until the companies figure out a way to restrict users based on specific voices, the safest best is just to disable the feature all together.  That's right, you'll just have to use your ever-present smartphone to order your random internet junk. And hey, feel free to blame it on the kid — we won't tell.

It gives you email, a cool search engine, a fantastic Maps app and plenty of cloud storage, all for free. We also tend to forget that it's an ad company. Until an ad pops up on someone's Google Home device, anyway. Over the last couple of days, Google Home users have heard a little spot about the opening of Beauty and the Beast when they ask for a summary of the day ahead. "By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today," says, Google Home, in between spots on the weather and whatever other news stories are popular at the moment. Speaking with The Verge, Google issued two statements, one seems to suggest it is an ad despite explicitly saying it's not. They then quickly followed up with a statement that suggests it's not an ad but rather some type of algorithm deciding what content to dish out to you. Here's the first statement: This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales. And here's the second statement: This wasn't intended to be an ad. What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. Regardless of what Google says, we often seem to forget that while Google is many things, it's absolutely an ad company first. According to Adweek, Google made around 88 per cent of its revenue from ads in the second quarter of last year. Google has since pulled the not-ad from Home, and while they're denying it's an ad, it's hard to see it as anything but a test run of just that. Even if it's not and was an earnest mistake, the idea of putting personalised ads on Google Home seems like a no-brainer. To expect the company we already let mine our emails to display better ads to do anything but shove ads in our faces on all their products seems delusional. Google Home, just like the Amazon Echo, is billed as an assistant but is clearly also a means to sell you more things. In Google's case, it's also yet another way to round out your profile to advertisers. While there's no evidence either company is monitoring the microphone the same way they monitor what you do online in order to display personalised ads, I wouldn't be surprised to see that as a feature in the future. Alexa is probably a little easier to understand for most of us, as everyone assumes that a product they buy from Amazon is at least partially there to sell products on Amazon, but we tend to forget that Google is doing the same thing.

Now, a new report suggests that Google might be working with the operator to develop an affordable 4G handset for the Indian consumer market. The Hindu Business Line cites unnamed industry sources aware of the "secret" project between Google and Reliance Jio, saying that the two companies are developing an affordable smartphone with 4G capabilities exclusive to Reliance Jio's network. According to the aforementioned sources, this will not only benefit Reliance Jio in the form of increased data adoption, improvements to the quality of its service, and exposure to a larger market, but also allow Google access to a large number of potential users who are connecting to the internet for the first time. The move would also boost Google's Android One initiative to bring low-cost handsets to developing countries like India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam - a program that it later expanded to the US and European markets as well. That said, it is important to note that both the companies haven't confirmed the report as of yet, so it is important to take this piece of news with a rather large grain of salt.

Neither is paying for bandwidth to serve or receive those images. We've reported in the recent past on Google's efforts to get more detail out of small images and reduce file sizes of images and other web files. The company's Guetzli JPEG encoding algorithm improvement effort looks to have a greater immediate impact because of its ability to potentially reduce image file sizes by up to 35% at the same image quality level when compared to traditional encoders, while maintaining decoding compatibility with existing browsers. Left: original, center: libjpeg, right: Guetzli. Note the reduced artifacting in the image on the right compared to the center image. Guetzli is the product of Google Research Europe, and has been released under the Apache open source license. The development team says the overall approach is similar to the one used in Google's earlier Zopfli algotithm used to compress gzip files and PNG images, and shares little with the RAISR and WebP methods that require "ecosystem changes for compression gains at internet scale," a fancy way of saying they're new formats and need big changes to server and browser software. Left: original, center: libjpeg, right: Guetzli. Again, note the difference in artifacting between the center and rightmost images. JPEG compression has several steps, including color space transformation, discrete cosine transformation, and quantization. According to the Guetzli developers, quantization is the key step where visual quality loss is traded for compression efficiency. Google says Guetzli uses a search algorithm to reduce the difference betweem JPEG's psychovisual modeling and the algorithm's own psychovisual model, which it says "approximates color perception and visual masking in a more detailed way." The result is more detail with smaller file sizes, at a cost of substantially higher resource utilization at compression time. Google says Guetzli can produce smaller file sizes with the same level of quality. The company performed experiments where images of equal file size were shown to study participants who consistently prefered the imaged compressed using Guetzli. It's worth noting that even though the encoding process is slower, that should have a relatively small real-world on servers since image downloads vastly outnumber uploads, where the processing takes place. A new JPEG compression algorithm doesn't sound as exciting as a method of enhancing small images like fictional forensics investigators in television shows do all the time, but the ability to reduce file sizes without requiring updates to browsers is probably more useful, particularly in the near future. The developers close their notes with wishes that others will pick up the baton and apply the techniques to other image fromats and to video.

Various companies are developing self-driving car systems right now, with Google, Tesla, and Uber among the current leaders in the emerging space. And two of those companies are about to clash in a court battle that might determine the early winner of the self-driving car race. Don't Miss: Samsung has done the impossible with the Galaxy S8 Google, some would say, is in an advantageous position. It’s not a car maker, but it has developed a self-driving car project that’s probably ahead of anything in the works from bigger players in the automotive industry. But Google recently lost a key engineer who’s been working on Google’s self-driving cars for a decade. Anthony Levandowski went on to found Otto, a self-driving truck company that was acquired by Uber last year for $700 million. A few weeks ago, Waymo, which is Google’s driverless car spinoff — sued Uber for trade secret theft and patent infringement after discovering that Levandowski developed a lidar system for Uber that copies the lider setup he created for Google. Who’s right and who’s wrong? Bloomberg Businessweek has the inside story on this particular dispute, which reveals the complexities of these emerging technologies, but also their potential. Google started investigating Levandowski last summer after Uber bought Otto, and discovered he allegedly used a company laptop to copy about 14,000 design files from Waymo to a card reader, before wiping all the data from the laptop. Google, however, did not act on its findings until December 13th, when a Google employee received an email that a supplier wanted to send to Otto. In the message was a drawing of a lidar circuit board that had Otto’s name on it but looked identical to Google. Bloomberg explains that it’s a Google policy not to sue former employees for patent infringement, something engineers frequently find out about during orientation. If, however, Google does decide to move to a patent-based trial against a former employee, then it means the person has done something seriously wrong, the report says. Lidar is a component that allows cars to see their surroundings, which is obviously a key feature for self-driving cars. A multi-lens off-the-shelf sensor costs $80,000, but Google developed a single-lens lidar system that’s a lot cheaper. The report reveals that it was actually Levandowski’s lidar team that came up with the creation. Bloomberg explains that Levandowski founded two other companies before Otto that were developing self-driving car products while he was working on the same products at Google. Google eventually purchased both firms. The report also goes on to say that Google decided to let Levandowski work on his side projects, even if that meant skipping work. After one internal dispute between the engineer and his boss Chris Urmson, Levandowski skipped work for months to focus on his other projects. Levandowski butted heads with Urmson about the way Google was supposed to sell self-driving technology. Levandowski wanted each innovation (self-parking or highway pilot) to be sold when ready and retroactively fitted on commercial cars, while Urmson argued for an all-in-one solution, a car that’s able to drive itself in all conditions. Levandowski wasn’t necessarily the most popular guy inside Google. Larry Page had to appoint Urmson instead of Levandowski to lead the car team exactly because of the latter’s controversial style, which drew criticism among his peers. But the report seems to cement the idea that Levandowski was an essential Google employee, and that he’ll further influence the autonomous car market regardless of who prevails in Google’s court battle with Uber. In addition to his engineering skills and his desire to push the technology to the limits of what was possible both from a technical and legal point, the engineer also took matters into his own hands in seeking to legalize self-driving car tests. Levandowski hired a lobbyist in Nevada and wrote a law to allow companies to test autonomous cars with a human driver behind the wheel. He did so without telling Google, which found out only when the person who lobbied for the law sent the company an invoice. The law passed at the end of 2011. The full report is available at this link, and it’s definitely worth a read.

News UK Home News Banks join queue of advertisers ditching Google over extremist YouTube videos Internet giant facing mounting pressure over continued refusal to accept responsibility for content Rachel Roberts Tuesday 21 March 2017 14:16 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The internet giant is being urged to take greater responsibility for the content that appears on its platforms AFP/Getty Google is scrambling to respond to criticism after three of the UK’s biggest banks pulled their adverts from its platform after their campaigns appeared alongside extremist YouTube videos. HSBC, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) took the decision over fears some of their advertising budgets are being used to fund banned hate preachers, racists and terrorist organisations, including Isis. The banking giants’ withdrawal follows hard on the heels of multinational companies including McDonald’s, L’Oreal and Audi, a number of Government departments and media organisations including the BBC, Channel 4 and The Guardian, who have suspended adverting on Google’s search engine and its YouTube video platform. Read more UK to question Google over extremist content American giant Google, the world’s most valuable brand worth more than $109bn (£88bn), according to Forbes, has been plunged into crisis with the loss of the banks’ advertising. Google controls around 35 per cent of all online advertising, but its market dominance could be seriously compromised if other major advertisers desert the platform. Sky, Barclays and Vodafone are understood to be considering whether to cancel their campaigns unless Google is able to resolve the problem rapidly. Advertising executives have urged the company to “get its house in order” and take decisive action to dissociate the brand from extremism. Read more Havas: French ad giant 'pulls ad spend from Google and YouTube' An investigation by The Times found ads for dozens of leading firms have been shown alongside videos posted by extremists including David Duke, former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.  Numerous other racists, holocaust deniers and rape apologists have received payouts from Google for YouTube commercials.  Taxpayer-funded ads for various branches of the British Government were appearing alongside Isis propaganda videos and other offensive content. An ad appearing alongside a YouTube video earns the poster around £6 for every 1,000 clicks it generates, meaning brands have unwittingly contributed funds to extremists. Google pips Apple as world's 'most valuable' brand The issue appears to be related to the use of AdX, Google’s DoubleClick Ad Exchange Service, which uses automated trading of ads on various sites through a variety of algorithms – a process in which humans are rarely directly involved. Read more Another 100 companies pull advertising from Breitbart Internet giants including Facebook and Google have historically absolved themselves of responsibility for some of the content hosted on their platforms by insisting they are “technology companies” rather than media outlets, meaning they cannot be regulated and fined in the way that newspapers, books or magazines would be if they published the views of extremists. Sir Martin Sorrell, head of global ad agency WPP, told news site Business Insider the controversy reinforces his belief that Google, Facebook and other platforms have to admit they are media companies and face up to their responsibilities. “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” Mr Sorrell said.  “They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.” The Guardian CEO David Pemsel said in a letter to Google that many brands feel they have to place their ads on the company’s services because of the dominant position that Google, YouTube and the DoubleClick ad platform have in the marketplace. “It is therefore vital that Google, DoubleClick and YouTube uphold the highest standards in terms of openness, transparency, and measures to avoid advertising fraud and misplacement in the future,” Mr Pemsel said. “It is very clear that this is not the case at the moment.” Ronan Harris, a senior Google executive in the UK, addressed the problem in a blog post, saying the company does its best to ensure that client ads are not published alongside offensive content.  “However, with millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right,” he said. Mr Harris admitted Google needs to “do a better job of addressing the small number of inappropriately monetised videos and content,” and that the company plans to introduce more ways for customers to control how and where their ads appear.

By Megan Nisbet Sunday, March 19, 2017 The top ten most Googled baby questions revealed [Getty] There's a new mouth to feed, a nappy to change and a life to look after. But now Search Laboratory has unveiled the top ten questions expecting mothers are asking Google, and they might surprise you. On average Google receives a monthly total of 11,500 searches about unborn babies and what it takes to be a good parent. But the top secret bump questions pregnant women are eager to get answers for are shocking. Here's the 10 most common questions expecting mums are asking Google... 1. Will my baby be ginger?

Will my baby be a boy or a girl? 9. What will happen to my baby if I drink coffee? 10. What will happen to my baby if I sleep on my right side? The Google searches revealed surprising results [Search Laboratory] Questions that try to determine the baby's genetics, such as ginger hair, curly hair or whether it's a boy or a girl, simply can't be answered by Google, so we're shocked they rank so highly. And if your baby is ugly – which we highly doubt any mother would think that of her own child – there's also nothing that can be done, other than hope he or she grows out of it. However, we can have a go at answering a few others. Why is my bump so high? According to Emma's Diary you won't know whether your bump is low or high until around 28 weeks when the uterus moves higher up in the abdomen. The NHS adds that by 28 weeks your baby weighs around 1kg and is perfectly formed, taking up more space in your stomach, which can in turn cause heartburn. Expecting mums have been asking pretty strange questions [Getty] What will happen to my baby if I drink coffee? According to the NHS high levels of caffeine can result in babies having a low birth weight, which can increase the risk of health problems in later life. Too much caffeine can also cause miscarriage. It's advised to have no more than 200mg of coffee a day. What will happen to my baby if I sleep on my right side? A study in 2011 linked sleeping positions while pregnant to still-birth. According to the BBC the University of Auckland compared 155 women who had late still-births with 310 who had healthy pregnancies. They found that sleeping on the back or right side, rather than the left, doubled the risk - but only to almost four in 1,000. At the time, the NHS advised pregnant women to contact their GPs if they were worried.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Terra Bella leaves Google ! Planet, company which owns and operates fleet of miniature satellites, acquired Terra Bella from Google to enhance own services with fleet of high resolution satellites. Google sold Planet one of its main competitors on the market. Planet, which operates at the moment fleet of 60 Cubesat satellites deployed mainly from International Space Station, starts in this way new era of development. In February Company will add another 88 Cubesats deployed from Indian PSLV rocket and also take control over satellites owned by Terra Bella, known previously as Skybox. These two steps will result in increasing number of satellites operated by Planet, to over 168 in the end of the 2017. Company will operate 7 SkySat high resolution satellites, it will add them to another satellites acquired after purchasing another competitor –  5 RapidEye satellites which are operated by Blackbridge Ltd., which was purchased in 2015. It is worth to remind, that Terra Bella planned delivering to orbit 8 SkySat satellites representing second generation on the top of the Minotaur rocket in 2017. Still, Planet is not able to offer imaging services in such impressive quality like DigitalGlobe, but with their spectacular live video broadcast in high resolution is serious competitor for every company in this segment of space industry. Now with high resolution fleet owned by Terra Bella will seriously increase chances to became a leader.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION Feature How Parkopedia became a parking data powerhouse Paul Sawers@psawers March 19, 2017 7:15 AM Tags: Parkopedia, SpotHero, top-stories Above: Parkopedia for iPhone Image Credit: Paul Sawers / VentureBeat “It didn’t take a genius to realize that if I couldn’t find any useful online information for finding parking in San Francisco, then drivers in Paris, Shanghai, and thousands of other cities around the globe were probably also struggling with the exact same problem,” explained Eugene Tsyrklevich, founder and CEO of London-based parking platform Parkopedia, in an interview with VentureBeat. It was way back in 2007, during the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco, that Tsyrklevich tried to find a place to park his rental car before his arrival at the event. But after Googling for reliable parking information for the Moscone Center, he came up blank. So he left home earlier than should otherwise have been necessary and circled the block several times until he finally found somewhere to park. “That was the spark for the idea — helping drivers find somewhere to park — which I launched in 2008,” Tsyrklevich explained. Meet Eugene Eugene Tsyrklevich is a computer engineer who holds a BSc and MSc in computer science from the University of California, San Diego. He initially learned how to code in high school and went on to fund his university education by working as a software engineer at a number of tech startups during the late ’90s dotcom boom, which had exploded while he was at university. He started his first business, a consulting company specializing in computer and network security, just after the dotcom revolution went belly up in 2000. “I had the opportunity to travel the world, get paid for legally breaking into corporate networks, and to train the U.S. military in hacking — all before I graduated from university.” After graduating, Tsyrklevich continued consulting, and he went on to work in finance after moving to London in 2004. Fast-forward 10 years from that frustrating day outside the Moscone Center, and Parkopedia is now one of the biggest parking data compendiums in the world. Headquartered in London, the company describes itself as a “Wikipedia for parking,” and — through a suite of apps — serves up information on availability and pricing of parking meters, parking spaces, parking lots, and even private driveways for hire. Above: Parkopedia founder and CEO Eugene Tsyrklevich at London HQ. Image Credit: Mark Earthy Parkopedia today Much has changed at Parkopedia since the original incarnation was unveiled back in 2008, as the entire connected landscape has shifted from desktops to the pocket, with many cars now permanently online too. Moving with the times as a fledgling startup is always difficult, but when you’re completely new to an industry, things are just that little bit harder. “When I had the idea for Parkopedia, I knew nothing about the parking industry, maybe apart from how to feed a parking meter,” said Tsyrklevich. “The first version of the website, which I built myself, allowed drivers to find parking lots in San Diego and San Francisco. Within months, we expanded to London and Sydney, and we have carried on adding cities ever since.” Though Parkopedia is a consumer-facing service in its own right, claiming around three million monthly users, it’s not a household name like Uber, Google Maps, or some other transport-focused services. But it has achieved scale by powering countless third-party services from major global brands. Today, Parkopedia says that it serves more than 6,000 cities across 75 countries. In 2015, GM subsidiary OnStar launched AtYourService, a new “commerce and engagement” product that connects drivers with merchants during drives — serving up information and offers related to their route and destination, including hotels and places to eat. Parkopedia was one of the launch partners, used by OnStar to give subscribers in North America and Europe a “premium parking service” that includes dynamic space availability. This week, the duo renewed their deal, which will extend the partnership by another three years. Back in 2011, Parkopedia added Garmin to its Roster of clients, powering the GPS tech giant’s navigation devices with such data as real-time parking space availability. This was followed a year later by a global deal to power BMW’s in-car parking information service. Last July saw what was arguably Parkopedia’s pièce de résistance when the company inked a global deal with Apple to power parking information in Apple Maps. And shortly after that, Parkopedia entered an agreement with TomTom to provide data to its own automotive customers, followed by Audi China a few months later. Throw into the mix Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover, Peugeot, Toyota, and Volvo, and you start to get an idea of Parkopedia’s reach. “With the continued growth of Parkopedia’s coverage, as well as explosion of connected devices and cars, Parkopedia grew rapidly and now works with most car manufacturers globally,” explained Tsyrklevich. Show me the money What’s perhaps most notable, in this age of unicorns and failed tech IPOs, is that Parkopedia has yet to take on a single dime of venture capital. Moreover, the company says that it’s profitable, making enough money through licensing its services to its business customers and funding everything from its cash flow. “When we were starting out, we did consider taking on VC investment and pitched to a number of firms,” said Tsyrklevich. “However, we didn’t raise any VC investment and ended up bootstrapping to profitability.” Whenever a major client is announced, says Tsyrklevich, his company gets a lot of interest from VCs, but he isn’t interested at the moment. “Being profitable and funding our growth and product portfolio development organically, we are currently not actively looking for money,” he said. “This may change in the future with potential acquisitions or entry into new markets.” Parking in the digital age Above: Parkopedia iPhone app: San Francisco parking Image Credit: Paul Sawers / VentureBeat If you’re the sort of person who just shows up at your destination, fingers crossed, hoping to find a parking space, then here’s a quick recap of what kinds of parking data is typically found in Parkopedia and similar services. First up, there’s dynamic, real-time information on available spaces in barriered parking lots — this data is garnered directly from the companies that operate the parking facilities and is complemented by “static” data, which covers such variables as prices, opening hours, and location. But Parkopedia also manually checks much of this data. “On top of the extensive industry network that Parkopedia has built out, we physically re-verify all of the data by deploying field teams globally,” said Tsyrklevich. “This requires significant investment, but that’s the cost of delivering a highly accurate service that is expected of us by our premium brand customers.” In other words, Parkopedia can’t afford to take the data it receives at face value. Additionally, Parkopedia serves up static data for on-street parking in 500 cities around the world, while also providing some real-time availability for on-street parking where sensors are installed. For example, in the City of Westminster, London, Parkopedia receives sensor data from Smart Parking, which provides information about unoccupied on-street parking bays in the city center. Above: Smart Parking Sensor Image Credit: Smart Parking This is an expensive and labor-intensive initiative to scale globally, however, and getting cities to invest in smart sensor technology is a hard sell. “Some cities, such as Los Angeles, London, Shenzhen, and Barcelona, have rolled out sensors in their cities, at least in core business district areas, but they are the exception, despite sensor technology being around since 2007,” continued Tsyrklevich. Given the inherent challenge of garnering real-time data for on-street parking, Parkopedia has been investing in algorithms to predict when spaces may be available where there is no physical counting infrastructure. Back in September 2015, Parkopedia announced a partnership with Garmin, which became the first company to use Parkopedia’s predictive parking smarts, starting in a handful of cities across Germany. Rather than relying on sensors or other expensive hardware, it analyses historical data garnered from cars that already have Parkopedia integrated. It’s not perfect, but it claims around 80 to 90 percent accuracy. Above: Parkopedia’s predictive parking in Garmin (PRNewsFoto/Parkopedia) It’s actually not too dissimilar, in concept at least, to a predictive parking feature that was recently introduced into Google Maps in a handful of U.S. markets. Google collects the data in much the same way it obtains data for its Popular Times feature in Google Search: by aggregating anonymized data from Android users who have “Location History” activated on their device. While Google’s parking feature is no doubt useful to have, it doesn’t quite hold the same sway as Parkopedia’s predictions, because Google doesn’t know for sure whether the parking is legitimate, and the app lacks other fundamental data points, such as pricing and hours of operation. Parkopedia currently employs more than 60 people across its hubs in London, San Diego, and Beijing, and Tsyrklevich says the fastest-growing area for the company right now is its data science division. This burgeoning team includes PhD scientists with backgrounds in robotics, computer vision, and computer science who are working on “statistical models” — among other future-gazing projects — to garner accurate parking availability predictions. Since the predictive parking feature’s initial rollout in Germany’s five largest cities 18 months ago, Parkopedia has signed more deals that have given it access to additional car activity data, and it’s now available in around one hundred cities across Europe and North America, according to Tsyrklevich. “We now process hundreds of millions of data points every single day to figure out parking space availability,” he said. Parking data landscape Above: Parkopedia for iPhone Parkopedia isn’t alone in the parking data / service provision realm. Other notable players include Chicago-based SpotHero, which has raised around $28 million in funding since its inception in 2011 and which connect garages, lots, and valets with car owners across the U.S. Then there’s fellow Chicago-based ParkWhiz, which has nabbed $36 million in venture capital funding since 2006, but again it only operates in the U.S. Parkopedia has local competitors in most major markets, with some offering in-app bookings and payments, while others serve more as information and data providers. Though Parkopedia enables parking reservations for some off-street parking facilities, actual payments can only be made in-car (on-street and off-street), with Parkopedia opening to payments for the first time back in 2014 when it signed a deal with Volvo. Where Parkopedia seeks to stand out from the crowd is by being a truly global parking service provider that covers nearly every facet of the parking spectrum. Perhaps its closest competitor, from a global standpoint at least, is ParkMe, which was acquired by real-time traffic data provider INRIX back in 2015. “Global organizations such as Apple, BMW, Garmin, and so on have a strong preference to work with a single provider who can provide them with global parking coverage, consistently high data quality, and transactional capabilities,” said Tsyrklevich. Another area in which Parkopedia is looking to stand out from the competition is through embracing the fledgling self-driving car industry. The future, according to Parkopedia Above: Parkopedia London HQ Image Credit: Mark Earthy With its in-house army of scientists, Parkopedia is in the early stages of building a system that uses the car itself as the sensor, rather than relying on in-ground sensors, something that would make garnering real-time parking data for streets easier to scale. “The cars act as ‘eyes’ on the road, reporting information to us extracted from their built-in sensors, such as cameras, for example,” said Tsyrklevich, giving a rough outline of what the fledgling technology entails. But what’s perhaps most interesting at Parkopedia in the near-term is that it’s forging ahead with plans to infiltrate the fast-growing autonomous vehicle movement. A day doesn’t go by without the burgeoning self-driving car industry hitting the headlines, and flying cars are now entering the fray too. But amidst all the hullabaloo of self-guiding cars traversing busy highways and local conurbations, it’s easy to forget that the rise of autonomous vehicles also presents an interesting opportunity for companies such as Parkopedia. Back in January, the company announced a project it had been working on with Volkswagen’s research group that involves building parking technology and services for autonomous vehicles. Part of the work included creating high-definition autonomous driving (HAD) maps of multi-storey parking facilities across Germany. The maps enable vehicles to position themselves while driving indoors “with a precision of one centimeter” without relying on GPS connectivity, according to Parkopedia, and while navigating in fully automated mode. “The self-parking car of the future will need excellent data to find the right parking spot, transaction capabilities to book and/or pay for it, and indoor navigation capabilities,” said Parkopedia’s COO, Dr. Hans Puvogel, at the time. The road to self-driving cars becoming a reality around the world will be peppered with incremental advances — baby steps, if you will — whereby more advanced features will be introduced in stages. For example, carmakers such as Honda have been working on automated valet parking (AVP) systems for a few years already, letting drivers drop their car off and having strategically positioned cameras take over to enable the car to park itself — and return when the driver wants it. Many cars are already equipped with features like cameras and sensors to help drivers park with precision. And with city congestion and limited parking expected to worsen, the smart parking assistance market is predicted to rise to $5.25 billion by 2021, up from $2.13 billion in 2015, according to a recent report. Put simply, parking is playing a pivotal part in the race to bring automated vehicles to market, and Parkopedia wants to be at the forefront of the movement. Juxtaposing the Parkopedia of 2008 with the company today reveals as much about the broader technological shift in society as it does about Parkopedia’s evolution. “If someone told me 10 years ago that Parkopedia will be running on a supercomputer in your pocket, employ a team of PhD data scientists crunching hundreds of million of data points every day in a cloud, and would be powering autonomous vehicles, I would not have believed it,” said Tsyrklevich.

Pull the AC power cord. Depending upon what you watch on your so-called "smart" TV, disable its WiFi and/or disconnect its ethernet cable. Obviously, that won't work if you watch programming via the internet. Everything is a trade-off. Many of the latest "smart" features require two-way communications. It is bad enough that many TV manufacturers spy on your viewing habits and sell the information to companies that compile data for advertisers. It seems that the government not only can access your viewing habits, but also use the microphone built into your TV or remote control (or in some cases, the speaker in your TV) to eavesdrop as well. You're trapped. Many of the applications (apps) on your smartphone report back to their providers about how you are using your phone. You give them permission in order to enable convenience features. All of the new digital assistants such as Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google constantly track you and record every query and command. Their originators store this data on servers to be parsed and analyzed for whatever purpose Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google desire. As said in another era, "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch." Even if you turn off your phone, most models still communicate with the nearest cell tower. The only way to make your phone totally invisible is to remove the battery, which is impossible on 95 percent of today's phones. Or you could buy or very cheaply construct a small Faraday cage that blocks all radio signals. Most infuriating is Alphabet's Nest home thermostat. It knows whether you're home or away, records your temperature settings and numerous other environmental factors, and sends the information back to Alphabet's parent, Google, to sell. Once a month, I receive an email with a chart of my heating/cooling energy usage and how it compares with other Nest users. So I called Nest and asked it not to collect data on me. Nest informed me in no uncertain terms that it would be happy to do so, but it would turn my $250 Nest thermostat into a basic dumb unit equivalent to any $20 thermostat you could buy at the home improvement store. This agreement was not printed on the box. Perhaps you don't mind companies and possibly the government tracking your every move. You may consider it a fair trade for free or enhanced services. I admit to allowing Google to know my whereabouts in return for Google Maps route guidance and traffic information. I'd rather pay for the service with the agreement that Google would not store any information concerning my travels. More on the death of vehicle CD players A reader concurred with the column on the disappearance of CD players from vehicles: "Good article on the death of CD players. I bought a RAM Rebel last summer. It never occurred to me to check on whether or not it had a CD player. I just assumed it did. Bad assumption. I'd driven it for two weeks before moving my stack of CDs to the console and selecting one to play. I couldn't find the slot, and the manual was no help, so I called the salesman and asked where they'd hidden it. 'Oh, nobody uses those anymore, so your truck doesn't have one. You have satellite instead, for one year free.' 'OK,' I said, 'I'll give it a shot.' I did, and if I hadn't paid so much for the vehicle, I'd seriously give Sirius/XM two barrels of shot, 12 gauge grade — all they do is talk, talk, talk and play stuff I don't like. I hate having no choices anymore other than those they allow me to have. So I rarely use it, tuning in the regular radio instead, which I don't like either for the same reasons as above. At least it's free." Rich Warren, who lives in the Champaign area, is a longtime reviewer of consumer electronics. He can be emailed at hifiguy@mchsi.com.

We sometimes cover impressive concept designs to tantalize us while we wait for the launches, while some creations are of unknown devices. Today we’re looking at the iPhone 8 vs Huawei P X vs Google Pixel 2 in a concept clash. We’d like to hear which of these designs you think is best. Leaks and rumors about the iPhone 8 vs Google Pixel 2 and other upcoming devices have been plentiful. However, until they are officially unveiled we won’t know for sure what’s in store. Concept ideas can give us ideas in the meantime and we have three to share today. The new iPhones 2017 have not been officially titled yet and different names such as the iPhone 7S, iPhone 8, or iPhone X are among those rumored. We’ve already seen plenty of iPhone 8 concepts and this new one comes from Gabor Balogh for TechDesigns. You can see it in full in the video that we’ve embedded below. The phone is dubbed the iPhone 8 /X and is tagged ‘A Touch of Life.’ It’s a good-looking metallic handset but no specs have been provided so you’ll have to use your imagination. The next design is the Huawei P X designed by Michael Muleba. There’s no video for this one so we’ve included a couple of images showing the handset. It’s a glossy looking sleek smartphone that has been imagined as a Huawei P10 alternative with an edge-to-edge display. It comes in either a metal or matte finish in a choice of colors and features include quick charging and an iris scanner. The designer has given it a 24-megapixel rear camera with Carl Zeiss optics. We think plenty of readers will admire the styling of this vision. Finally we get to the Google Pixel 2 concept that is shown in full in the second video below and in the image above. It was created by TechConfigurations and has a premium glass and metal build with nicely crafted touches, especially around the edges of the handset and for the curved back. This design also comes with imagined specs such as a Snapdragon 835 chipset, a 5.7-inch display with QHD resolution. It has 4GB and 6GB RAM variants with either 64GB or 128GB of internal memory. This Google Pixel 2 concept includes a 16-megapixel rear camera with dual LED dual tone flash and, 12-megapixel front-facing camera, Features include a fingerprint scanner on the reverse and fast charging. There are front-firing stereo speakers and it’s also dust and water-resistant to IP67 standard. When you’ve checked out all three designs it would be good to hear your views of this iPhone 8 vs Huawei P X vs Google Pixel 2 concept battle. We have our own favorite but we want to hear yours, so do drop us a comment in the usual way.

Google Chrome's version 57 aims to prolong battery life. MANILA, Philippines – The world's most popular browser, Google Chrome, will now consume less energy and less processing power with an update that limits the activity of unused tabs. Opening multiple tabs is a common habit among computer users today. However, the habit can take its toll on battery life and the computer's performance. Chrome, for all its benefits, can be resource-intensive and simultaneously opened tabs can add to the problem. To address this, the latest version of Google Chrome, Chrome 57, now monitors how much processing power a background tab takes from the CPU. If the background tab consumes more than 1% of the CPU's power, the tab's activities are throttled back until it hits the 1% limit. Through this method, Google said it is able to achieve "25% fewer busy background tabs," meaning less strain on the processor and in turn, less strain on the battery. Gizmodo reports, however, that there are a few exceptions to the new throttling policy. Chrome will not stop background music from playing as well as video chat apps and messaging apps such as Slack. Chrome's previous throttling policy monitored how often processes run from a background tab instead of measuring processor consumption. In the future, Google said the ideal solution is for background tab activity to be suspended completely, and to develop new ways for the processing of these background tasks – all in the aim of prolonging battery life. Software-side improvements go hand in hand with the search for higher-capacity batteries as tech and mobile devices march toward an untethered existence.

But the real action is about to take place in the courtroom.  Google and Uber, the two giants at the forefront of developing the technology, are vying to own the emerging market and to suck up the profits. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 140.64 -0.83 -0.59% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▼ 55.31 -0.02 -0.04% Cousins Properties Inc CUZ = 8.11 0.00 0.00% LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE LVMUY ▲ 43.14 +0.30 +0.70% The stakes are high and the fight is already getting personal, with Google accusing one of its star engineers of stealing some of its crown jewels.  Last month, Waymo, the self-driving company owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, sued Uber, claiming that one of its employees stole vital technology shortly before starting his own self-driving company (which Uber later acquired). Autonomous cars have the potential to upend massive industries ranging from transportation to auto manufacturing. For Google and Uber, the opportunity and the threat posed by a world of self-driving vehicles is huge. Google has been developing self-driving technology for the better part of a decade, and plans to license that technology to other car companies through Waymo. There's also a chance Waymo will eventually develop its own ride-hailing service powered by self-driving cars to compete directly with Uber. Uber only recently began exploring self-driving technology, but sees it as the next logical step to protect its business. One of the company's biggest expenses comes from giving drivers a share of the revenue generated on each ride. Cutting out the drivers in favor of self-driving cars would be huge for Uber's bottom line. (And, of course, bad for the drivers who rely on Uber to make a living.) If someone else beats Uber to that self-driving future, Uber will be at a major, perhaps fatal, disadvantage. The trade secrets case is shaping up to be one of the most significant and closely-watched battles in Silicon Valley in years, pitting two of the world's most powerful companies, and former partners, against each other. There's still a long way to go before it's resolved, but here's everything you need to know about what's happened so far. Who's involved? © Provided by Business Insider Inc google waymo Waymo. Last year, Google's self-driving car project spun out of X, the Alphabet division that dreams up "moonshot" projects like internet balloons and delivery drones. The new company is called Waymo and licenses its technology to other car companies that want to build self-driving cars. Waymo has already partnered with Fiat Chrysler. Uber. Uber, the ride-hailing company valued at $69 billion in the private market, is developing self-driving cars, which it believes will one day replace most of its human drivers. Anthony Levandowski. Levandowski is Uber's self-driving car boss. He was a top executive in Google's self-driving car division and left in 2016 to start Otto, a self-driving truck startup. Otto. Otto was bought by Uber last year, a bet by Uber on self-driving cars as well as an effort by the company to expand into the logistics business with self-driving cargo trucks. Waymo's claims Waymo accuses Uber and Otto of stealing its lidar technology. Lidar is the sensor on self-driving cars that allow them to "see" the world as they drive themselves. It's an essential component for self-driving vehicles. Waymo's lawsuit says that Levandowski downloaded 9.7 gigabytes of files containing information about the company's self-driving technology to his laptop and then transferred those files to another external storage device. Those files included plans for Waymo's proprietary lidar system, Waymo says. Levandowski left Google's self-driving division in January of 2016, weeks after downloading the files, Waymo says. He later went on to start Otto, which Uber bought six months later. Levandowski became the head of Uber's self-driving efforts. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Travis Kalanick Anthony Levandowski Waymo says it was accidentally sent an email from one of Uber/Otto's suppliers for lidar equipment late in 2016. The lidar designs in the email "bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique lidar design," Waymo says. This caused Waymo to investigate Levandowski's final weeks at Uber and the company says it discovered evidence that he downloaded the files to the external device. In addition to the lawsuit it filed in February, Waymo asked a judge last week to put a ban on Uber's self-driving car projects until the case is resolved. Uber's defense Uber hasn't issued a formal, legal response to Waymo's lawsuit yet, though it is expected to in the coming weeks. However, according to a Bloomberg report published Thursday, we have an idea one of Uber's potential defenses. According to the report, Levandowski told his staff that Uber's lidar technology is "clean" and that he downloaded those files to his computer so that he could work from home. Uber has only called Waymo's accusations a "baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." Alphabet's ties to Uber There's another piece to the puzzle. Alphabet has made significant investments in Uber. In a strange way, Uber's success also financially benefits Alphabet. In 2013, Google Ventures (now simply called GV), invested $258 million in Uber. That investment, which had Uber valued at $3.5 billion at the time, gave GV about a 7% stake in the company, Kara Swisher reported at the time, writing for AllThingsD. Uber is now valued at approximately $69 billion, according to most estimates. An Alphabet executive, David Drummond, also used to be on Uber's board, but left in August of 2016 once it became clear the two companies were competing in the same space. © Provided by Business Insider Inc david drummond What's next? The next major development will be Uber's legal filing responding to Waymo's lawsuit. The judge in the case has given Uber until April 7 to file, but Uber's lawyer said it's coming within the next two weeks. So far, we don't know much about how Uber will respond, but it seems likely it'll want to use Levandowski's defense that he downloaded the files to his computer so he could work from home.

Microsoft's Open Compute-inspired servers on display at the Open Compute Summit in Santa Clara in March 2017 (Photo: Yevgeniy Sverdlik) DCK, Featured Top Five Data Center Stories: Week of March 18 by Data Center Knowledge  on March 19, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Here are the top stories that appeared on Data Center Knowledge this week: Why Microsoft Says ARM Chips Can Replace Half of Its Data Center Muscle – This was not an announcement like the ones we’ve heard in the past from Facebook and Google – non-committal revelations that they had been testing ARM servers here and there, and that they were really always testing everything on the market, just in case. Meet Microsoft, the New Face of Open Source Data Center Hardware – If you’re running a cloud platform at Microsoft’s scale (30-plus regions around the world, with multiple data centers per region) and you want it to run on the best data center hardware, you typically design it yourself. But what if there are ideas out there — outside of your company’s bubble — that can make it even better? Google Opens a New Front in Cloud Price Wars – By constantly growing the scale of their data center infrastructure, cloud giants are able to continue lowering prices of their services as they battle for share of the enterprise cloud market. At the Google Cloud Next conference earlier this month in San Francisco Google launched the latest attack in this battle, which at least for now has a good shot at being successful. Atlanta Data Center Market Firing on All Cylinders – The demand for data center space leased from third-party landlords appears to be growing across all segments there, including: colocation and interconnection, enterprise outsourcing, cloud and hybrid IT solutions.

Mohamed Al Hammadi / Crown Prince Court - Abu Dhabi Data scientists are central to the new economy Kent Walker March 19, 2017 Updated: March 19, 2017 04:57 PM Related Abu Dhabi Crown Prince addresses future generations’ majlis - in pictures Sheikh Abdullah addresses Mohammed bin Zayed Majlis for Future Generations - in pictures Abu Dhabi Crown Prince meets ruling families of different emirates Related Abu Dhabi Crown Prince addresses future generations’ majlis - in pictures Sheikh Abdullah addresses Mohammed bin Zayed Majlis for Future Generations - in pictures Abu Dhabi Crown Prince meets ruling families of different emirates I grew up in Silicon Valley where my family settled generations ago and my grandfather worked on a farm and as a machinist. Today, at Google, I spend my workdays writing, speaking and meeting people. My grandfather would not recognise what I do as a job. For him, it would have been a holiday. We should ask ourselves: what will our grandchildren do that we will not recognise as jobs? Two hundred years ago, 97 per cent of people worked in the fields. Then many moved to factories and then to offices. And change continues today with growing use of industrial automation and artificial intelligence. Just as industrialisation changed agriculture and industry, artificial intelligence and machine learning are starting to change office jobs and automating routine tasks. Google’s approach to machine learning is driven by a belief that the benefits of technology should accrue to everyone. The internet has been "the great equaliser". It distributed access to technology and created a frictionless marketplace that empowered both consumers and new companies. With costs continuing to decline, more people around the world now have access to mobile phones than to decent sanitation. Today, a kid in Al Ain using a search engine has the same access to information as the chancellor of Germany or the president of France. On a larger scale, cloud-based services have made advanced IT offerings easier to scale and purchase on demand – making information processing an affordable utility like water or electricity. Now Google is integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning into most of our products: whether you are using Search or YouTube or Translate or Maps you are benefiting from a wealth of machine learning. This widespread access to internet connectivity plus essentially unlimited computing power have, with the acceleration of machine learning and artificial intelligence, led to profound business transformations shaping the future of work. Already, we have jobs such as data scientists in fields that didn’t exist 20 years ago. It would be foolish to think that what we do today represents the end of the process. But it takes an act of imagination to envision the future. With the advent of ATMs in the 1980s, people thought that there would be no more bank tellers. In fact, there are more bank tellers now than there were in 1980. They just do more sophisticated things like helping clients with financial planning and new kinds of services. It’s a great example of how technology displaces tasks, not jobs. A recent survey found that the "best job in the US" in 2017 was that of mobile apps developer – a job that did not exist a few years ago. Software engineers will help design the future of medicine, infrastructure, finance, transportation, stock markets and maybe even music and art. Philosophy, history and the humanities will always be important as we chart this new path. But so will computer science and programming. A recent study by Google shows that computer science and programming skills are critical to the UAE's digital economy plans. At the heart of every organisation, there will be need to be data scientists who understand how to program the business for success. Beyond educational change, cultures need to evolve as well. It seems counter-intuitive, but you want young people to take a chance on a cool new thing, not just hope for a safe job with the government or a large company. You need to promote a culture of risk and reward, and a legal system that accepts that sometimes people will try and fail. No other place in the world has witnessed more failures than Silicon Valley. These failures constitute the fertiliser that led a subsequent generation of Silicon Valley start-ups to create perhaps more value than any other place in history. The governments in this region can adopt other policies that will directly contribute to the rise of the knowledge economy and benefit both businesses and citizens. Promoting a start-up ecosystem, letting successful companies share economic rewards with their employees, avoiding red tape, burdensome licensing rules and limits on trade, and giving ready access to government data can all help entrepreneurs grow new markets. I feel fortunate to be living in a time when technology has the potential to fundamentally improve the way people work, learn and live – no matter who they are, where they are or what they do. History has shown us that technological progress leads to greater prosperity, more jobs, safer workplaces and higher standards of living. It’s up to all of us – tech companies, governments, business and citizens – to work together to create the conditions that allow innovation to flourish. The UAE has been a leader in many aspects in the region. Social and economic developments that would have seemed hard to imagine 50 years ago are today a reality through vision and a relentless desire to achieve results. But more than ever before, governments must prepare for the future. Technological change means that leaders must constantly re-evaluate how to foster the right policy environment. We look to the UAE to rise to the challenge to become as much of a regional and global leader in the hyper-connected digital age as it has been in the bricks-and-mortar economy.

Robert Epstein, a former editor in chief of Psychology Today and co-founder of a behavioral research institute in California, has won several converts through a series of experiments since first raising his concerns in 2013. Though Google has challenged his research, Epstein’s latest initiative includes the public support of 12 academics in four countries, from institutions as Stanford University, the University of Maryland and the University of Amsterdam. The global monitoring system Epstein envisions, called the Sunlight Society, would involve people from various nations conducting searches and transmitting the resulting rankings and links to a central office, where they could be analyzed for signs of bias. This would resemble a system that Epstein and several colleagues used to track alleged bias throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, during which they recruited 95 monitors in 24 states who ultimately captured more than 13,000 sets of search rankings and the 98,000 pages to which they linked. In that election, Epstein said searches related to the election were more likely to produce links to web pages offering a favorable impression of Hillary Clinton than of Donald Trump. Epstein, who is trying to raise $2 million to support the project, offered no evidence of intentional manipulation. He said the goal of the Sunlight Society was “to detect, to study and to expose new technologies that threaten human freedom.” Three of the 12 academics publicly supporting the Sunlight Society, when contacted by The Washington Post, said they were uncertain about the sources of bias but favored creating a group for studying the issue because search engines had become dominant sources of online information. Results often vary from person to person based on location and other factors, often including browser and search history. “One of the questions we are still grappling with is, where is the bias coming from?” said one of Epstein’s supporters, Natali Helberger, a professor of information law at the University of Amsterdam. “Part of this bias is probably in ourselves.” Google dismissed Epstein’s research as “nothing more than a poorly constructed conspiracy theory.” “We have never re-ranked search results on any topic (including elections) to manipulate political sentiment,” the company said in the statement to The Washington Post. “Moreover, we do not make any ranking tweaks that are specific to elections or political candidates, period. We always strive to provide our users with the most accurate, relevant answers to their queries.” Microsoft, which operates the Bing search engine, and Yahoo declined to comment. The importance of search rankings — and especially their order as they appear on the screen of a device — is well established when it comes to how consumers select online shopping offers, websites or news stories. Epstein summarized research into the impact of search results on political behavior in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015. University of Maryland law professor Frank Pasquale, who in 2007 publicly raised the possibility of a “Federal Search Commission” to monitor the increasingly powerful effects of search engines, said a monitoring group is a valuable step. “It’s part of an ecosystem of accountability,” said Pasquale, who is a public supporter of Epstein’s project. Dennis Allison, a lecturer at Stanford’s Computer Systems Laboratory and a supporter of Epstein’s project, also called the study of bias in new technologies important. “The source of that bias has not been established as far as I can see but likely is present,” he said.

The Google powered video streaming platform has rolled the new mobile live streaming feature to creators with more than 10,000 subscribers. Creators who have a subscriber base less than 10k will also get the feature soon. The live streaming feature is built right into the YouTube mobile app. To start streaming a video, users just need to open the YouTube app, hit the capture button to start recording the video that will go live for their subscriber base. Google blog mentioned that the streamed videos will have all the same features as regular YouTube videos. As noted, the live streaming of video through computers was first available in the year 2011. Photo Credit: Giphy Besides, to help creators earn revenue from live streaming, the video streaming platform has also launched Super Chat, a live stream monetization tool available to creators in more than 20 countries and viewers in more than 40 countries. SEE ALSO: Bored of YouTube? Here are a few alternative video streaming sites Google says that Super Chat lets any fan watching a live stream stand out from the crowd and get a creator's attention by purchasing chat messages that are highlighted in bright colors and stay pinned to the top of the chat window for up to five hours. It's a pretty neat idea that will give viewers a chance to add a little visual flair to their chats and at the same time will allow creators to keep connected to their fans while earning a little money. It is worth mentioning that Google has slowed down live chat during the video stream on the YouTube Mobile app as receiving 2,000 messages per second is little too fast. Besides, Google blog also mentions that the team has worked on improving streaming quality across a wider range of devices. YouTube's Mobile Live streaming app will compete with the Facebook's popular live feature that allows users to stream live videos on their time-line. Whereas the Super chat feature is Google's take on Twitter's Periscope.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Google Could Release a Third Phone This Year – Rumored to Be Bigger Than Pixel XL By Rafia Shaikh Mar 15, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit (Concept image) Device may release along with Pixel and Pixel XL successors later this year Whoa, Google! Yes, we all wanted you to start making your own phones, but three Pixel “phones” already? Well, it’s Google, after all. Yesterday, a report from the folks at 9to5google suggested that it was “confirmed” that Google was using “walleye” and “muskie” as codenames for the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2, respectively. Following this, a new report published today not only corroborates these codenames but also adds that Google is working on a third phone and it’s not the Google Pixel 2. A bigger Google Pixel 2 or a more ambitious, premium phone? A new report claims that Google is now working on a third device under codename “taimen”. The report was published by Droid-Life, saying that this information comes from “multiple sources”. However, no other details are available at the moment. Related Nokia and HMD Global Aims to Release All Android Devices in 120 Markets Simultaneously Now, Google is fond of aquatic life and has always been taking inspiration from the water to codename its devices. A simple Google Image search shows that taimen is quite a huge fish – by huge, we mean it was shown to be carried by at least two people in most of the images. Advertisement The size of the fish may actually hint that the third Pixel phone is going to be larger than the Pixel XL. While you may think that this could be a tablet, Droid-Life’s sources are adamant that this is indeed a “phone”. Considering how big Pixel XL is, taimen could move to the 6-inch category, similar to Nexus 6 which – on a side, but relevant note – was codenamed Shamu, another fat fish. Related Could Apple Reveal an Accessory That Transforms Both iPhone and iPad Into a Functional Notebook? Right now, with no more details except for the codename, it is unclear whether taimen will be just a larger sibling of Google Pixel 2 or a completely new phone, with its own unique branding. As more rumors start to pour in, we would hopefully get to know if taimen is something more premium than the upcoming Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. For now, all we know is that the Mountain View search giant is working on a third device, at least according to this one report. We will share more updates on this, but don’t forget to share with us if you’ll be interested in a bigger and probably more expensive Google Pixel successor?
