 Twitter stock plunges 19% on report that Google and Disney won't make a bid Biz Carson Oct. 6, 2016, 9:52 AM 17,949 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Images Twitter stock plunged 19% on Thursday morning following reports that neither Google nor Disney will pursue a formal bid for the social network. Sources cited by Recode's Kara Swisher and Kurt Wagner say Google does not plan to make a bid and was not moving forward with any effort to do so. Apple making an acquisition offer was also "unlikely," according to Recode. Twitter has told potential acquirers that it wants to conclude selling negotiations by its third quarter earnings report on October 27, according to sources cited by Reuters. Google was one of the top names on the potential acquirer list, along with Salesforce and Disney. Twitter stock rose early on Wednesday on a Wall Street Journal report that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff considered the company to be an "unpolished jewel." It closed up 5.74% on Wednesday, but took a nosedive in after-hours trading and Thursday morning on the reports that Google was out of the running. Google Despite the talk of the acquisition, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has remained steadfast in his desire to keep it an independent company. According to people familiar with the matter who spoke with Bloomberg's Sarah Frier, Dorsey was opposed to selling Twitter as recently as September 8, when Twitter held a board meeting to discuss the company's future. According to the Bloomberg article, there isn't a consensus within the company as to what should happen in the coming weeks and months. Dorsey wants Twitter to "remain on its current course and work to capitalize on recent product improvements and success in streaming live video," according to Bloomberg.

Sure it was a little rude, but at least it gave Apple fans something to do while all eyes were focused on Google. We already showed you how to install iOS 10.1 beta 2 on your iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have a developer account, and it’s ridiculously easy to do. Some people prefer to keep things legit though, and luckily the wait between Apple’s developer beta releases and its public beta releases isn’t long at all. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 blind camera test: Guess which model hardcore Apple fans picked Apple on Wednesday released the latest beta version of its iOS 10.1 software, iOS 10.1 public beta 2. The new build is packed full of bug fixes, and you’ll also find refinements as well as a few new features. What’s more, iPhone 7 Plus users who install iOS 10.1 public beta 2 will gain access to Apple’s Portrait Mode feature, which uses the 7 Plus’ dual lens camera to create a bokeh effect on photographs so that they look similar to photos captured using a high-quality DSLR camera.

AUSMEPA’s project, the Port Emissions Portal, addresses the current lack of essential ship emissions data for the shipping industry. Utilising satellite tracking and a big data approach, the platform will enable ports and their stakeholders to measure air quality and changing air patterns throughout the port environs. “AUSMEPA’s clear mandate is to protect Australia’s maritime environment, and one of the biggest challenges we are facing is climate change. This is not just a local issue, however action has to start at a local level. With shipping’s exclusion from the COP21 global agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, we are taking a leading role in providing the industry with effective solutions” said AUSMEPA Chairman, Capt Warwick Norman. Starting in Australia and scaling up to over 170 countries, AUSMEPA’s port emissions portal plans to connect over 3,000 ports and improve the knowledge of air emissions associated with shipping activities in port. As part of an international community of MEPAs (Marine Environment Protection Associations) Capt Norman said AUSMEPA’s plan was to work with their international counterparts to provide a locally-initiated, global solution to shipping’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. AUSMEPA could be one of four organisations to receive a $750,000 grant to further to assist in developing the port emissions portal. The six additional finalists will receive $250,000.A judging panel will select three winners, and a fourth will be selected based on public voting, which is open from 4 – 25 October via www.go.co/australiachallenge. Alan Noble, Google Australia’s Director of Engineering, said “We know good ideas combined with technology can help to solve some of the world’s biggest challenges. Ten Australian non-for-profits have been selected as finalists in the latest round of the Google Impact Challenge for their outstanding ideas to use technology to make an impact on important causes. ”AUSMEPA are encouraging all maritime industry stakeholders around the world to support their initiative and vote for increased transparency and improved knowledge of air emissions caused by shipping activity in ports:www.go.co/australiachallenge.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google Wifi might be the company’s cool new router, but OnHub owners won’t be abandoned. It turns out that Google is going all out to get Google Wifi and OnHub working in unison, making it easy to combine the old and new routers into a single Wi-Fi network. Google Wifi will be controlled using the same “Google On” app originally released to manage your OnHub router, according to an email several OnHub owners on staff received. OnHub towers should also blend seamlessly into the mesh network created by Google Wifi. Your various Google routers will automatically link together to spread wireless internet across your home. Google Wifi offers a few other nice perks, including easy controls to manage which devices have access to the internet. That could be great for parents who want to limit how much time their kids spend online. OnHub offers some smart features as well, including the option to prioritize service to a specific device, seamless security updates and support for IFTTT. Google Wifi is set to launch in December for $129 each. A bundle of three will cost $299. Google is still selling a few different OnHub models for $199 each, but it’s probably worth holding off for Google Wifi at this point.

By Jason Cipriani | October 5, 2016 -- 20:20 GMT (13:20 PDT) | Topic: Mobility (Image: James Martin/CNET) Google on Tuesday declared itself a hardware company, unveiling its own Wi-Fi product, a new Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Daydream View, and two new phones. Why pay a premium when every phone runs the same apps? When you start talking about a $400 to $600 difference in price, the mystique and perceived advantages of a brand and OS platform starts to look a bit silly. Read More There's little doubt that Google's newest smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, are tempting. Both devices are designed and built by Google and include some features you won't find on other Android devices, including the Nexus line (for the time being). However, there's a downside to Google's new hardware initiative: the price. Gone are the days of inexpensive Nexus phones, maxing out around $500. Google's Pixel line starts at $649 and max out at $869, depending on model and storage amount. For someone looking for a capable Android phone on a budget, let me present you with the OnePlus 3 and Axon 7. Both of these devices are loaded with features and far less expensive than the Pixel line. Below is a chart comparing the specifications of each device: Spec OnePlus 3 Axon 7 Pixel/Pixel XL Display 5.5-inch 1080p Full HD 5.5-inch Quad HD 5-inch Full HD/5.5-inch Quad HD Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Memory 6GB 4GB 4GB Storage 64GB 64GB 32GB or 128GB Expandable Storage No Yes No Camera 16-megapixel rear/8-megapixel front 20-megapixel rear/8-megapixel front 12.3-megapixel rear/8-megapixel front Operating System Android 6.0 Marshmallow Android 6.0 Marshmallow Android 7.1 Nougat Daydream Ready No Yes Yes Battery 3,000mAh 3,250mAh 2,770mAh/3,450mAh Dimensions 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm 151.7 x 75 x 7.9mm 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm/154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm Price $399 $399 $649/$769 32GB. $749/$869 for 128GB. The OnePlus 3 and Axon 7 are respectable devices in their own right, with the Axon 7 having a slight advantage over the OnePlus 3 thanks to its QHD display and Daydream compatibility (pending a software update from ZTE). Performance wise, it's hard to say exactly how much faster the Snapdragon 821 processor or what camera performance is like on the Pixel. Google really talked up the Pixel's camera performance, touting DxOMark's rating of the Pixel camera as earning the highest score for mobile camera ever. But, as we've seen in the past, when Google has touted Nexus camera performance as finally competing with the likes of Samsung and Apple, we were let down. Until we have units and are able to thoroughly test Google's boasting, we can't directly compare the Pixel, OnePlus 3, and Axon 7. On the spec sheet, at least, all three of these devices are comparable to one another. With the biggest difference between them being the amount of money you have to spend, and for some, that's more than enough to stay away from Google's latest wares.

The unit, which will retail for $129—a full $50 less than the Amazon Echo—when it is available on Friday, November 4, will surely benefit from being so darned cute: While the Echo has a dark, Darth Vader-esque aesthetic (of which this editor is a fan), Google Home units are the lovable Star Wars droids of the smart home world, and the look is likely to win over at least some smart home skeptics. Fans of design will likely also dig the ability to switch out the speaker grilles along the base of the unit, which come in seven colors, and the overall sleek, unobtrusive look of the units. While voice activation is the favored mode of interacting with smart home stuff these days, the top of a Google Home device is also touch sensitive, and you can interact with it in that way, too, should talking at your technology still be an uncanny sensation for you. Like the Echo, Google Home offers an all-in-one system for checking the weather, cueing up music, listening to the radio, interfacing with your home’s heating and cooling system (as long as its connected to a Nest smart thermostat), and more. Already have a few smart home products? Google Home comes out of the box compatible with Nest products, Philips Hue bulbs, and, naturally, Google Chromecast. In a piece earlier this year, published right after Google announced that it was entering the smart home fray, our sister site the Verge pointed out that Google Home is actually compatible with fewer products You can find a snazzy full review of Google Home over at our sister site, the Verge, as well as more intel on the Amazon Echo/Google Home divide.

How does it stack up against Samsung's finest? The Nexus is dead, long live the Pixel! That's right: Google is no longer outsourcing its handsets to LG and Huawei. And its first two offerings – the Pixel and Pixel XL – look like being the stuff of smartphone dreams, albeit expensive dreams. But where does that leave 2016's other big hitters? In terms of glowing reviews and strong sales, it's hard to look past the Samsung Galaxy S7. Is Samsung's flagship going to be crushed by Google? Let's find out… Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Design Both the Pixel and the Galaxy S7 are pricey smartphones, and if that kind of expenditure makes you feel uneasy, you can at least comfort yourself with one thing: you'll get a good looking device.   Both handsets are a beautiful combination of metal and glass and are in the same ballpark size wise, at 5in and 5.1in respectively. While the Samsung Galaxy comes in black, gold, white, silver or rose gold, Google gently prods at the pomposity of rival manufacturers' grandiose colour titles with the more straightforward “quite black”, “very silver” and “really blue”. Two more things to note from the outside. Firstly both phones have fingerprint security, but they're located in totally different places. While Samsung opts for home button security on the S7, Google is placing theirs on the back of the handset – so it's a question of whether you prefer to unlock with your thumb or your index finger. Secondly, Google incorporates a USB Type C charging port into their handset, while Samsung sticks with micro USB – probably for the last time, given the Note 7 has abandoned it. Whether this is a win for either depends on whether you value the faster speeds of the newer port over the convenience of micro USB cables being literally everywhere. Me? I can't decide overall, so I'm calling this one a draw. WINNER: DRAW Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Screen Thankfully, this category is a little more clear cut… at least on paper, anyway. I should caveat this section by saying that there's more to screen quality than just resolution, and our review will get to the bottom of screen quality when we can put the Pixel properly through its paces. That said, on paper, Samsung clearly has the upper hand here. As mentioned above, the Galaxy S7's screen is marginally (0.1in) bigger than the Pixel's, but the resolution difference is huge: 1,440 x 2,560 to Google's 1,080 x 1,920. That means that while the S7 is packing 557 pixels per inch, the Pixel has just 424. Now it's important not to overstate that, given most people will find a 1080p display fine on a screen of that size – hell, most of our TV sets are still 1080p and we cope fine with those. However, if you're interested in VR – either with the Samsung Galaxy Gear VR or Google's upcoming Daydream – then this stuff matters a lot more. In short: virtual reality involves having a screen magnified very close to your eyes, and under this kind of scrutiny, every pixel matters. That means that this round goes decisively to Samsung unless Google really manages to surprise us when we get our review Pixels in. But given Samsung make some of the best screens in the business, colour me doubtful. WINNER: Samsung Galaxy S7 Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Performance Performance is quite a bit stickier, and requires a little bit more speculation. This is complicated by the Samsung Galaxy 7's chipset varying, depending on where you bought it. If you bought it in the UK, your chipset will be Samsung's own octa core 2.3GHz Exynos 8890 chip, but if you're reading this in America, you'll have a nippy quad core 2.15GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. That's the same chip found in the HTC 10, LG G5 and OnePlus 3, so it's no slouch either. The Google Pixel gets a slight boost on the latter chipset, packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor that promises a 10% boost on its predecessor. As we haven't had any handsets with this chipset in yet, it's hard to validate these claims, but it's likely the Pixel will be very snappy indeed. Image 3 of 5 Both handsets are backed up with 4GB RAM, so a dead-heat there. If I were a betting man, I'd give the Google Pixel the slight edge: not just because of the advances of the Snapdragon chipset, but because Google hardware combined with Google software is a recipe for buttery-smooth operation. But we won't know for sure until we get one down in the labs. WINNER: Google Pixel Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Battery This is another section where it's impossible to say for sure. We could look at the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Google Pixel batteries side by side and say objectively that the S7's is larger. And that's true: it's 3,000mAh to 2,770mAh – but it doesn't tell the full story. There are two reasons to think that day to day use will see the Google Pixel bettering the Samsung Galaxy S7's already strong battery life: resolution and software. The resolution one is simple: all those extra pixels in the Samsung Galaxy S7 have to be powered, so whenever your screen is on, the battery is working harder than the Google Pixel's. Software is a little bit more speculation based, but basically the argument goes like this: Google makes Android, and therefore any hardware it makes can naturally take advantage of the (newer) version of the operating system. Given the Google Pixel uses a newer version of the S7's (American) chip, it's very likely that it'll have similar, if not slightly better, battery life. But as this is speculation for the moment, I'll hedge my bets. WINNER: DRAW Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Android version I briefly mentioned Android there, and the advantage Google has by creating both the hardware and the software. Historically, Nexus devices have been first in line for Android updates and security fixes, unencumbered by the need to ensure device compatibility or carrier approval. This continues with the Google Pixel, which ships with Android N from its release date in November. The Samsung Galaxy S7, however, is stuck on Android Marshmallow, with no current ETA on that sweet Android Nougat patch. Historically, Samsung isn't the fastest to update their myriad handsets, so we're betting on spring 2017. Either way, the S7 doesn't have Android N right now, so Google wins out of the box. WINNER: GOOGLE PIXEL Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Verdict   It's always hard to judge a phone that we haven't been able to thoroughly test yet – and especially when it's made by Google, who know a thing or two about getting the most out of Android, but anyone sitting on the fence between the two handsets should feel confident in biting the bullet and purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S7 now. Not only does it have a higher resolution screen and similar specifications, but it's considerably cheaper. I'd be very surprised if the difference in specs manifests itself in a dramatic leap forwards. There are reasons to hang on for the Google Pixel, of course – especially if you're the kind of person who wants the latest version of Android first. It's also going to be the first phone to run Google Daydream – the company's dedicated virtual reality application. It requires dedicated hardware, so the S7 will never get it – although it does, of course, have the Gear VR if you want to get hands on with virtual worlds. It's likely you won't be disappointed with either, but we won't know for sure until we get our Google Pixel in for review – so keep an eye out over the coming weeks for our full, in-depth assessment closer to release.

Baker and Jessica Toonkel Oct 5 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, according to people familiar with the matter. The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company's future as quickly as possible. Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people said this week. Salesforce.com Inc is in the running, while Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Walt Disney Co have also been contemplating bids, the people added. Recode reported on Wednesday, citing sources it did not identify, that Google would not move forward with a bid to acquire Twitter. It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the Reuters sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment. With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. The company missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook Inc's Instagram and Snapchat. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as chief executive more than a year ago, has been part of Disney's board since 2013. Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO, but have been on a steady downward trajectory since. (Reporting by Liana B.

Richard Lawler , @Rjcc 10.01.16 in Robots Comments 2540 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Google Research It seems like we hear about a new breakthrough using machine learning nearly every day, but it's not easy. In order to fine-tune algorithms that recognize and predict patterns in data, you need to feed them massive amounts of already-tagged information to test and learn from. For researchers, that's where two recently-released archives from Google will come in. Joining other high-quality datasets, Open Images and YouTube8-M provide millions of annotated links for researchers to train their processes on. The Open Images set comes from a collaboration between Google, Carnegie Mellon and Cornell, with 9 million entries that were tagged by computers first before having those notes verified and corrected by humans. The Google Research team says it has enough images to train a neural network "from scratch," so if you'd like to try your hand at a DeepDream-style project, better version of Google Photos or the next Prisma then it's ready to go. Announcing YouTube-8M: A Large and Diverse Labeled Video Dataset for Video Understanding Research - https://t.co/kxLUxGpLxU pic.twitter.com/J6n6TyIwLb— Google Research (@googleresearch) September 28, 2016 On the other hand, the YouTube8-M file points to 8 million videos (adding up to more than 500,000 hours of footage) that the group says "represents a significant increase in scale and diversity compared to existing video datasets." The idea here is to create a library for video analysis that rivals those already in existence for still images, that's also accessible for people without big data. Part of that is because Google has also extracted and tagged still images from the videos for researchers to download. Whether you're working on the next self-driving car AI or something simpler, you can browse or download the database right here.

While the search giant has been among the buyers considered most likely to be a contender for the social communications company, those familiar with the deal said that the company was not moving forward with an effort to buy it at this time. In addition, several sources Recode has spoken to this week also said that Apple was unlikely to be one of the possible suitors, with one saying Twitter should have “low expectations” of getting an offer from the tech giant. Update: Disney, which had also considered a bid, is not going to make an offer, according to sources familiar with that company. That should tamp down the frenzied speculation around a possible Twitter sale since Salesforce began no-commenting noisily with regard to possible interest in acquiring it a few weeks ago. The news set in motion a series of ever more breathless reports of bankers being hired and a bidding process being started. Much of this is due to said bankers trying to gin up excitement around a sale of Twitter, creating as much interest as possible to spike up the price. After all, it can’t be just Salesforce’s Marc Benioff running around flashing wads of cash! Still, let’s be clear: The process of selling Twitter is happening, as has been much reported. While Salesforce has indeed been the most aggressive possible buyer, Disney has also been mulling a bid (though Peter Kafka thinks it is a dumb move), along with a range of other players in telecom, media and private equity. And why not take a gander, given the huge trove of data that Twitter sits atop globally and its unique worldwide digital distribution system? While company execs have been unable to grow the business, many think a link with a larger entity would spur Twitter’s potential. That’s why there was much hubbub around a recent report that Google had tapped Lazard to look at a Twitter bid. (Wheee! They hired a banker! In reality, the investment bank is Google’s longtime M&A adviser on retainer and looks at every possible deal for it.) By the way, a lack of a Twitter bid by Google or Apple probably raises the likelihood that you are never going to see one from Facebook either. To be fair, Google buying Twitter does make some sense, and its decision not to bid is somewhat surprising, given the search giant has been viewed as the most likely acquirer for more than a year. As we wrote just last month, Google has never been successful at its attempts around social, and many believe Twitter could serve as both a distribution arm but also an improved social layer for Google-owned YouTube amid increased competition in the world of mobile video from both Facebook and Snapchat. Still, passing on Twitter doesn't mean Google is giving up on consumer communications altogether. The company recently released two new apps — a FaceTime-like video app called Duo and an artificially intelligent messaging app called Allo — that represent its latest attempt at getting a foothold in the world of mobile messaging, where the company is already very far behind. And Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also staked out growth in the cloud business as a key focus. Twitter, we would imagine, is a bit of a distraction and also comes with many regulatory and consumer headaches (Hello, trolls! Hello, Donald Trump!). It is much the same for Apple, said sources, noting that the focus there remains on its flagship consumer products and not on social networks. While Twitter’s foray into mobile video distribution is compelling, sources note that Apple can benefit from that without owning or managing it. And, of course, paying upward of $20 billion for it. No comments all around, of course. Update: Twitter investors are sad that Google is out of the running. The stock is down more than 9 percent in after-hours trading on the news.

One day after the company introduced two Pixel-branded flagship smartphones, each with very non-Nexus price tags, it has confirmed that the first Google Project Tango phone will go on sale in November. According to CNET, which spoke to Clay Bavor, head of VR at Google, the 6.4-inch Lenovo Phab2 Pro, which comes loaded with Tango's depth-sensing 3D camera system in order to scan the world around you and deliver an augmented reality experience (whether that's play games, navigate indoors, or see how furniture fits in your home) is finally ready. The phone was originally suppose to launch in the summer but had been delayed to autumn. The Phab2 Pro should cost around $499 unlocked in the US (about £345 in the UK). Keep in mind this device won't work with Google's Daydream View, as only the new Google Pixel phones are compatible with the VR headset. When Lenovo unveiled the phone last summer, it said PhabPro 2 would be sold globally, though in the US, it will be exclusively sold in the colours champagne gold and gunmetal grey at select Lowe’s stores and online toward the end of the year. The phone will arrive running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. It also has a 4,050mAh battery and Dolby Atmos audio capabilities. What is Google Tango?

The Korean electronics giant said Wednesday it is buying Viv, a San Jose-based startup created by Siri co-founder Dag Kittlaus. Neither company would talk about the financial terms, but all 30 or so Viv employees will be joining Samsung, Kittlaus told Recode. Samsung said it isn’t approaching artificial intelligence as broadly as Google or Apple. “Our focus is really more device-centric,” Samsung mobile unit CTO Injong Rhee said in an interview. “How do we revolutionize how users interact with our devices and our appliances?” Rhee said it is an area that Samsung is investing more in and said the first fruits should show up in next year’s flagship Galaxy phones, with future plans to integrate the technology into televisions and other Internet-connected gear. Viv’s approach, Kittlaus said, focuses on the idea that the best artificial intelligence systems will need to work in an open way with thousands of partners, operating more like Wikipedia than today’s more closed automated assistants. While Samsung doesn’t have the best historical track record of integrating software and service companies, Rhee pointed to the recent purchases of LoopPay and SmartThings as showing that the company can successfully bring outside services into the company. Kittlaus said he became satisfied in recent months that Samsung was the right partner. “We, of course, did our own independent inquiries about this issue,” he said. “Samsung has drastically changed in terms of how they handle acquisitions and integrations over the last three years and really gotten good.” The deal was led by Samsung’s Global Innovation Center, the unit run by former Google executive David Eun and also the group behind the $200 million SmartThings deal. Here is Kittlaus talking about Viv at TechCrunch Disrupt in May. recode_divider More From Recode Here’s the secret to Starry Internet’s plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly Full transcript: Recode’s April Glaser talks drones on Too Embarrassed to Ask Recode Daily: Fake Facebook news is a danger to democracy, says Obama Do 'productivity hacks' really help you get stuff done?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 6 October 2016 | MYT 6:30 AM PlayStation VR prepares to disrupt virtual space on Oct 13 Virtual launch: A journalist wearing a PlayStation VR at the 2016 Tokyo Game Show. — AFP Relaxnews As Sony readies a retail launch for the PlayStation 4's virtual reality headset, PSVR, it undercuts the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift by a considerable margin, but could face a strong challenge from Google's Daydream VR project. Sony's involvement in head-mounted displays can be traced back through to the early Glasstron and Visortron models of the mid-to-late 90s, while a more recent line, starting with the 2011's HMZ-T1, offers a more obvious reference point for the PlayStation VR. Like its immediate predecessor, the PSVR comprises a headset and a separate processor box, but the package's standard retail price is around half that of the HMZ kit. It has motion-tracking controllers and a camera that works out where its wearer is. And a competitive price, up to half the price of its immediate competitors, makes it an appealing option – especially for the over 40 million people that already own a PlayStation 4, and those in line for its more powerful relative, November's PlayStation 4 Pro. Come Oct 13, the PlayStation VR will be the third major home VR launch of the year. As an ambitiously executed hobby project and crowdfunding sensation, the Oculus Rift attracted widespread attention across the games and tech industries, and a successful US$2bil (RM8.29bil) approach from Facebook. Following the release of two in-progress Development Kits, a consumer edition arrived March 2016. Priced at US$599 (RM2,482), the Rift is built for use with the sort of powerful PC that costs around US$1,000 (RM4,143) to build from scratch; it also comes with an Xbox One controller, lending weight to speculation that 2017's Xbox Scorpio revision will align with the Rift for marketing and development purposes. As monumental as the Rift's achievement was, HTC and PC gaming giant Valve launched an even more high tech HTC Vive in April. Its US$799 (RM3,311) price tag is a step up at first glance, though a less significant rise when factoring in a US$1,000 PC. Still, both are high-end options, and the PlayStation 4 Pro (US$399/RM1,653) or slimline PS4 (US$299/RM1,239) offer a far less expensive route into VR once the PlayStation VR arrives. Yet Sony may soon face stiff competition from elsewhere. Tech leviathan Google has its own VR system waiting in the wings, and a new line of Android-powered phones will become flagships for its Daydream VR experience. While Daydream-tier phones are not yet on the market, they could become available not long after Google's Oct 4 announcement event, and are likely to pack a significant punch; PlayStation will have a week to respond. — AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Airbnb offers travel services in push to diversify Facebook buys facial recognition tech startup US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Fundraising walk sets new record Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Beware!

Headsets such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift are expensive on their own, and require a hefty investment in computers to run them. There are many “entry-level” VR headsets that run off users’ phones, but many of these are too weak to provide a truly engaging experience. Only the Gear VR has impressed us so far, but its crown may be in peril with Google’s recent announcement of the Daydream View, a headset designed for use with the upcoming Daydream VR software. Just as Google is looking to secure its spot in the smartphone market with the Pixel and Pixel XL phones, the Daydream View is a shot across Samsung’s bow. So how well does the View stack up against the Gear VR? Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — oh my! Everything Google revealed at its October 4 event Daydream View Gear VR Optical Lens TBA 101° field of view Display Depends on device 2560 x 1440 pixel Super AMOLED Refresh Rate Depends on device 60 Hz Required Hardware Google Pixel, Pixel XL, and forthcoming Daydream-compatible phone Galaxy Note 5, Note 7, Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, S7, S7 Edge Sensor Accelerator, gyrometer, proximity Accelerator, gyrometer, proximity Focal Adjustment TBA Focus adjustment wheel Interpupillary Distance Coverage TBA 54~70 mm Physical UI Motion controller (included) Touchpad, back button, volume key Connection Wireless connection USB-Type C and MicroUSB Dimensions TBA 201.9 x 116.4 x 92.6 mm Weight TBA 310 grams Color variants Slate, snow, and crimson Blue black Price $79, plus cost of phone $99, plus cost of phone Availability Pre-orders available October 20 Available Now DT Review Hands-on 4 out of 5 stars Design The first thing Google emphasized about the Daydream View is comfort. Most VR headsets are very obviously gadgets, made of plastic and rubber. People do not typically wear gadgets, Google mused, they wear clothes, so the View was designed with clothing in mind. The headset is made of soft, lightweight fabric, though Google hasn’t specified the materials used in the fabric. For the sake of cleanliness, the face mask can also be removed and washed. The Gear VR, meanwhile, is made of plastic with a matte finish and lined with a rubber face mask. Both headsets have been designed to accommodate users with glasses. Gear-VR_left2More Google’s goal with the View is comfort and ease of use. As such, the View has no wires to fiddle with. Users simply slide their phone into the headset and fasten the clasp, and the phone and headset will connect wirelessly. With the Gear VR, users need to plug their phone in via the micro-USB connection. When it comes to control, the View once again takes a different approach. Google’s headset comes with a simple, two-button controller with motion sensors, so users can manipulate objects and navigate menus in VR with gestures. The Gear merely features a directional pad. It can be paired with third-party controllers, but because they’re not standard, most Gear experiences don’t offer controller support. Performance Google has yet to release specs regarding the View’s display, so we cannot compare its resolution and refresh rate to the Gear’s just yet. Ultimately, the details will depend on the phone. The Google Pixel will have a 1080p display, and the Google Pixel XL will have a 1440p display. Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL are the first Daydream-compatible phones announced thus far, but Google asserts that more such phones will be coming. The Gear, on the other hand, requires a Galaxy phone, such as the S7 or S7 Edge. These have 1440p displays. The specs for the Pixel and Galaxy S7 are similar in terms of processing power and memory, so for now, it does not seem like either headset will provide a remarkably different VR experience. Software In our review of the Gear VR, we noted that the software interface had “a blocky, flat design,” but that navigating it was fairly easy, the only drawback being that users must use the touchpad on the side of the headset. Until we have a chance to test the Daydream headset, it’s difficult to say whether the software is easier to use than the Gear’s. Read More google-daydream-view-01_phoneinheadset-mobileMore Apps and games for the Gear are offered through the Oculus store, and the selection of VR games is nice, but the Gear was lacking in quality apps. Those it did have, such as the Netflix app, also didn’t work as intended. Google is bringing many of its popular apps to Daydream, with virtual-reality twists. Users will be able to watch three-dimensional videos on YouTube, for example, or take VR tours of famous locations in Google Street View. Daydream will have some catching up to do as far as games, but the titles announced so far are interesting, including the sequel to Gunjack. Price Both of these headsets are affordable gateways into VR. The Gear VR retails for $99, and is currently available. The Daydream View will sell for $79 when it hits digital shelves in November, and will be available for pre-order starting October 20. And if you buy a Google Pixel or Pixel XL, you’ll get a Daydream View for free. Samsung offers a similar promotion for the Gear VR. Conclusion Until now, the Gear VR had a virtual monopoly on entry-level VR. Daydream View is its first major competitor, and the rivalry seems close. Although we have not yet had a chance to review the Daydream View — or view the precise hardware specifications — the promise of a softer, more comfortable headset with software designed by Google is alluring. The lower price point also helps, too, but it’s tough to make a final verdict on which is better without seeing how Google’s forthcoming headset performs in real-world situations. Either way, November can’t come soon enough.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Elizabeth Dwoskin October 5 Follow @lizzadwoskin Dag Kittlaus creator Siri for Apple. Now he's joining forces with Samsung. (The Washington Post) SAN FRANCISCO -- Samsung, the largest maker of televisions and smartphones in the world, is buying Viv Labs, a high-profile artificial intelligence startup founded by the inventors of Apple’s Siri voice assistant, the South Korean electronics conglomerate said Wednesday. The move is a major land grab in the battle for cutting-edge artificial intelligence taking place among tech giants. Samsung, which has lagged in such services, is now positioned to add intelligent, Siri-like voice capabilities to its vast collection of home and mobile electronics. “We have a unique opportunity to take advantage of AI, and show the rest of the industry what the smart, connected world can look like,” Jacopo Lenzi, Samsung’s Senior Vice President of Business Development and Strategic Acquisitions, said in an interview. The companies declined to disclose the purchase price of the deal. It is no coincidence that Samsung chose to make its announcement just one day after Google touted its own foray into smartphones and other technologies that can converse back and forth with users, providing them with information and services. Samsung and Google have a longstanding and complex partnership — one that is likely to become further strained now that Google has released a smartphone to compete directly with Samsung’s flagship Galaxy device, said Charles Golvin, research director at Gartner. Google’s Android operating system is used in most Samsung smartphones, as is the Google Play app store and many of Google’s popular apps. Given the frenzy around artificial intelligence, Lenzi said it was not surprising that multiple companies would make similar efforts. He declined to comment further on the Google relationship. Goolge released a high-end smartphone and home device, called Google Home, on Tuesday. Both come equipped with the new so-called Google Assistant, a voice-assistant that can do things like buy movie tickets, play music, or make a hotel reservation when asked. “When I look at where computing is headed, it’s clear to me that we’re evolving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world,” Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai told an audience in San Francisco that had gathered for the launch of the new products. In an interview Tuesday, Google’s Vice President of Product for Android, Brian Rakowski, said the company’s broader goals were to maintain strong partnerships with manufacturers that would elevate the quality of all Android products. He said the Pixel smartphone is in its early days, but that the relationships might be reconsidered down the line. “This is our first rodeo,” Rakowski said. “If we’re successful, maybe we’ll rethink that in a few years.” The Google Assistant sounds remarkably similar to Viv, whose capabilities were outlined in the Washington Post in May. Viv’s founders, Adam Cheyer and Dag Kittlaus, picture a world in which people can interact with technology in one long conversation, liberated from the frustrating experience of toggling between apps on a smartphone. For example, a Viv user could tell the assistant they want a hotel room in San Jose, and the assistant would not only offer options, but ask follow-up questions such as, “Do you prefer a king-size bed or a room with a view?” The assistant would then complete the transaction, all without a person having to go to an app -- or type anything at all. If Viv sounds far-fetched, it’s because nothing like it exists today — and there was always a question of whether the founders could really pull it off. Current virtual assistants, such as Siri, Google Now, or Samsung’s current one called S-Voice, can do a Web search based on a user’s voice command. But those assistants largely produce a list of links and options to click on — users still have to resort to typing to make a purchase. In contrast, Viv Labs has partnered with dozens of vendors behind the scenes, including hotels, florists, movie and concert tickets services, travel companies and even the makers of smart refrigerators and other appliances (In Kittlaus and Cheyer’s world, appliances powered by Viv’s tech will also be able to talk back and forth to consumers). These vendors broke down attributes of their products and shared them with Viv engineers. For example, a flower company has identified its flowers by color, texture, and type so that Viv could be responsive to specific questions. Finding the right buyer was always part of Viv’s strategy. As in the case of Siri, which was a tiny software program when Apple bought it in 2010, Kittlaus knew that getting broad reach would mean partnering with a large player whose products are already used by massive numbers of consumers. Both Google and Facebook made offers earlier this year to buy Viv, and Kittlaus also talked with Comcast, according to people familiar with the matter. Conversations with Samsung began this summer, Lenzi said. Kittlaus said he was impressed by the reach of Samsung — the sheer number of products, from washing machines to smartphones to televisions, that could become animated by conversation. Of course, Viv has not yet been tested on that kind of scale. “I honestly didn’t realize how big it was until we got into these discussions,” Kittlaus said in an interview. “There are are sorts of different touch points that can be brought to life with these conversational interactions.” business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Offers for the microblogging site, which has been dogged by concerns about its growth for years, are due this week, according to The Wall Street Journal. Alphabet’s Google (GOOG) and Walt Disney (DIS) are said to be among the suitors -- and much to the surprise of many pundits, so is the enterprise software giant Salesforce.com (CRM).   Shares of Twitter have gained more than 25 percent over the last month as speculation about a deal for the San Francisco-based company has reached a fever pitch. They surged another 5.7 percent today to close at $24.87 Officials from Google and Disney couldn’t immediately be reached for comment for this story.   Salesforce declined to comment ahead of Chief Executive Marc Benioff’s planned question-and-answer session with Wall Street analysts. When pressed on the issue by CNBC’s Jim Cramer this afternoon, Benioff replied that Salesforce “looks at everything” and passes on most deals. He wasn’t more specific.  Shares of Salesforce pared some of their earlier losses but still closed down 5.8 percent to $68.42. Wall Street analysts have questioned whether the company could afford Twitter, which is seven times as big as Salesforce’s largest acquisition.  Benioff, though, is said to be keen on Twitter because it has a trove of valuable data and a well-known brand, according to The Journal. His interest in the company caught many Wall Street analysts by surprise. However, Fidelity Investments, Salesforce’s largest shareholder, opposes a Twitter acquisition, according to financial news site Benzinga. A Fidelity spokesman declined to comment. “The story hit at the end of Salesforce’s investor day, which was very positively received, immediately turning the mood sour for the cocktail reception afterwards,” wrote Ed Maguire, an analyst with CSLA, in an email. “The CFO and head of Finance were open, available and transparent about the business, and while they could make no comment on the potential for a Twitter deal, it’s our impression that this is being driven by Benioff himself, who reportedly calls Twitter an ‘unpolished jewel’ that could be improved with better management.” Maguire rates the shares as a “buy.”  Twitter has been hurt by turnover in its management ranks. CEO Jack Dorsey helped found the company in 2006 and was ousted two years later after feuding with colleagues. Dorsey returned to run Twitter in 2015, but that raised some eyebrows on Wall Street because Dorsey continued as CEO of payments processor Square (SQ). Whether Twitter would be better off under either Disney’s or Google’s ownership also is a matter of debate. It has 313 million monthly active users, which is dwarfed by Facebook’s (FB) user base of more than 1.7 billion. Twitter is also being eclipsed by newer outfits such as Snapchat, which Bloomberg News noted earlier this year also has more daily users. “I think it’s entirely appropriate for Twitter to remain independent,” wrote Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, in an email. He rates Twitter as “neutral” and doesn’t cover Disney, whose interest he suspects is “pure fabrication.  “[Twitter’s] service isn’t quite like any other, and other than Facebook, I don’t see them as a good fit for anyone,” he added. “I suppose Google could sell more ads, and there may be some synergies with YouTube, Google, etc., but I really don’t see a fit there.” The bottom line for Pachter: “Twitter would only be better if the new owner figures out how to attract new users.  Current management has made slow progress reinvigorating user growth, so a change might be good.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Under the program, riders’ fees will be capped at $2 per trip with the cities picking up the tab for the rest. Foster City has budgeted $60,000 and San Mateo $30,000 for the trial, which starts Monday and continues until the funds are exhausted. The two cities combined have 130,000 residents. “Foster City sits at the entrance to the San Mateo Bridge and is impacted by Bay Area commute-time traffic,” said Foster City Vice Mayor Charlie Bronitsky in a statement. “Our partnership with Scoop not only creates temporary incentives to encourage carpooling, but, we hope, will help change the way people think about commuting.” Waze announced today a new carpool service in San Francisco The new service is by invitation only "to a select group of employers and their employees in the Bay Area," Waze says But if it grows popular, it could put Google in direct competition with ride-hailing giants like Uber and Lyft the Waze Rider app simply matches users with a driver heading their same direction like a virtual version of a casual carpool Media: Wibbitz The move comes as commuter carpools are getting a new impetus from another pilot program. Google’s Waze social-navigation mapping app now is opening up to Bay Area commuters, after a trial with 25,000 workers centered around Google’s Mountain View headquarters. Waze, with 700,000 Bay Area users, will seek to match drivers with riders going the same way with rates of around 54 cents a mile, which is the IRS mileage reimbursement rate. ALSO Driver runs down woman in SF, causing life-threatening injuries Interstate 80 reopened after shooting Car crashes through bank in San Jose, killing one Google and Lyft have also tried carpool commute features, although Lyft pulled the plug on its experiment within five months. Their carpooling features, which are different than the shared-ride options UberPool and LyftLine, allow drivers en route to work to pick up passengers for fees roughly in line with the IRS mileage rate. Carpooling, although universally considered an environmental boon and a cheap solution for congestion, has remained stubbornly stuck in neutral in the Bay Area and the nation for years, with only about 10 percent of commuters opting to share a ride to work. At the same time, the Bay Area has some of the nation’s worst traffic. Scoop and Waze are among several companies seeking to change that by using smartphones, GPS, route-mapping, social media and other technology. Scoop works by teaming up with employers, office parks and local governments. It splits up the morning and afternoon commutes to increase flexibility. Cisco, Stanford Research Park and Moffett Park are among its partners, as well as 10 Bay Area cities, including San Mateo and Foster City. It’s arranged more than 225,000 trips since launching last August. “It’s been really exciting to watch the evolution of public agencies and cities getting more aggressive over time to solve these problems,” Sadow said.

Skip to content Menu Home Google Apps Script Examples TAGS TAGSExplorer TwtrService Twitter Archive Contact Form Search for: MASHe The musing of Martin Hawksey (EdTech Explorer) Home 2016 October Using CiviCRM with Google Script/Google Drive with the new CiviService Google Script Library Using CiviCRM with Google Script/Google Drive with the new CiviService Google Script Library Martin Hawksey October 5, 2016 Share this: | Twitter | Facebook | LinkedIn At the Association for Learning Technology (ALT) we use the open source CiviCRM for membership and events management. I’ve previously described how we are able to do Custom regular reporting from #CiviCRM with Google Sheets and Google Apps Script which is able to trigger reports from Civi which are emailed to a Gmail account before being saved to Google Sheets. I premiered this work at CiviCon London 2015, at the time hinting that there were other ways of integrating Google Drive with CiviCRM. I’m back at CiviCon London again showcasing some of my latest work. This time I’ll be highlighting the CiviService Google Script Library I’ve written. This allows you to easily create custom workflows in Google Drive with your CiviCRM installation via it’s API. To give you an idea how you might use this I’ve created a demonstration project that uses Google Forms for ALT Members to submit events. Responses are validated in a Google Sheet and with a couple of clicks can automatically be used to create a CiviEvent on our site. If you haven’t used Google Script (formerly known as Google Apps Script) before there is a lot to get your head around so in this post I thought I’d go through our event solution as a demonstration. If you are just interested in using the CiviService Google Script Library the id is 1rlzPrAGx2acG1DHAMqZ1egJh6Y9OqUq3cy8e8AwDjLFGfqmr-hQR0YLq and you can jump down to step 5-6 to see how to use it or checkout the README on Github. If you’d just like a version of the final project detailed below here is a copy of the Google Sheet/Form Step 1 – Creating a Google Form I’m not going to go into detail about how to create your Google Form. The main thing is you include fields for event title, start/end dates. Google Forms has some nice build in features for data validation you can use and special input types for dates and times.  The copy of the shared Google Sheet/Form will give you an idea of some of these (if you are creating a From from scratch you can add a Google Sheet by clicking on the Responses tab and click the ‘Create spreasheet’ button). Step 2 – Add some extra columns to your form responses In the Google Sheet collecting the Form responses  you can start building your custom workflow. In this example I’ve added two extra columns called Action and Link. In the Action column I’ve used the build in List of Items Data Validation to create an in-cell dropdown list. There might be other ways you tweak your workflow for approving submitted events. If you want to skip any manual validation you could add some code to automatically add events when they are submitted. You might want to look at free add-ons like Form Notifications to send emails when the form is submitted. Step 3 – Adding some custom interface The idea with this project is that once an event is submitted someone checks it before deciding if it should be added as a CiviEvent. To give the user a menu item to process any decisions we’re going to add a custom menu to our Google Sheet like this one: To do this from your Google Sheet collecting the form responses open Tools > Script editor.. and add the following code: // Adding some basic UI
function onOpen() {
  var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  ui.createMenu('CiviCRM')
      .addItem('Add events', 'processEvents') // menu item name and function
      .addToUi();
}
 If you now Run > onOpen you’ll be prompted for permissions and in your Google Sheet you should see a CiviCRM menu option. The menu doesn’t do anything yet as we haven’t included the porcessEvents function. If you are interested you can find out more about customizing Google Sheets, Docs and Forms interfaces. Step 4 – Processing the Google Sheet data Back in the Script Editor add the following code to your project: // function we call to process the events submitted 
function processEvents(){
  var doc = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var data = doc.getRange(1, 1, doc.getLastRow(), doc.getLastColumn()).getValues();
  var dataObj = rangeToObjects(data);
  for (i in dataObj){
    // if action is 'Add to Civi' and no link then process
    if (dataObj[i].action === "Add to Civi" && dataObj[i].link === ""){
      addEvent(dataObj[i]); // Civi API call to add event
    }
  }
}
 Lines 3-4 of this code load the data from our response collection sheet the .getValues() returning a 2d array of the sheet. On line 3 we call a custom function .rangeToObjects() which turns the 2d array into an object array using the column headings as key values illustrated below:   To use the .rangeToObjects() function we need to add this functionality to our project. The .rangeToObjects() function has been written by a third party developer James Ferreira and there are a couple of ways we can add this to our project. For the purposes of this project we are going to copy/paste the source code but here you can read more about ObjService. To do this we are going to add another script file to our project to make it easier to navigate in our project. This is done in the Script Editor by clicking File > New > Script file. Give your new script file the name ObjApp. When you’ve pasted the code from here in your script editor should look like this: Step 5 – Adding the CiviService Library To add CiviService to your script project in the script editor: Click on the menu item “Resources > Libraries…” In the “Find a Library” text box, enter the script ID 1rlzPrAGx2acG1DHAMqZ1egJh6Y9OqUq3cy8e8AwDjLFGfqmr-hQR0YLq and click the “Select” button. Choose a version in the dropdown box (usually best to pick the latest version). Click the “Save” button. Step 6 – Initializing the CiviService Library To start making API calls you need to setup your CiviCRM installation to use the REST API. The three pieces of information you need are a site key (key), user api key (api_key) and your api base url (api_base = [this_bit]/civicrm/extern/rest.php). There are a couple of ways you can store/use these details. In this example I suggest adding them to the Script Properties dialog. You can do this in the Script Editor > Project properties and then opening the Script tab and store the values  with the property names: api_base, api_key and key To pass these values to the CiviService library you can add the following code to your script project: var config = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperties();
CRM.init(config); Step 7 – Making calls to your CiviCRM API The final piece of code you need is the addEvent() function. The easiest way I’ve found to experiment and build CiviCRM API calls in the API Explorer. Your Civi installation should have this built in at [your_site]/civicrm/api#explorer or you can use the one on the demo installation at http://dmaster.demo.civicrm.org/civicrm/api#explorer (username/password: demo). Using this let you find the entities and parameters you need generating code snippets you can copy and paste. Hopefully the example Event create call looks familiar in the final code snippet we need in our project: // add event to civi with row details
function addEvent(evnt){
  CRM.api3('Event', 'create', {
    "sequential": 1,
    "title": evnt.eventTitle,
    "description": evnt.eventDescription,
    "start_date": combineDateTime(evnt.startDate, evnt.startTime), // As Google Forms have seperate date and time form elements combine these e.g. 201610050930
    "end_date": combineDateTime(evnt.startDate, evnt.endTime),
    // "event_type_id": getEventTypeValue(evnt.eventType), // BONUS if our event labels and values don't match to addition lookup
    "is_active": 1,
    "is_public": 0
  }).done(function(result) {
    if(!result.is_error){
      // if event added put url in the sheet
      var doc = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
      // assuming Link column is 17th along...
      doc.getRange(parseInt(evnt.rowNum)+1, 17).setValue("https://www.alt.ac.uk/" +
                                                         "civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=" 
                                                         + result.values[0].id);
    };
  });
}

/**
* combine a date and time into a string of yyyyMMddhhmmss
*
* @param {Date} date.
* @param {Date} time.
* @return {string} of date+time.
*/
function combineDateTime(date, time){
  return Utilities.formatDate(new Date(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth(), date.getDate(), 
                                       time.getHours(), time.getMinutes(), time.getSeconds()), 
                              Session.getScriptTimeZone(), 
                              "yyyyMMddhhmmss");
} Your script editor should be similar to the code here. Once you have saved your script and added an event via the Google Form, when you add the ‘Add to Civi’ in the action column in the responses sheet and run the CiviCRM > ‘Add events’ menu option if everything goes well you should see the Link column populated with a link to the event created on your Civi site. If it’s not working for you try a copy of the Google Sheet/Form and completing step 6 from above. Easter eggs In the code repository there are a couple of bonus features. In our case we wanted to include an Event Type. As our Event Type labels and values don’t match we make another call to our API to return the option value. Also as are Event Types might change we have another bonus function we can call that can dynamically update the Event Type in the Google Form.

Hey Cortana: It's all about the syllables 5 Oct 2016 at 22:45, Kieren McCarthy Kieren McCarthy Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Security , Iana, Icann, Fcc, Google Recent Articles Intel's new chip targets industrial IoT Samsung ties Thread into two new IoT Artik chips Benioff on being hacked: We're looking into some next-gen fax machines Analysis One of the oddest things about this week's Google hardware launch was to constantly hear the same phrase over and over again from everyone in the same room: "OK Google." Why? Because the ad giant has chosen that phrase to wake up its digital assistant, whether on the new Pixel phone or the new Google Home. OK Google. OK Google. OK Google. OK Google. Even at a Google event, this was too much Googling. The same is true of the other voice-controlled systems out there. Amazon's Echo gives you the option of selecting either the word "Amazon" or the default "Alexa" to turn the assistant on. Then you have "Hey Cortana" from Microsoft and "Xbox on" from Xbox, among others. There is a big problem with this approach, however. First off, you are asking people to recite the name of a company for a product that is supposed to feel personal. Sure, it makes sense for those making it, but not for actual customers. Amazon wisely recognized this when it went for the wake word "Alexa." But does the mass market really want to say "OK Google" every damn time it wants to use a Google product? The answer is no, like every other piece of technology ever invented, maturity lies in allowing people to personalize. We raised this with one man in a position to actually make a change: Rishi Chandra, Google's VP of product management. Chandra gave us the same answer that Amazon gave us when we asked last year if we would be able to change the wake word to our own phrase: no, but maybe in future. I persisted. At our house, we have an Amazon Echo that answers to the word "Alexa." We also have a friend called Alexis. You can imagine what happens whenever she comes round. And when the Echo imagines you are talking to it but can't make out what you're saying – because you are simply in the middle of a conversation – it will often either inform you it doesn't know what you're asking, or attempt to answer a question you never asked. Every time it happens, it is annoying. And there is nothing to stop it. We suggest to Chandra that since the word "Google" is often synonymous with searching online, that the Google Home is likely to be constantly mis-triggering in people's homes. He gets the point but argues the inclusion of "OK" at the beginning makes it far less likely. Choose wisely And here's where you get to the nuts and bolts of it: choosing a wake word is a little bit of an art: it needs to be short, but a minimum of three syllables; it needs to be easy to say; it needs to have a fairly consistent pronunciation across all different types of people; and it needs to be uncommonly used. You need at least three syllables so the software can catch on that you're explicitly speaking to it and that it's not just picking up the start of an unrelated word or random noise. Imagine if you made the wake-up word "Tom" and said "tomato" next to your gadget – you may confuse the heck out of it. Giving consumers the ability to choose their own wake words is a potentially huge headache. Companies would have to effectively guide the choice of a wake word, in a similar way to how we are now constantly told the parameters of the password we must choose: no fewer than six characters; must include a number; can't include the following characters. When it comes to a wake word, it may seem like a great idea to choose a short, easy word like "Dave." Except then Google or Amazon or whoever will then see an enormous increase in the amount of processing their systems will need to carry out – and all because of the millions of people who go by the name Dave. Worse still, the systems can themselves be set off. As we saw when an Xbox ad featuring Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul had the actor saying "Xbox on" to tell his game machine to turn on. The result? People's game consoles all around the country started turning on whenever the ad played on their TV. Just imagine what would happen if the next pop star or reality TV celeb is called Alexa. Amazon's entire product success is dependent on the wider world not using its word. Google is not exactly an uncommon word either. Let's imagine in a few years' time, with millions of Google Homes and Pixel phones around the world, and then during a Presidential Debate, one of the candidates says "OK, Google..." and millions of devices are effectively hijacked. Trouble ahead As more of us move to voice-activated devices, and as we tie in smart phones and digital assistants more to other items in our lives and homes, the opportunity for mischief and crime will also jump. The Echo and Google Home aim to work with smart home devices. It's only a matter of time before someone figures out how to play a recording that unlocks your front door, or reveals personal information. As with default passwords on a router, a default wake word is a security disaster waiting to happen. But is it as easy as the Googles, Microsofts and Amazons simply adding the option for your own wake word? Sadly, no. Google's Chandra implied that the "OK Google" command is much more embedded into its devices and back-end systems than a simple chosen phrase. "We have built so much around this phrase that it simply makes sense to use that," he explained. He seemed very open to the idea of coming up with future variations, but it's clearly not on the priority list. Nor is it with Amazon or Microsoft. And that's because, right now, the market remains small enough that it is currently just an occasional inconvenience. However, the issue is that if these companies don't think about this issue now, they are likely to increasingly hardwire their default wake words into systems, which in turn will make it more and more difficult over time to pull it out when it becomes an issue.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE (L to R) Google Wifi, Google Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Google Pixel XL, Google Pixel and Google Dreamview VR are displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco. The Internet giant ratcheted up its rivalry with Apple and Amazon by unveiling new smartphones, an Internet-connected speaker that channels a digital assistant and other gadgets Google took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware Tuesday, launching premium-priced Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. The unveiling of Google's in-house designed phone came as part of an expanded hardware move by the U.S. company, which also revealed details about its new "home assistant" virtual reality headset and Wi-Fi router system. The San Francisco event marked a shift in strategy for Google, which is undertaking a major drive to make Google Assistant artificial intelligence a futuristic force spanning all kinds of Internet-linked devices. "We are evolving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said. "Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user." Rick Osterloh, head of a new hardware division at the California-based Internet giant, added, "We believe that the next big innovation is going to take place at the intersection of hardware and software, with AI at the center." Pixel will be available with a five- or 5.5-inch display, starting at $649 for U.S. customers, similar to the latest iPhone models. Pre-orders began Tuesday in Australia, Canada, Germany, Britain and the United States. By using its own name on handsets, Google is aiming for a bigger slice of the competitive smartphone market, dominated by Samsung and Apple. Until now, Google's flagship devices had used the Nexus brand with hardware partners that have included China's Huawei and South Korea's LG. The California group also sought to expand in the smartphone market by purchasing Motorola in 2011, but sold the unit less than three years later. Unlike past smartphone alliances, Google stressed that it had complete control of Pixel from start to finish, contracting with Taiwan-based HTC to manufacture handsets. The new Pixel phone is "the first phone made by Google inside and out," said Sabrina Ellis of the Pixel product management team. By producing both the hardware and Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. Besides being the first smartphone to ship with Google Assistant, it will come with unlimited storage for photos and videos and be compatible with the company's new Daydream virtual reality platform. Pixel has a "smart" camera for sublime photos and a program to make it easy for users to switch operating systems, a move aimed at encouraging iPhone users to convert to Android. However, Google may find it challenging to gain market share, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said. "Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone 7th generation phones," he said. "They don't exactly swing anyone around the room." Gartner analyst Brian Blau said "the most exciting part" of Tuesday's announcement was the assistant, which showcases Google's strength in artificial intelligence. "It's a different tactic from Google, taking the stance that they want to have that direct relationship with their customers," he said. "It is clearly a step into Apple's world" of controlling hardware and software and services, he added. Google also showed off a new Daydream View headset into which compatible smartphones can be slipped to serve as screens for virtual reality experiences. Google added to the coming hardware line-up with a modular Wi-Fi system that lets a set of interconnected mini-modems be spread around homes to make signals strong in all spots. The Internet giant also introduced its Google Home virtual assistant, which will be a direct challenge to popular Amazon Echo devices. Google described Home as a voice-activated assistant that enables users to tap into the company's online capabilities to answer questions, manage tasks, control devices in homes, stream videos and more. Google Home was also synced to work with the freshly unveiled Chromecast Ultra device for streaming high-resolution online video to television screens. The $129 Google Home device will be available in retail shops on Nov. 4. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous in Tech Five years after the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the Silicon...

Part of a suite of new products launched on Tuesday, Google Home represents the company's move into smart homes. The device, designed to sit on kitchen countertops or side tables, can act as a central command centre for homes connected to many digital gadgets and systems. Wholly voice-controlled, it is always listening for commands that start with "Ok Google". Using the company's new Google Assistant – a rival to Apple's Siri – Google Home is able to perform functions like answering questions, alerting residents to useful information and controlling other devices in the house. Related story Google shelves modular smartphone Project Ara True to its form, it can also play music from a range of compatible services or streamed directly from a phone. The company promises that Google Assistant will respond to more natural conversation than its predecessor, Google Now. Google Assistant will continue to draw on the company's data as well as information from users' connected accounts to alert them to relevant information like flight information, weather warnings and appointments. Google first unveiled the product at its I/O annual developer conference in May, but went into more detail at yesterday's Made by Google event in San Francisco. It launched a number of new hardware products at the event, including the Pixel phone – the first handset to be designed by Google – and the smartphone-compatible Daydream View VR headset. The major launches suggest Google is trying to turn around its hardware fortunes after the shelving of its vaunted modular smartphone Project Ara and, prior to that, Google Glass. The design of Google Home is white, rounded and minimal, with one concealed button and no switches or screens. It has a capacitive surface that responds to touch. Its bottom half is a speaker component that comes in a range of different colours, as well as metal and fabric finishes. Its appearance is one of the factors distinguishing it from Amazon's similar smart home product, the Echo. Both have the capacity to act as a central control centre for a number of smaller, more niche gadgets. Designers and technology companies have been competing over recent months to provide the first and best smart home products. What unites these various products is that they allow elements of the home that are usually manually controlled – from lighting and heating to doorbells and electronics – to be controlled automatically or remotely. Examples include Philippe Starck's smart radiator valves, which allow homeowners to remotely control the temperature of each room using their voice, and Yves Behar's home security system that allows users to remotely let visitors into their home.

Magazine Jobs Watch Store Hot List Follow: Architecture Design Interiors Movies Comments Opinion News Interviews Highlights About Subscribe Submit a story Advertise Contact Legal Dezeen Magazine Follow: Movies Comments Opinion Architecture Design Interiors Magazine Jobs Watch Store Hot List Google's fabric VR headset is based on the "clothes we love to wear" Share: Alice Morby | 5 October 2016 2 comments Google has upgraded its thrifty cardboard VR headset with a fabric version named Daydream View, which is designed to work with the company's first own-brand smartphone. The Daydream View virtual reality kit consists of a headset and controller. The headset is made with soft, breathable fabric and is designed to fit over eyeglasses. The minimal controller has sensors to mimic the user's movements and gestures. The kit is compatible with any smartphone enabled with the company's Daydream platform, although currently this is only the Google Pixel. Related story VR goggles combined with hand-held controllers offers architects "a whole new way of designing" "Our goal for Daydream is to simplify the complexity behind virtual reality," said Google. "It should be mobile so you can easily carry it with you, and it should be friendly and accessible so everyone can enjoy using it." According to Google, the design of the headset is based on the "clothes we love to wear". It is made with stretch fabric to make it more comfortable. Technology company Mona also used fabric for its set of VR goggles, which similarly incorporate a wearer's smartphone. While it uses fabric, the Daydream goggles function in much the same way as the company's cardboard headset, where the mobile phone is placed behind a latch at the front of the device. However, the new device is able to connect wirelessly to the smartphone, bypassing the need for any cables or connectors. When not in use, it opens up at the front to reveal a pocket designed to store the controller. Daydream was unveiled at an event yesterday, where the company also launched its own-brand smartphone to rival Apple's iPhone and the connected Google Home device. The headset will go on sale in November for £69. It will be available in three different colours – slate, snow and crimson. The Daydream View is the latest in a growing number of virtual-reality headsets created as the technology develops. Designers have envisioned everything from hooded sweatshirts to sculptural helmets as means to immerse the wearer in virtual worlds. The technology's potential role in architecture and design has been much discussed, with visualisation artist Olivier Demangel of IVR Nation saying that VR would become "more powerful than cocaine". These predictions are now becoming more of a reality, with apps such as Google's Tilt Brush allowing designers to walk through their sketches in 3D as they draw them.

HTC has been selected to assemble the device, becoming for Google what Foxconn is to Apple. "Google has done the design work and a lot of the engineering," the Mountain View-based company's hardware chief Rick Osterloh told Bloomberg News. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. After spending years building its design and engineering chops, HTC has been demoted to water boy. Supplying Google with smartphones isn't a victory -- it's an embarrassing end to HTC's decade-long campaign to break out of that contract-manufacturing business and stand on its own two feet. Sure, sure, I see your point - or, and bear with me here, because this might shock you, but maybe, just maybe, being a manufacturer of someone else's phones might actually be a more stable, more profitable, and wiser business decision in the long term.

But they’re not the best thing Google unveiled on stage during Tuesday's media event. The most impressive product the Search giant isn’t something palpable. You won’t be able to buy it in a store by itself. It will come prepackaged in Pixels, Homes and other smart devices Google launches in the future. It’s the Google Assistant, the intelligent, voice-activated AI-powered computer that can respond to intricate queries, and predict what you’re going to need next. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 vs. Google Pixel: 7 ways Google’s new smartphones outshine Apple Google fans who followed live the company’s media event probably noticed how often Google mentioned its Assistant or the advanced artificial intelligence features that are built into a variety of software products, whether it’s Google Allo, Photos or Translate. Google’s big bet for the future is that its AI and machine learning technologies will create an Assistant so useful that you’ll want to buy any product that has it preloaded. google-assistant1More But there’s one huge drawback to having a computer try to guess your next actions and predict what you’re going to look for: It has to know everything about you. You can’t have the Assistant suggest places and things you might like if it can’t map your habits. The Assistant will become more powerful and faster the more data it grabs from your day-to-day activities, with the help of the Android devices you use. The same data, however, will also help Google understand who you are and what you may buy next. That information is then used to advertise products that are most likely to appeal to you. At the end of the day, Google has to make money. And advertising remains its primary moneymaker. Yes, it’s great that the Assistant can do all the things Google demoed on stage. And Google isn’t alone at developing such products. But you can’t have both privacy or encrypted Allo chats and a fully functional Assistant. At least not now, and not from Google. As Gizmodo points out, Google is pretty vague about what data the Assistant can extract from your device. It can read “storage,” or practically anything that you have on your phone, and it can see the “content on your screen.” In Allo, the Assistant can see everything you type, and that information is kept on Google’s server for quite a while, much longer than we thought. If you care about privacy and encryption, these unwanted but necessary Assistant side effects can be worrisome. That’s especially true considering that tech companies get hacked and spied upon on a regular basis.

Considering you sync files to your Dropbox account and share links with other users, two-step authentication is an absolute must. I'll walk you through the simple process of enabling this extra security layer on your Dropbox account, so that you can rest assured no one is logging into your account without access to your mobile device. SEE: 2012 Dropbox hack worse than realized, 68M passwords leaked Downloading an app that generates sign-in codes More about IT Security The 20 biggest tech disasters of all time Interview with a hacker: S1ege from Ghost Squad Hackers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter As when using two-factor authentication with any service, you'll need an app that will generate your sign-in codes. Two such apps that I prefer are Google Authenticator and Authy. I prefer Authy, as it allows you to sync multiple devices with your Authy account. To install Authy, follow these steps. 1. Open the Google Play Store on your Android device (this can also be installed on iOS devices through the App Store). 2. Search for Authy. 3. Locate and tap the entry by Authy. 4. Tap Install. 5. Tap Accept. 6. Allow the installation to complete. SEE: How to set up Authy on multiple devices for more convenient two-factor authentication Enabling two-step authentication 1. Log into your Dropbox account via a web browser and then click the username drop-down in the upper right corner of the window. 2. Select Settings and then click the Security tab. 3. Under Two-Step Verification, click the link marked Click To Enable. 4. When prompted, click Get Started and enter your Dropbox account password. 5. In the popup window (Figure A), select Use A Mobile App. 6. Click Next, and you will be presented with a QR code. 7. On your mobile device, open Authy, tap the Menu button (three dots in the upper-right corner), and tap Add Account. Figure A Image: Jack Wallen You can get your codes either via texts or mobile app. 8. Tap the SCAN QR CODE button (Figure B) and then use the scanner to scan the code presented to you by your Dropbox account. Figure B Image: Jack Wallen Adding Drobox to Authy on a OnePlus 3. 9. Give the account a name, tap Done, return to the browser window (where the QR code was presented), and tap Next. 10. Enter the six-digit code presented by Authy into the Dropbox window and click Next. 11. Enter your phone number (to be used for backup codes) and click Next. 12. You'll be presented with a list of one-time use only backup codes. Copy those codes, click Enable Two-Step Verification, and click Done. You're all set—Dropbox is now secured behind two-step authentication. The only way to get into your Dropbox account is knowing the username/password and having the six-digit login code generated by Authy. Two-step authentication is a necessity Two-step authentication might seem like a hassle to some, but considering the protection it gives your data, this should be considered a must-do for everyone. Enable two-step authentication with every service that offers the feature—you won't regret taking the extra time to secure your information.

Art In America News & Features Exhibitions Magazine Newsletter Subscribe Search Magazine Oct. 01, 2016 The Digitized Museum by Brian Droitcour, William S. Smith Aram Bartholl’s sculpture Map, 2013, 23 feet tall; in “Hello World!,” 2013, at Kasseler Kunstverein. Photo Nils Klinger. Advertisement Most changes to the attitudes and actions that define the museum experience have been catalyzed by visitors’ personal mobile devices, rather than by high-tech gallery infrastructure. 1. To obtain this figure, we selected sixty-one US art museums and read their online staff directories and press releases to find hires and appointments in these newly created positions. Novel technologies can attract new audiences and excite potential donors, creating a feedback loop of engagement and financial support. Or at least that’s the hope. 2. Bruegel’s work also appears in the 1972 Soviet science-fiction thriller Solaris, where director Andrei Tarkovsky does a lingering close-up pan of The Hunters in the Snow (1565), kept in facsimile on a spaceship, which he offers, perhaps, as a symbol of the mystery of the human spirit as it confronts a strange alien intelligence. 3. Karsten Schubert, The Curator’s Egg: The Evolution of the Museum Concept from the French Revolution to the Present Day, third edition, London, Ridinghouse, 2009, p. 152. 4. Ben Davis, “How the Rich Are Hurting the Museums They Fund,” New York Times, July 22, 2016, nytimes.com. The digitization of the museum prompts a renewed examination of whom the institution serves, and to what ends. AMONG THE SUBTLER indications that technology is driving profound changes in cultural institutions are the new words and symbols that have cropped up in museums’ communications to their visitors. A curator’s introduction, printed in vinyl on the wall, might have appended to it an official hashtag to be used in posts about the show to Twitter or Instagram. A label might have the lopsided grid of a QR code, to be scanned for further information about the work nearby. When the Whitney Museum of American Art staged a Jeff Koons retrospective as the final show at its Madison Avenue location in 2014, slips of paper inserted in pamphlets for teens advised: KOONS IS GREAT FOR SELFIES! These forms of address normalize and affirm behavior that has become habitual as more and more people carry networked computers in their pockets. Museumgoers text their friends or compose work emails. They consult Google for more information about an artist. They pose for photos to commemorate the visit on Facebook. So it should come as no surprise that museums have met them halfway, attempting to claim institutional authority in the field—and feeds—of online communication. One example is #museumselfie day, an annual, internet event launched in 2014, shortly after the Whitney hosted a symposium on museums and social media where discussion focused largely on photography policies. Accepting the inevitability of smartphone use in and around their galleries, museums try to harness it to heighten their own appeal. But the internet, unlike the white cube, is messy. Serious debates about access and pedagogy on #artsed compete with more frivolous ones on #emojiarthistory. The question isn’t if museums will participate in these exchanges, but how they will. Are curators allowed to send glib tweets on #askacurator day? Will a museum invite the public to catch Pokémon in front of a Parmigianino? Most changes to the attitudes and actions that define the museum experience have been catalyzed by visitors’ personal mobile devices, rather than by high-tech gallery infrastructure. While some art institutions have introduced digital information kiosks and touchscreen displays, most have avoided installing costly hardware that has to be upgraded or replaced every few years. The most ambitious digital interventions in galleries have been temporary. In summer 2015, New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art launched The Return, an interactive installation by Reid Farrington commissioned to celebrate the successful twelve-year restoration of  Tullio Lombardo’s Adam (ca. 1490–95), a marble sculpture that had been shattered in a 2002 accident. The Return featured a life-size digital rendering of Adam displayed on a screen adjacent to the restored sculpture. The 3D avatar was synced to the movements of a live performer out of view, and seemed to interact with docents and visitors. The digital Adam was a fleeting spectacle designed to generate attention for the virtuoso, but often unsung, work of conservators and to attract visitors to a key portion of the Met’s historically diverse collection, much like the earlier illumination of the Temple of Dendur with colored laser light.   DIGITAL MEDIA have also brought more durable changes that can’t be seen by the average museum visitor. Some of the biggest structural shifts are happening in the staff offices. New positions have been created to steward the integration of strategies and methods for using digital media across long-standing disciplinary divisions. In the last four years, nearly a third of major US art museums have appointed “digital directors.”1 People employed in these positions come from a variety of backgrounds—from scholarship to communications to IT— and the exact titles vary (“manager of museum digital strategy,” “deputy director for digital experience,” “director of digital adaptation”). What matters is that these new officials don’t report to directors of communications and marketing, as digital managers do at the many institutions that haven’t established high-level positions. Rather, they report directly to senior museum leadership.  While not a digital director, Paola Antonelli, curator of design at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, has been at the forefront of  efforts to integrate digital technologies into curatorial departments. She coded websites for her exhibitions in the 1990s. Some of the most innovative digital projects today attempt to transform the museum’s homepage into something more than an ad or a directory. The website for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis features artists’ op-eds, art historical research, and a selection of cultural news from other resources. Likewise, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s Open Space blog goes beyond highlighting what’s happening at the museum, hosting critical discussion for local and national arts scenes. It also serves as a platform for multimedia artwork. Many institutions have undertaken major initiatives to publish collection data and reproductions of artworks online, along with museum archives. Extending the purview of digital innovation beyond marketing can provide new avenues for creative work, scholarship, and institutional openness. But more often than not it tends to infect those fields with practices from the business side, exacerbating the increasing influence of marketing and fund-raising departments in museums over the last several decades. Curators are now confronted with analytics about who is visiting their shows and how those visitors are interacting with the displays—analytics that prompt everything from implicit managerial pressure to direct recommendations for increasing attendance. In order to get the money they need to launch ambitious projects, museums often have to define their mission in terms that make sense to nonprofit foundations funded solely by number-crunching technology companies.  One organization at the forefront of efforts to digitize museums is the Google Cultural Institute, a nonprofit offshoot of the Silicon Valley behemoth Alphabet. The GCI uses Google Street View technology to create 360-degree representations of museum galleries. Anyone with internet access can simulate the experience of wandering through the Hermitage’s grand halls, the Met’s Northern Renaissance collection, or the galleries of the Archaelogical Museum in Harappa, Pakistan. In some of the bigger institutions that participate in the Google Art Project—the branch of GCI that works with museums—paintings and sculptures under copyright protection are blurred, like the faces of people captured by the cameras on the Google vans that photograph streets, underscoring the limits of the access Google provides.  And yet the GCI offers a viewing experience that, in other ways, far surpasses that of a real gallery. So-called gigapixel captures—ultra high-resolution images of paintings—enable viewers to “go deep,” as lead Google engineer Amit Sood explained in a 2011 TED Talk. Visitors can zoom into the backgrounds of old master landscapes, presented at some ten billion pixels, and study details that are difficult to discern with the naked eye. Given its depth and complexity, Pieter Bruegel’s work has often been used by Google to demonstrate the amazing possibilities of this and other imaging technologies.2 Working with the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, GCI recently produced animated virtual reality representations of some of the Flemish artist’s masterpieces. A smartphone video player combined with Cardboard, Google’s VR viewer, transformed The Fall of the Rebel Angels (1562) into a dynamic, immersive environment in which a cast of demonic antagonists appears to wrestle and fight.  Where is the line between enriching the experience of viewing a work and fundamentally transforming it? It’s exciting to see a 450-year-old painting or a 500-year-old statue (like the Met’s Adam) set in motion. But when the museum and its corporate partners bring these works “to life” with cutting-edge tech, are they also implicitly declaring the death of the static art objects that fill physical galleries? In 1999, museum historian Karsten Schubert predicted: “As more and more aspects of our lives become virtual, our fetishist fixation on the museal object may grow in accordance.”3 But the increasing prevalence of spectacular animations of “dead” works makes Schubert’s assertion ever harder to accept. The value of the static object seems to decrease as museums satisfy cravings for mobile, flexible media.   MUSEUMS AIMING to enrich and enliven encounters with their collections through digital means face significant challenges. Chief among them is the expense of building and maintaining the necessary infrastructure. Though a robust social media presence can be a comparative bargain, gigapixels don’t come cheap. At a time when most museums are slashing staff and struggling to raise funds, it may seem irrational to pursue digital spectacles that could be dismissed as luxuries, or broaden virtual access when brick-and-mortar institutions require upkeep. Yet novel technologies can attract new audiences and excite potential donors, creating a feedback loop of engagement and financial support. Or at least that’s the hope.  The tech buildup parallels the contemporary boom in museum construction in this sense. “Institutions that already had to beg for funding were drawn into building more expensive facilities,” critic Ben Davis argued in a recent New York Times Op-Ed. “It is evidently still easier to raise money for fancy new things than to maintain what is already here. . . . So, have museums been growing? Yes. But on a sustainable basis? No.”4 Apps, VR displays, and touch-screen kiosks might be considered examples of “fancy new things,” along with shiny new wings by famous architects. Well-funded organizations like Bloomberg Philanthropies have enthusiastically supported such digital initiatives, partnering with cultural institutions of various sizes around the world in the name of easier access to art through technology.   But there are reasons to be wary when private-sector entities rush to bridge the gap between public museums’ digital aspirations and their brick-and-mortar realities. Google may currently share its high-res images with the world, but the valuable data ultimately lives on its servers. The British Museum had been working on independent technology to represent its galleries online, but then in 2015 it abandoned the project, citing expense, and handed over the data to Google. What does it mean for paintings held in the public trust by institutions that receive taxpayer subsidies to be converted into partly privatized pixels? Copyright laws in this area are murky, and there’s no way to know what return on investment the private tech companies partnering with museums will expect in the future.  While the effects brought about by digital media aren’t as readily visible as construction, they are arguably even more important. Museums aren’t just sharing data they already have. They are producing new kinds of data. Mobile apps, such as the one launched by the Dallas Museum of Art, offer access to virtual representations of the museum’s collection and extended texts about exhibitions, but they also track users’ movements in the galleries and log information about their preferences. The museum’s role as custodian of objects is doubled by a new role as custodian of data. And if the purpose of preserving art objects is to serve the public—those future artists, students, and seekers who might find inspiration or solace in them—the purpose of maintaining a data stockpile is less romantic. The digitization of the museum prompts a renewed examination of whom the institution serves, and to what ends.

Now it's here. But it's got an unfamiliar moniker. James Martin/CNET Why the Pixel phone isn't called the Google Phone 0 Share: Mobile by Richard Nieva October 5, 2016 2:17 PM PDT @richardjnieva Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy It's finally here: the Google Phone. Well, not quite. It's officially called "Pixel, Phone by Google," and the search giant unveiled it Tuesday during a much-hyped event in San Francisco. The Pixel, available with either a 5-inch or 5.5-inch display, is a grown up Google phone, meant to compete with the top brass of the smartphone world, including Samsung and Apple. It's a sharp strategic shift for Google, which has until now been content with selling phones through its Nexus program. For that, Google farmed out some of the hardware design to other manufacturers -- like LG, Asus and Huawei -- who put their brands on the phone alongside Nexus. For tech watchers, the Pixel ends years of speculation about when Google would actually build a premium phone. The rumors started the moment Google bought a tiny mobile software startup called Android in 2005, a move that eventually pit it against Apple's iOS software for the iPhone. It prompted Apple's Steve Jobs to declare he was willing to spend every bit of his company's cash on fighting a "thermonuclear" war to destroy Android. The phone has Google's signature G on the back.Photo by James Martin/CNET So when Apple announced its own foray into the smartphone market in 2007 with the iPhone, we knew something was missing, an archrival. Coke has Pepsi, the Lakers have the Celtics, Tupac had Biggie. The iPhone needed a worthy competitor, someone even more formidable than Samsung, the world's biggest maker of phones. That's why a Google phone has been a long time coming. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, a Google vice president of product management, said in an interview Tuesday. More on Pixel Google Pixel offers cold comfort to silent partner Google Pixel cautiously rolls dice with Verizon exclusivity Google Pixel makes a bid for Android history But dreams of this hypothetical clash of the tech titans typically envisioned the iPhone (a name that Apple bought from Cisco, by the way) fighting against the Google Phone. Or maybe the Gphone, as Android co-founder Andy Rubin called it in 2007. Something you could picture in lights on a marquee or in headlines on review face-offs. Instead, we got iPhone versus...Pixel. It's not exactly epic, like Superman versus Batman (the superheros, not the movie). Google insists Pixel is the right name for its new phone. "For us, it's always represented the best of hardware and software designed and built by Google," Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, said on stage Tuesday. That's because Pixel isn't a new name. There are already Pixel Chromebook laptops and tablets that Google designed in-house. Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, introduced the new phone.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, it's pretty much an unknown brand. And that may be the point, said Dean Crutchfield, a New York-based brand consultant. For most people, Google means search. The Google name doesn't have the "panache" to carry a high-end phone. "The reason the phone isn't called Google is the brand doesn't stretch that far," he said. "If you stretch a brand too far, it snaps." Plus, Google thinks people will come to know it as "the Google phone" anyway, despite its proper name, a company spokeswoman said. She points out that it says "Phone by Google" on the box and the phone itself has a big G on the back. "Phone by Google" is also printed in teeny tiny, nearly illegible letters on the bottom of the back of the phone. "People know who built this phone," Rakowski continued. "It's quite clear. We're not being shy about it." A 'most-loved' brand Maybe you're thinking it's unimportant to dissect a name, that it's just semantics. Shakespeare wrote, "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." But remember, Romeo and Juliet died because of their names. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management Google knows better than anyone that branding and marketing matter. Just look at the ill-fated Google Glass, which failed because, among other things, the company couldn't get the story right as to why you'd spend $1,500 on awkward eyewear. If Google wants to go up against a heavyweight like the iPhone with this new phone -- and by all accounts, it does, given the Pixel's starting price of $650 and Google's exclusive deal with Verizon as the wireless provider -- then the company needs to nail everything, including the marketing. And the name. There are probably several reasons why the company wanted to call it something besides the Google Phone. Maybe Google didn't want to scare its hardware partners, which are still deeply important when it comes to Android, by jumping into the deep end with a full-on, branded phone. Or, if the phone is a flop, it would be tough to give it a second try with another Google phone if the company has already played that name card. Google made its own premium phone to showcase its software and services.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, the Google name is a world-class asset. It's the most valuable brand in the world, according to the BrandZ Top 100 list, a study by the branding and advertising agency Kantar Millward Brown. Who's No. 2? Apple. And when it comes to the world's most-loved brands, Google is No. 4, according to the YouGov BrandIndex. Apple is close behind at No. 6. Interestingly enough, the study also lists the iPhone as its own brand. It's No. 8. Maybe Google hopes Pixel will join the list. The ranking suggests people tend to think good things when they hear Google. What do people think when they hear Pixel? Maybe that Adam Sandler movie that got a 16 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and 27 on Metacritic. But if Google didn't choose Pixel because Pixel could help its brand power, it could be the other way around, said Jan Dawson, CEO of Jackdaw Research. "If Google does a phone named Pixel, and it's successful, then it makes Pixel successful," he said. Or maybe there's something more subliminal at work here. A pixel, literally, is a kind of unit of measurement for images on a screen. On phones, pixels are the building blocks of software as manifested on a display. And software has always been at the heart of Google. So even though you're holding a shiny rectangle in your hand with Google's signature G on the back, Google wants to remind you that it's in the business of software. Pixels, not atoms. And in fact, that's how Google executives, standing under a digital banner that declared "Made by Google," explained it on Tuesday when they discussed why it's time for Google to make its own hardware: Software and data are bigger parts of people's lives than ever. Said Osterloh: "The rise of volume and complexity of all the information makes it so that this is the right time to be focused on hardware and software."

Brandon Doyle believes the light will make Spectacles “less creepy” than Google Glass, which didn’t have one. (Instagram/@dankaufmannyc) Snapchat announced Sept. 23 the release of Spectacles and the renaming to Snap Inc. This has established the company as a company that sells cameras, according to snap.com. Spectacles are similar in appearance to Google Glass. Brandon Doyle, founder of Wallaroo Media and professor in the adjunct department at BYU, believes Spectacles will be better than Google Glass because they promise less. “(Google Glass’s) focus was they wanted to be everything … Snap is … positioning themselves more as a toy,” Doyle said. They will be one-size-fits-all glasses in teal, black or coral, according to techcrunch.com. The glasses will shoot 150-degree wide video for 10-30 seconds and have a light to warn people they’re on camera. It will also store video that can be offloaded onto a mobile device via WiFi or Bluetooth and have a battery-life of about one day. It can get up to four recharges with a portable charging case, according to techcrunch.com. Daniella Abbott, a public relations BYU graduate and team lead of social media and public relations at Wallaroo Media, said the $130 cost of Spectacles will appeal to buyers more than the cost of Google Glass, initially about $1500. Abbott said she might wear Spectacles, but not very often. “If I was traveling I’d wear them … but I wouldn’t wear them to do anything remotely useful,” Abbott said. Adam Durfee is Wallaroo’s director of social media strategy and digital public relations and an adjunct BYU professor. Durfee believes Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap Inc., wants to reinvent the camera. “He wants people to take video, that looks just the way they saw it, so they can relive a memory,” Durfee said. Durfee believes Spiegel is just testing the water with Spectacles to see if Snap Inc. can sell hardware and if people will be interested in Snap Inc.’s cameras. “They only have a limited release at a fairly low price, so I’m not convinced they’re even trying to make much money on the product,” Durfee said. Doyle believes Spectacles will become more than just a camera. “It’s going to be, probably, what Google Glass always wanted to be. (Snap Inc.) is just taking a different approach,” Doyle said. Doyle also anticipates Snap Inc. will try and market Spectacles to a couple of celebrities in order to get it to take off. He believes Google can’t sell Google Glass to celebrities because they look nerdy. “(Spectacles) are going to look cool,” Doyle said. “They’re going to maybe look a little weird at first, but they’re still going to look cool.” Snap Inc. officially announced 41 percent of the 18 to 34 age group in the U.S. use Snapchat 25 to 30 minutes a day, according to Doyle. Doyle believes Snap Inc. will try and strengthen the hold it has now with Millennials, as opposed to trying to make a profit initially on Spectacles. “I think the whole approach is make something cool, make it perfect, worry about (making money) later,” Doyle said.

Google Needs To Step Up Support To Sell Its Own Smartphones Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Needs To Step Up Support To Sell Its Own Smartphones October 5, 2016 5:35 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup inevitable comparisons to apple customer service google pixel phones smartphones Google’s customer support has come a long way since it first began selling Nexus mobile phones and Google Voice number ports to customers. However, the success of its new suite of devices depends on how well it’s able to provide customer and technical support for those devices. Google’s history with customer support is not great, which is why it’s an encouraging sign that the Pixel includes the ability to message customer support from inside the actual phone, which is definitely better than its Nexus-era method of offering user forums and maybe some e-mail support. Those weren’t even good enough for paid customers of Google Voice, let alone a device that costs hundreds of dollars, and eventually Google relented and opened up a phone support line. The Pixel is available most commonly in Verizon stores and at Best Buy, which makes them easy to buy, but means that Google doesn’t have much control over how they’re displayed and demonstrated to customers. Since Google made plenty of not-so-subtle comparisons of the iPhone to the Pixel where the iPhone came up short, critics like Bloomberg Technology draw inevitable comparisons to Apple and its retail network. Microsoft is building a similar network of stores, but is that something that Google needs to do? Google Has Its Own Phones.

The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month.  It is the clearest sign yet that Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company's future as quickly as possible. Twitter has yet to post a profit even after ramping up advertising efforts WHO WILL BUY TWITTER?  With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence.  Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter.

Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people said this week. Salesforce.com Inc is in the running, while Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Walt Disney Co have also been contemplating bids, the people added. It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the people cautioned.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.

Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. The company missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook Inc's Instagram and Snapchat.  FindTheCompany | Graphiq Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as chief executive more than a year ago, has been part of Disney's board since 2013. Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share.  The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO, but have been on steady downward trajectory since.

The gadget, which listens to you, answers questions and carries out tasks like calling an Uber or turning on your lights, is finding a place in millions of living rooms. However, it will soon face competition from Google and Apple. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) New York • Does your home really need a "smart speaker" that can answer questions, call you an Uber, turn off the lights or play music when you ask? You may be about to find out. Two years ago, Amazon introduced the Amazon Echo, an unassuming, $180 cylinder that sits atop a kitchen counter or bookshelf, acting as a personal assistant that listens to you and does your bidding. Initially, the gadget's main purpose was a little difficult to discern. But Echo and its Alexa voice recognition software have since become a sleeper hit, with an estimated 3 million gadgets sold as of April, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. VIDEOS TOP JOBS MAKING THE HOME "SMART" Now the Echo is getting some company. On Tuesday, Google announced a similar smart speaker called Google Home, which will be available in November for $129. It will perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions plus controlling compatible lights and appliances. The Google Assistant that works with Home will also be able to access your calendar, Google Maps and other services if you allow. Apple has opened up its Siri personal assistant so that third-party developers can create new features for it, much the way Amazon has done with its Alexa software. Google Assistant is also opening up to outside apps in December. Sony is working on Xperia Agent , a digital assistant that connects to devices in the home. All these companies are chasing the smart-home market, which could grow to be a $71 billion global industry by 2018, up from $33 billion in 2013 and $25 billion in 2012, according to Juniper Research. That's growing fast, although it's still much smaller than the smartphone market, which the research firm IDC valued at about $412 billion in 2015. But while the Echo carved out an early success, it remains to be seen whether voice-recognition smart speakers will truly break into the mainstream. "They're early, (but) the market is early, and we have a long way to go," said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner. LEARNING NEW SKILLS One key to the Echo's success was Amazon's willingness to work with third-party developers, allowing it to add new functions each week, making it easy for owners of the speaker to discover new ways to use it. (It launched with a few dozen so-called 'skills' and now has thousands). "Initially we got it for music," said Brian Bishop, a business analyst in Tomball, Texas, whose family uses two Echos. "Later, when it controlled the lights and fans and outlets, that just made it even better." Interest in smart homes appears to be rising as more people become enamored with their smartphones. A recent online survey of more than 4,600 adults in the U.S. by Forrester Research's Technographics found 57 percent of them either had used or were interested in using a smart home device such as lights or thermostats designed for remote control. The Echo's hands-free operation filled an undiscovered niche in the smart-home universe. Users can just say the wake word "Alexa" and direct it to do a task like turn on lights or set a timer. Since you don't need to use a smartphone or tablet, that sets it apart from other smart home systems like those offered by Samsung or Apple. SPEAK TO ME People seem to have an easier time talking to a speaker that has no other interface than they do talking to a smartphone. "I've never used Cortana. I don't use Google and my wife doesn't use Siri, but everybody talks to Alexa," Bishop from Texas said. "I couldn't really tell you why. That was the only way to communicate, so we all got in the habit." Buck Wise, an advertising executive in Portland, Oregon, tried several variants of smart home systems, but said the Echo worked best for him because of the hands-free speaker. He has lights, blinds, and his garage door synced with the Echo. "Alexa truly is the brain of our home and it would feel like 100 steps backwards to get through a day without her," Wise said. » Next page...

Offers for the microblogging site, which has been dogged by concerns about its growth for years, are due this week, according to The Wall Street Journal. Alphabet’s Google (GOOG) and Walt Disney (DIS) are said to be among the suitors -- and much to the surprise of many pundits, so is the enterprise software giant Salesforce.com (CRM).   Shares of Twitter have gained more than 25 percent over the last month as speculation about a deal for the San Francisco-based company has reached a fever pitch. They surged another 5.7 percent today to close at $24.87 Officials from Google and Disney couldn’t immediately be reached for comment for this story.   Salesforce declined to comment ahead of Chief Executive Marc Benioff’s planned question-and-answer session with Wall Street analysts. When pressed on the issue by CNBC’s Jim Cramer this afternoon, Benioff replied that Salesforce “looks at everything” and passes on most deals. He wasn’t more specific.  Shares of Salesforce pared some of their earlier losses but still closed down 5.8 percent to $68.42. Wall Street analysts have questioned whether the company could afford Twitter, which is seven times as big as Salesforce’s largest acquisition.  Benioff, though, is said to be keen on Twitter because it has a trove of valuable data and a well-known brand, according to The Journal. His interest in the company caught many Wall Street analysts by surprise. However, Fidelity Investments, Salesforce’s largest shareholder, opposes a Twitter acquisition, according to financial news site Benzinga. A Fidelity spokesman declined to comment. “The story hit at the end of Salesforce’s investor day, which was very positively received, immediately turning the mood sour for the cocktail reception afterwards,” wrote Ed Maguire, an analyst with CSLA, in an email. “The CFO and head of Finance were open, available and transparent about the business, and while they could make no comment on the potential for a Twitter deal, it’s our impression that this is being driven by Benioff himself, who reportedly calls Twitter an ‘unpolished jewel’ that could be improved with better management.” Maguire rates the shares as a “buy.”  Twitter has been hurt by turnover in its management ranks. CEO Jack Dorsey helped found the company in 2006 and was ousted two years later after feuding with colleagues. Dorsey returned to run Twitter in 2015, but that raised some eyebrows on Wall Street because Dorsey continued as CEO of payments processor Square (SQ). Whether Twitter would be better off under either Disney’s or Google’s ownership also is a matter of debate. It has 313 million monthly active users, which is dwarfed by Facebook’s (FB) user base of more than 1.7 billion. Twitter is also being eclipsed by newer outfits such as Snapchat, which Bloomberg News noted earlier this year also has more daily users. “I think it’s entirely appropriate for Twitter to remain independent,” wrote Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, in an email. He rates Twitter as “neutral” and doesn’t cover Disney, whose interest he suspects is “pure fabrication.  “[Twitter’s] service isn’t quite like any other, and other than Facebook, I don’t see them as a good fit for anyone,” he added. “I suppose Google could sell more ads, and there may be some synergies with YouTube, Google, etc., but I really don’t see a fit there.” The bottom line for Pachter: “Twitter would only be better if the new owner figures out how to attract new users.  Current management has made slow progress reinvigorating user growth, so a change might be good.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez/Eric Risberg) (PCMag.com) - For the first time, Android has its very own flagship in the form of the 5-inch Google Pixel and 5.5-inch Google Pixel XL. Technically, both phones are made by HTC, but Google has involved itself more in these two devices than any previous Nexus, including the 6P and 5X. You won’t even find any HTC branding on either Pixel; they’re Google through and through. Naturally, we have to see how the Pixel measures up with the Samsung Galaxy S7 —widely considered to be the best Android phone available, especially since its Edge variant is our Editors’ Choice winner for best Android phone. Design, Display, and Features There’s no denying it, the Pixel looks more like an Apple iPhone 7 than any other Android phone, from the metal unibody and layout of its camera (absent the hump) to the antenna lines, bottom speakers, and the notably large top and bottom bezel on the front. But unlike the iPhone, the Pixel sports a fingerprint scanner on the back, set in the middle of a half pane of glass. You’ll also find a USB-C charging port on the bottom and a 3.5mm audio jack up top. The power button and volume rocker are on the right. The Galaxy S7 is also a glass-and-metal phone, following Samsung’s premium design language. You have metal sides, a glass back, and a combined fingerprint scanner/home button on the front with a set of capacitive buttons on either side. Unlike the Pixel, the S7 also uses microUSB rather than USB-C. Ultimately, aesthetics are always going to be a matter of opinion, but it’s hard to argue that the S7 isn’t more symmetrical and put together in terms of its overall look. The Really Blue Pixel does look nice, though. Despite the distinct design differences, both phones are roughly the same size. The Google Pixel measures 5.7 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5 ounces; the S7 (5.6 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches) is a tiny bit heavier at 5.4 ounces. Both phones should be fairly easy to use one-handed, but you’re likely to notice one big difference when looking at them. The 5-inch Pixel only has a 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED display, which won’t be as sharp or rich as the S7’s 5.1-inch, 2,560-by-1,440 Super AMOLED panel. Their respective resolutions work out to 441 pixels per inch for the Pixel and a much denser 577ppi for the S7. Samsung is widely considered to have some of the best displays in the market, and it seems in this category the Pixel can’t compete. That said, 1080p should still be more than enough on a 5-inch phone. Between the two phones, the major things the Pixel lacks are waterproofing, wireless charging, and a microSD card slot. By contrast, the S7 is IP68 waterproof, letting it survive for 30 minutes under six feet of water. It also supports wireless charging and can take a microSD card up to 256GB, albeit with Marshmallow’s adoptable storage feature disabled. Processor and Battery The Pixel is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor with 4GB of RAM, and comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. The S7 is powered by the Snapdragon 820 and has 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. When it comes to performance, the S7 was blazing fast in our tests, scoring an impressive 123.993 on AnTuTu, which measures overall system performance. We’ll need to put the Pixel through its paces here at PC Labs, but due to its improved processor, less demanding display, and lightweight UI, we can reasonably expect the Pixel to perform better in benchmarks. In terms of real-world usage, though, both phones are fast and powerful. Battery life is another factor that’s hard to determine without testing. The S7 has a 3000mAh cell under the hood, which lasted nine hours during our rundown test, where we set screen brightness to maximum and stream full-screen video over LTE. The Pixel has a somewhat smaller 2,770mAh battery, but compensates with a lower-resolution display, so we’re expecting a fairly good runtime. Both phones support fast charging. Camera The Samsung Galaxy S7 has the best camera of any smartphone on the market, including the iPhone 7. With a 12-megapixel rear-facing sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS), a fast-launching camera app, 4K video recording, and 5-megapixel front-facing camera, the S7 is known for taking crisp shots in most lighting conditions. The Pixel has the potential to give it a run for its money, though. It comes with a fully redesigned camera, boasting a 12.3-megapixel rear sensor with laser autofocus and dual-LED flash, an 8-megapixel front sensor, and support for 4K video recording. Notably, it topped DxOmark’s ranking, scoring 89, which is a tad higher than the S7 Edge’s 88 (the S7 and S7 Edge share the same camera hardware). During its launch event, Google emphasized that it spent lots of time and effort in perfecting the camera so the Pixel can take great shots in low light and other less-than-ideal settings. Despite the lack of OIS, it should also be capable of taking incredibly well-stabilized video by using its gyroscope. We’re still not clear on all the details, but we’ll definitely be doing a shootout between the Pixel and the S7 once we get our hands on it. Software, Support, and Peripherals Software is going to be one of the biggest differentiators between the Pixel and the S7. The Pixel runs a version of Android 7.0 Nougat, as Google intended, while the S7 is still on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, with plans to get the update at some point soon. That means the Pixel provides the purest Android experience—free from bloatware, heavy UI layers, carrier pre-installs, and the sluggish updates that characterize most other Android phones, including the S7. There’s no doubt that Samsung’s TouchWiz UI packs in lots of useful features, like split-screen, glove mode, the always-on screen for notifications; but it also bogs down the device. The Pixel is free of that, consisting of Google’s suite of apps. Even the Verizon-exclusive phones shouldn’t have any bloatware. Aside from aesthetics like round icons, Google is bringing useful features to Nougat, like Google Assistant, which takes Google Now to the next level by giving you a complete voice assistant powered by machine learning. The one, huge selling point of the Pixel is the fact that it comes with 24/7 live customer support for the phone. There’s even a screen-share option to allow the agent to see your phone’s screen. The Pixel will also be first Android phone to get every new update. Google is leaps and bounds ahead of Samsung in this category so that’s an experience you just won’t get on the S7. Both phones have dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC with Android Pay, and LTE band support for every major U.S. carrier. Price, Availability, and Conclusions The Google Pixel comes in three colors—Very Silver, Quite Black, and the limited-edition Really Blue—at a starting price of $649 for its 32GB model. The 128GB model is $100 more, at $749. It is available for preorder through the Google Store, Verizon, and Best Buy. These prices are in line with most other top-tier phones, including the Galaxy S7. On T-Mobile and most other carriers, the phone is available for $689.99 for its 32GB model (the only capacity you can get in the U.S.). That’s actually more expensive than the base price of the Pixel. Overall, while it’s true that the Pixel is more expensive than last year’s Nexus 5X, that’s because it’s intended to be. The Pixel is a phone that looks capable of going toe-to-toe with the S7 and iPhone 7. It comes with a newer processor, reliable updates, 24/7 support, Google Assistant, and what sounds like a seriously capable camera. If software is important to you, the Google Pixel is shaping up to be a great option for Android users. On the other hand, if you love beautiful screens and a rich array of features, the Galaxy S7 remains an excellent phone.

In case you missed it, Google on Tuesday rolled out a variety of new devices, everything from smartphones -- the Pixel -- to Google Home and Google Wifi. Oh and it unveiled Google Assistant, which ties everything together with a witch's brew of artificial intelligence and voice recognition. The prospect of Google listening in at home has Multimedia Editor Keith Shaw worried about privacy -- and firmly wearing his tin-foil hat -- as he and Executive News Editor Ken Mingis decipher what Google is up to. Are we now living in a future where our devices "know" more about us and what we need than we want them to know? Is "OK, Google, turn on the lights" the 2016 equivalent of "Open the pod bay door, Hal"? Probably not. But technology is clearly headed that way, and Google's new products and services represent a big push in that direction. The only hitch: that little thing called privacy. Shifting gears, Mingis also points viewers (and readers here) to IDGE's special report, Hacking the Election, which looks at the myths and realities behind efforts to hack this year's presidential election.

Later in the year, Lenovo announced that the device would be releasing during the summer, only be to delayed yet again, apparently to November… Speaking to Google’s head of VR and AR, Clay Bavor, CNET was able to confirm that the Lenovo PHAB 2 Pro would be releasing during the month of November, although a specific release date wasn’t confirmed. As previously announced, the PHAB 2 Pro will pack a mammoth 6.4-inch display, Snapdragon 652 processor (with special optimizations for Tango), 4GB of RAM, a 4,000 mAh battery, and a rear fingerprint sensor. There’s nothing particularly special about that spec package, but when combined with a few software and camera tricks, it becomes something a bit more unique. Aside from a primary 16MP camera, there are also two rear-facing cameras on the back of the device work together to help the device better know what’s around it. The wide-angle and depth-sensing sensors allow the device to map physical spaces. This lets users interact with augmented reality games, navigate through indoor spaces, and even see what objects might look like in their homes in actual size. Pricing for the PHAB 2 Pro lands at a reasonable $499, although we don’t expect it to sell particularly well. Rather, this device is meant to make Tango readily available for those who will use it, and continue to push the tech forward. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

According to the company, more than 20 million students are now using Chromebook in their education environment. In a blog post, Google’s Rajen Sheth made the announcement, claiming that “more than 20 million students worldwide are using Chromebook to create, collaborate, and communicate.” Google’s announcement comes as a celebration of World Teachers’ Day, with the company giving credit to the teacher’s who change the course of their students’ lives. The 2o million active users number is up from the 10 million users reported at this point last year. Chromebooks have long been believed to be successful in education, with Google even taking the lead over Microsoft and Apple. One thing that will continue to help the growth of Chromebooks in education is the rollout of the Play Store on Chrome OS. In terms of the overall market, a report back in August claimed that we will see over 17 million Chromebooks out in the wild by 2023. Google also today announced a way for teachers to share their creativity with one another; Education on Air. This program is designed to help educators collaborate with one another, no matter where they are in the world and comes following its successful start last year. Today we’re announcing a way for teachers to share their creativity with one another: Education on Air, a free online conference to celebrate educators around the world and allow teachers to learn from each other. Last year at the first Education on Air, more than 50,000 participants from almost every country heard from First Lady Michelle Obama, LeVar Burton, Michael Fullen and hundreds of educators about education and technology. This year, you can choose from 100+ sessions and engage with educators globally around key themes: It takes a teacher to spark creativity: keynotes on skills of the future from Julia Gillard, Linda Darling Hammond, Professor Robert Winston, Jennie Magiera and many more. It takes a teacher to improve student learning: research on how educators have transformed schools and measured their impact. It takes a teacher to prepare students for the world: tips and tools to help boost student engagement, collaboration and productivity in the classroom. Google’s Education on Air will take place on December 3rd. More information can be found here.

It was the “tiny” Nexus that offered a beautiful mix of hardware at an attractive (and more importantly), reasonable price. The phone will forever hold a soft spot in my heart as the best Nexus device Google ever offered. It was fast, small, and didn’t break the bank. That’s not to say the phone was perfect. Compromises had to be made to keep that lower price point and as a result, the Nexus 5 was a plastic phone that featured a sub par camera and lack luster battery life. With last year’s Nexus 5X, we saw Google finally throwing Android fans a bone, those who have been craving a worthy 5-inch followup they could easily use with one hand. The 5X seemingly gave us everything we asked for — only it didn’t. The hardware was mid-range, build quality was cheap, and the price tag was much higher than we expected for something billed as a smaller, more affordable option to the Nexus 6P. It was beginning to sound like Google would never again offer a worthy, high-end, followup to the Nexus 5 — and a true 4.7-inch iPhone competitor — that fans were really clamoring for. Well, this fan anyway. Enter the Google Pixel. Yesterday Google officially took the wraps off their new line of handsets, which — according to Google — was built entirely by them. Of course, we all know the phone was technically built by HTC according to Google’s specifications, giving the search giant complete control over the premium hardware sourced they claim was sourced “from multiple partners.” I got the chance to go hands-on with the Pixel and after spending a short amount of time with the device, here are some of my first impressions. What I loved about the Pixel The Pixel phone is small – Last year I was cursing the Google gods that they didn’t release a Nexus 5P for small, premium phone lovers. Even though the Nexus 5X was pretty much awful, that’s not to say there weren’t other good Android options at this size (the HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 are both great). Unfortunately for those wanting an uncompromised Android experience with updates straight from Google — you were assed out. Again. The 1080p display is just what the doctor ordered – While it may not be best suited for VR, the 1080p display on the regular-sized Pixel is perfect at 5 inches. Having a lower — but still plenty crisp — resolution display will be less taxing on the processor. Couple this with the power savings of AMOLED and you’re looking at potentially great battery life, even from the phone’s somewhat disappointing 2,770mAh battery. In theory, anyway. It’s fast, really fast – We’ve gotten to the point where nearly every smartphone released these days is going to be snappy and responsive. Unfortunately, this was far from the case with last year’s Nexus 5X. I even had some issues with touch screen latency on the HTC 10 and constant apps reloading on the Galaxy S7. Thankfully, the Pixel I got to play around with was incredibly responsive to the touch, and super snappy with opening apps. You know, when it wasn’t freezing on me (the pains of early hardware/software). Seamless Android updates straight from Google – The Pixel will be one of the first phones to offer seamless updates straight from Google. Like Nexus devices before it, it’s hard to put a value on not having to wait months — even years — for the major Android updates to hit your device. The best part is these updates will take place entirely in the background, without you having to do a thing on your end (aside from performing a quick reboot). 24/7 tech support from Google – The Pixel features a separate tab in the Settings app focused entirely on tech support. Users can call, chat, or share their screen to get help with their device no matter where they’re at. Although nobody can match the convenience of being able to walk into a brick and mortar store and receiving help in-person with your device, Google could be getting close. The camera is top notch – In our brief time with the Pixel, the camera hardware and software was top notch. I feel like every smartphone camera has its own unique “signature” or look to it. DxOMark’s rating aside, the Pixel was seemingly on par with the iPhone 7, which is really saying something. I will note, I only got to play around with the Pixel camera inside of Google’s venue and will need to test it out in more challenging lighting situations to make a final verdict. But in our quick comparison test, it seems Google nailed it. The small Pixel is just as good as the big Pixel – With the exception of a smaller battery, the regular-sized Pixel is every bit as good as the Pixel XL. With last year’s Nexus 5X being a severely handicapped version of the Nexus 6P, I was worried the regular sized Pixel would feature subpar hardware like a lower-end processor or less RAM. This is not the case. What I didn’t like about the Pixel Build quality didn’t feel all that premium – Okay, so the Pixel features a metal unibody design typical on most high-end smartphones these days. I’m not sure if it was the weight (the Pixel is deceptively light), or the type of metal used on the phone, but the Pixel felt more like those cheap Chinese smartphones with aluminum builds — not the premium metal alloy used on Samsung’s Galaxy S7/Note 7, or the iPhone. Even the HTC 10 felt more solid (which again, could be a weight thing), but I’d be lying if I said the phone felt premium just because Google wrapped some tin foil around it. It’s thicker than a Snicker – The Pixel is thick little smartphone, a good 8.58mm at the top. While it’s far from huge, when compared against the iPhone 7 (7.1mm) and the Galaxy S7 (7.9mm), you’ll understand why the Pixel doesn’t have an unsightly camera hump. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear Google (or HTC) put the Pixel’s added thickness to good use as the battery is still quite small, weighing in at only 2,770mAh. While mAh doesn’t always translate to better battery life, it would have been nice to see them making the effort to at least squeeze a 3,000mAh battery in there. If the Galaxy S7 could do it, so can the Pixel. The size of the bottom bezel is ridiculous – Critics have been giving the Pixel a lot of sh*t about this since the phones were first leaked. I was holding off until the event to see if there was some sort of significance to having such a large bottom bezel (perhaps the option to use capacitive keys or something), but nope. All that wasted space on the bottom is just because. It’s easy to see how Google could have made better use of that space with a front facing speaker, Quad DAC, or extra big battery. Instead, it appears the sole reason for the extra large bezel is to merely make the phone look more like an iPhone. Fingerprint sensor on the back -This, of course is subjective, but a good case could made for using a front mounted fingerprint sensor. For one, it would make use of that wasted space beneath the display, and two, you could easily unlock your phone without having to pick it up off a desk or table. There’s no 64GB model – While everybody has different needs when it comes to storage on their smartphone, it was nice to see Google not wasting time with a 16GB model. That being said, Google also made the odd decision to omit a 64GB model, instead offering only 32GB and 128GB storage configurations — WTF? I get it, cloud storage makes 32GB a little more feasible, if you’re planning on using the phone for the next two years, 64GB would have been ideal. 128GB is not only excessive, but costs an extra $100 on an already expensive smartphone. It’s expensive as hell – You’d think that by making their own smartphone, having greater control over the hardware on the Pixel would see something a little more competitively priced. Not the case. Instead what you get is a smartphone that’s just as expensive as the iPhone 7 or current Galaxy smartphones, only offering a little bit less when it comes to raw features. There’s no water proofing, the battery is smaller, it’s not all that premium feeling — exactly where’s the value here? ***** Let’s be real. The Pixel is still the best option for those wanting a top-of-the-line, pure Android experience with constant updates directly from Google. It’s the new Nexus and for the first time in a long time, it’s one you aren’t forced to use with two hands. To me, this is the Pixel’s biggest draw. Whether it will be the mainstream hit Google wants it to be remains to be seen, but those that still look back on the Nexus 5 with rose tinted glasses will find the high-end hardware of the Pixel irresistible. local_offer    Google   Pixel   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (82) stars Further Reading New Google Live Cases available Google accounts suspended for reselling Pixel phones OnePlus 3T charging proves solid Allo gets themes, emoji suggestions, and more Google and Facebook are challenging bogus websites stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Weighing in on a trade secret case that could have dramatic implications for free speech on the Internet, EFF told the Supreme Court of Canada in a brief that courts should be extremely reluctant to use their authority to decide what users around the world can see on the Internet. A court in British Columbia vastly overstepped, EFF said, when it issued an injunction in 2014 to “disappear” websites that not only applied to Google’s Canada-specific search, Google.ca, but to all of its searches around the world. “The court’s overbroad ruling against Google, which had done nothing wrong and wasn’t a party in the lawsuit, put the private commercial interests of one company ahead of the interests of Internet users worldwide. That’s wrong and the Supreme Court of Canada should fix it,” said EFF Frank Stanton Legal Fellow Aaron Mackey. “Any request to issue an order in a local legal battle that affects the rights of users around the world should face a very high bar. Such orders may conflict with other nations’ laws and set the stage for authoritarian governments to impose their own speech-restricting laws on the Internet.” In the underlying case, British Columbia-based Equustek Solutions accused Morgan Jack and others, known as the Datalink defendants, of misappropriating designs for its routers and selling counterfeit routers online. It claimed California-based Google facilitated access to the defendants’ sites. The defendants never appeared in court to challenge the claim, resulting in a default judgment against them. Although Google is not named in the lawsuit, it voluntarily took down specific URLs that directed users to the defendants’ products and ads under the local Google.ca domains. But Equustek wanted more, and the British Columbia court ruled that Google must delete the entire domain from its search results, including from all other local domains such Google.com and Google.go.uk. An appeals court upheld the decision. EFF’s brief argues that the order issued by the British Columbia court violates both international free expression principles and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. “The Canadian court order is an overbroad gag on an online speaker’s ability to publish truthful information about websites that are readily accessible on the Internet,” said EFF Staff Attorney Vera Ranieri. “The order also unlawfully restricts Internet users’ rights to access the information on those websites, which has the real potential to chill speech and access to information on the Internet. We hope the Supreme Court of Canada fixes it—and other courts around the world take heed.” For the brief: https://www.eff.org/document/eff-equustek-briefsupreme-court-canada Contact:  Aaron Mackey Frank Stanton Legal Fellow amackey@eff.org Vera Ranieri Staff Attorney vera@eff.org Related Cases Google v.

By Jason Cipriani | October 5, 2016 -- 20:20 GMT (13:20 PDT) | Topic: Mobility (Image: James Martin/CNET) Google on Tuesday declared itself a hardware company, unveiling its own Wi-Fi product, a new Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Daydream View, and two new phones. Why pay a premium when every phone runs the same apps? When you start talking about a $400 to $600 difference in price, the mystique and perceived advantages of a brand and OS platform starts to look a bit silly. Read More There's little doubt that Google's newest smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, are tempting. Both devices are designed and built by Google and include some features you won't find on other Android devices, including the Nexus line (for the time being). However, there's a downside to Google's new hardware initiative: the price. Gone are the days of inexpensive Nexus phones, maxing out around $500. Google's Pixel line starts at $649 and max out at $869, depending on model and storage amount. For someone looking for a capable Android phone on a budget, let me present you with the OnePlus 3 and Axon 7. Both of these devices are loaded with features and far less expensive than the Pixel line. Below is a chart comparing the specifications of each device: Spec OnePlus 3 Axon 7 Pixel/Pixel XL Display 5.5-inch 1080p Full HD 5.5-inch Quad HD 5-inch Full HD/5.5-inch Quad HD Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Memory 6GB 4GB 4GB Storage 64GB 64GB 32GB or 128GB Expandable Storage No Yes No Camera 16-megapixel rear/8-megapixel front 20-megapixel rear/8-megapixel front 12.3-megapixel rear/8-megapixel front Operating System Android 6.0 Marshmallow Android 6.0 Marshmallow Android 7.1 Nougat Daydream Ready No Yes Yes Battery 3,000mAh 3,250mAh 2,770mAh/3,450mAh Dimensions 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm 151.7 x 75 x 7.9mm 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm/154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm Price $399 $399 $649/$769 32GB. $749/$869 for 128GB. The OnePlus 3 and Axon 7 are respectable devices in their own right, with the Axon 7 having a slight advantage over the OnePlus 3 thanks to its QHD display and Daydream compatibility (pending a software update from ZTE). Performance wise, it's hard to say exactly how much faster the Snapdragon 821 processor or what camera performance is like on the Pixel. Google really talked up the Pixel's camera performance, touting DxOMark's rating of the Pixel camera as earning the highest score for mobile camera ever. But, as we've seen in the past, when Google has touted Nexus camera performance as finally competing with the likes of Samsung and Apple, we were let down. Until we have units and are able to thoroughly test Google's boasting, we can't directly compare the Pixel, OnePlus 3, and Axon 7. On the spec sheet, at least, all three of these devices are comparable to one another. With the biggest difference between them being the amount of money you have to spend, and for some, that's more than enough to stay away from Google's latest wares.

Google is beginning to look, and feel, a lot more like Apple. (Photo: Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO — If Google's product bonanza Tuesday seemed familiar — a new line of pricey smartphones, a snazzy voice-activated service and a virtual-reality headset — it wasn't by accident. The hardware-software double play was decidedly Apple-like. It's no coincidence because, frankly, Google is beginning to look, and feel, a lot more like Apple. And that could mean a major shake-up in a tech industry roiled by questions over Apple's innovation and declining iPhone sales, exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, an expected sale of Twitter, and a mad scramble by nearly everyone else to bolster their cloud-computing services. “The market has co-opted the Apple playbook in some ways,” says Matthew Quint, director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership at Columbia Business School. From a design perspective, he said, Google's new Pixel phone "is as close as possible in look to an iPhone than anyone, including Samsung.” (Google has aligned with Samsung in the latter’s patent design dispute with Apple that goes before the U.S. Supreme Court next week.) There is a sea change at the Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif., with a product strategy and approach straight out of the playbook at Infinite Loop in Cupertino, Calif. In short, Google is constructing a digital empire of devices and services, run from one platform, to compete with Apple's cohesive, polished ecosystem. It is developing a system to control sleek consumer-electronic products, software and services. Google's new consumer electronics devices will be displayed in a pop-up shop in New York City on Oct. 20.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY) In other words, the days of Google's fragmented Android approach are over. "Google seems to have finally embraced the old maxim that if you're serious about software, you need to make your own hardware," says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. The Pixel line, Dawson says, is "a recognition that the best hardware products come from the companies that make the operating systems, which has been Apple's strategy all along — and Microsoft's more recently with the Surface and phones." USA TODAY The 5 times Google trolled Apple at Pixel event And, based on Tuesday's small sample size, it seems a wise path: Google is creating a more uniform experience for users. The strategic gambit is exemplified in Pixel and Pixel XL, Google's new smartphone product line. Priced at an iPhone-like $649 ($769 for the XL), the sleek phones represent an improvement from their predecessor, Nexus, which at times seemed like a hobby rather than product line. HTC is assembling the new Google phones. Google unveiled its Daydream VR product.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY) The phones featured high-end specs. But the real bragging rights came from the Google Assistant, Google's version of Siri that, as Google would point out, leverages the artificial intelligence and machine learning its been developing for years — through its PC-based search then through its extensive mapping and finally in efforts like AlphaGo, the program that beat a human champion at a notoriously difficult game board game. It was hard not to see the litany of examples of what Assistant could do in the light of Apple's improved but still-limited Siri digital assistant. The new phones also touted nifty features: cameras that snap photos faster; longer battery life; and free, unlimited storage, the kind of shopping list Apple likes to trot out at its product launches to oohs and aahs. . A video promoting the Pixel also embraced something now missing on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: "3.5-mm headphone jack satisfyingly not new." In the background, someone coughs "ahem." Google had more fun at the expense of Apple, poking fun at its South Bay neighbor by announcing Pixel comes in three colors — quite black, very silver and really blue. Several weeks earlier, Apple unfurled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in black and jet black. Google rounded out its bag of goodies with Google Assistant, a super-smart digital helper; a new Home Internet-connected speaker device; a WiFi system; and Daydream View, a VR headset. It's the sort of hardware-software treasure trove that Steve Jobs once imagined, and spoke of. USA TODAY The new Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7 Google's gambit isn't unique, nor is it flawless. Its retail strategy has struggled in getting gadgets to consumers, and it does not have stores, as Apple does, to display its wares. But it does have apparent momentum at a time when its smartphone rivals face obstacles. As Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin points out, Google and Microsoft — with its Surface table strategy combining hardware and software — are emulating Apple. "It is a recognition that tightly integrating hardware and software will always yield the best customer experience," he says.

Conversely, nothing says loser more than an international brand being relegated to the minor league of contract work. Google, of Android operating system fame, released its first Pixel smartphones Tuesday to replace its Nexus lineup. HTC has been selected to assemble the device, becoming for Google what Foxconn is to Apple. "Google has done the design work and a lot of the engineering," the Mountain View-based company's hardware chief Rick Osterloh told Bloomberg News.  Ouch! That's gotta hurt. After spending years building its design and engineering chops, HTC has been demoted to water boy. Supplying Google with smartphones isn't a victory -- it's an embarrassing end to HTC's decade-long campaign to break out of that contract-manufacturing business and stand on its own two feet. Biggest reason for HTC's demise Bad marketing There was a time when HTC wasn't just the biggest Android smartphone maker, but the only Android smartphone maker. It was the first to make handsets for Microsoft's mobile software, the first to make a 3G smartphone, the first to add GPS, and the first to manufacture devices using Google's operating system. HTC's brand was so successful it made Interbrand's global top 100 list in 2011, the same year it pipped Apple and Samsung to briefly and gloriously top the U.S. smartphone market. Now, HTC can barely ship a few crates of phones each quarter -- its share has shrunk so much it shows up under the ignominious category marked "other" in market research. Head Scratching HTC continued to cut spending on sales, marketing and advertising even after signing Robert Downey Jr. as a brand ambassador Source: Bloomberg How it managed to squander such an early lead can't just be put down to discount wars started by the likes of Xiaomi. Nor can it be blamed on a Nokia-like failure to evolve its product range in line with consumer tastes. HTC has kept up with, and very often led, every development in smartphones over the past 20 years, from faster chips to better cameras and improved screen resolution. At fault is a fundamental failure of leadership in both design and marketing. For years, HTC refused to change its form factor, even as Apple kept setting new benchmarks in hip and Samsung learned you can make a smartphone that doesn't look ugly. Compare and Contrast HTC's stock has declined as rivals' shares did the opposite Source: Bloomberg When it did come up with something cool -- its M-series One phones  -- management couldn't be bothered with marketing. At a time when Samsung's ad spend topped the GDP of a Third-World nation, HTC spent $12 million signing Robert Downey Jr. only to then cut its annual marketing budget, thus failing to leverage its newly acquired star. It didn't help that management later decided to load the company's expensive flagship phones with freeware in a move that alienated its most-loyal customers. Five years after climbing to the top, HTC has lost almost 90 percent of its market value and its only hope is to convince someone, anyone, that virtual reality can be a winner. But given how it messed up smartphones and Google's entry this week into the same space, that's a stretch. If you can't be bothered with marketing, you might as well be a lowly contract manufacturer. HTC playing second fiddle to Google simply highlights its loser status. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. HTC had already used the One moniker for a series of ugly models prior to its M-series lineup. HTC unilaterally installed apps on M8 during an Android update that couldn't be removed. It was the last time I, and many others, would buy an HTC.

Nok-Noi Ricker | BDN Exhibitors at the Maine Municipal Association's 80th annual convention, held this year at the Cross Insurance Center, include around 100 different businesses from all over the state. The two-day conference began Wednesday. By Nok-Noi Ricker, BDN Staff Posted Oct. 05, 2016, at 4:25 p.m. Last modified Oct. 05, 2016, at 4:55 p.m. BANGOR, Maine — Quickly evolving technology can make cities and towns run more efficiently, make law enforcement react faster and potentially change education practices for the better, but these efficiencies come with a cost, according to David Eaves, a technology expert from Harvard University. Eaves was the keynote speaker at the Maine Municipal Association’s 80th annual convention, a two-day gathering that began Wednesday at the Cross Insurance Center. “There are tradeoffs,” Eaves, who is a government access expert, said about sharing resources and the consolidation of emails and data. “It’s cheaper. But I’m very, very nervous about it.” Eaves talked about surveillance systems, phone records, emails and even ride-sharing giant Uber finding ways to collect data about people. Story continues below advertisement. “These highly centralized systems are all connected to a centralized hub. Whoever has control of that hub has a lot of power,” said Eaves. He used Google’s email service, Gmail, as an example. “Everybody uses Gmail now. You’ve gone from hundreds of thousands of [email servers] to just one and Google manages it,” Eaves said. If that one system is compromised, it could cause problems, he said. Law enforcement officials are now quickly responding to threats posted on social media or received by email, which is a huge change from just a few years ago, Eaves said. And cities and towns, which almost all have websites, can now process permits and accept tax payments online, increasing their efficiency, he said. The redundancy of many of the online systems can be reduced, however, to provide even greater access, Eaves said. He said the United Kingdom uses one national sign-on system that allows users to access all their government-controlled programs under one roof, which reduces a lot of redundancy. “I think this is the next big battle” in the U.S., Eaves said. Baileyville Town Manager Richard Bronson said he walked away from the discussion wanting to improve the town’s website. “He makes an important point that many of our websites are not particularly user-friendly,” Bronson said. “I think his point that our websites need to get viewer input early, to make them easier to use, is another important point.” At the end of Eaves’ discussion, an audience member asked how changing technology might affect education. Eaves responded by saying that “we’ve learned” teachers should not be replaced by computer screens, but he suggests that technology could be used in a better way. “We lecture all day” and then students go home and do homework, he said, suggesting the opposite occur, with students’ homework being a video lecture and the school day spent “working with your teacher at school to [strengthen] the knowledge.” “I think that was on the edge of brilliant,” Bronson said. Augusta Mayor Dave Rollins said what he took from the discussion was that technology can be used as a tool to improve education, especially in rural areas. “There is no reason we can’t be a leader,” Rollins said. MMA spokesman Eric Conrad said Wednesday that the convention is designed to discuss the important topics member communities are concerned about or want to learn more about. Breakout sessions were held Wednesday to discuss elder scams, energy projects, medical marijuana in the workplace, dog licensing, employee leave, recycling, clean water and retail changes. Thursday discussions include Penobscot and Piscataquis County District Attorney Chris Almy talking about new laws that increase penalties for violence against firefighters, as well as talks on how to open an emergency operations center, what’s next with the merging of Lewiston and Auburn, healthy downtowns, addressing unpaid taxes and acquiring properties, the Americans with Disabilities Act, overtime and right to know. University of Maine Chancellor James Page is scheduled to speak at 9 a.m. Thursday about education in Maine, and at 1 p.m. Michael Clumpner, an instructor with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, will discuss how to prepare for and respond to “an active shooter in your community.”   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Dave Rollins as Augusta’s city manager. Rollins is the mayor of Augusta. Recommend this article SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« Mt.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Google Unveils Pixel, Pixel XL Phones, Plus Daydream View VR Headset Federal Agencies Working With States to Guard Voter Data Security Intel Starts Sampling Stratix 10 FPGA Accelerators Microsoft Squeezes Power BI Reports Into Smartphone Screens       Today's topics include Google's unveiling of its new Pixel smartphones and Daydream View VR headset, the Department of Homeland Security's effort to protect voter registration data, Intel's release of its Stratix 10 FPGAs and Microsoft's move to make it easier to use Power BI on smartphones. Google's long-rumored Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, as well as its all-new Daydream View VR headset, were finally unveiled Oct. 4 after months of speculation, bringing new entries to both markets from the giant in online search. The smartphones, which were designed and engineered by Google, are available immediately for preorder, starting at $649 for the Pixel phone, which has a 5-inch display and 32GB of onboard storage, and at $769 for a Pixel XL, which has a 5.5-inch display and 32GB of storage. The new Daydream View virtual reality headset is priced at $79 and will arrive in November. At launch, users will be able to view YouTube videos, Google Street View content, Google Play Movies and more. Voter registration officials in 21 states have contacted the Department of Homeland Security to request help in dealing with attempts to break into their voter registration systems. Responding to a letter sent from the bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reiterated his earlier messages about the willingness of his department to help states deal with cyber-attacks aimed at the voting process. So far, 20 states have experienced intrusions of sufficient severity that are considered causes for concern by DHS. The department has not said which states have been attacked. This is a significant increase since earlier this year, when only two states had reported being attacked. At this point, there are few details about what the hackers were after, although in most cases it appears it was voter registration databases rather than voting machines or the IT systems that support voting results. Intel has begun sampling its Stratix 10 programmable chips, which the company expects to use as accelerators in data center environments running compute- and data-intensive applications. In a blog post Oct. 4, Dan McNamara, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, wrote that company engineers were able to combine the chip maker's 14-nanometer tri-gate manufacturing process with its HyperFlex fabric architecture. This allowed them to develop a field-programmable gate array that will address the growing demands from end users for more performance and power efficiency as they try to manage the proliferation of smart, connected devices and the huge amounts of data they're producing. Intel is aiming the Stratix 10 FGPAs at such workloads as data center applications, cloud computing, radar and imaging systems, and network infrastructure. Power BI reports are getting a mobile makeover. What looks good on a desktop browser doesn't always translate well to mobile displays, and so Web developers are adopting responsive designs and other mobile optimizations that help content shine despite the cramped quarters. Microsoft is following suit with a preview of a new mobile viewing mode for reports authored on the company's cloud-powered business intelligence platform, Power BI. Once a user publishes a report using the Power BI Desktop client, the service automatically scales and resizes its various elements, enabling them to render properly on a variety of mobile screen sizes.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Margaret Rhodes. Margaret Rhodes Design Date of Publication: 10.05.16. 10.05.16 Time of Publication: 3:42 pm. 3:42 pm All That New Google Hardware? It’s a Trojan Horse for AI Google The focus of Google’s big hardware event this week wasn’t the hardware at all. It was Assistant, the artificially intelligent digital helper that caters to your every whim and powers your every interaction. Assistant is invisible, in the design-jargon sense. The omnipresent concierge works in the background, predicting your needs, processing your requests, and offering neatly parceled answers to your questions. You never see the cogs behind it, you merely type (or speak) a command and read (or hear) tailored responses served on screen or through a speaker. This requires more than a smartphone, which explains the gadgets Google announced Tuesday. But as Google likes to say, these are early days for a multi-portal system that includes a phone like Pixel and an Amazon Echo-like device like Home. “Five years ago, if we were talking about this, there was the belief that the phone would be the interface to everything,” says Alan Black, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University’s Language Technologies Institute. That is no longer the case. Google wants its intangible interface everywhere you are, which requires having it everywhere you are—in your pocket, in your car, in your kitchen, and so on—so it can learn everything about you and provide a personalized experience. Until now, Google only dabbled in devices, relying largely on companies like Samsung, HTC, and Motorola to provide the hardware that ran its software. The way to get the AI in front of you is to embody it in hardware. Jon Mann Now, to make its invisible AI mainstream, Google must make its own products. Two of them are especially important: Pixel, which resembles an iPhone, and Home, which looks a bit like a Glade air freshener. These portals to Google Assistant are attractive, but nothing spectacular. “There’s nothing too Earth-shattering about them. The phone is just a piece of aluminum,” says Mark Hung, a tech analyst at research firm Gartner. “What matters is the fact that you’re able to use them fairly seamlessly, through a conversational interface.” The devices, in other words, exist merely as vessels. Rick Osterloh, head of Google’s new hardware group, suggested as much when he said Google decided to build hardware so the company can “get things done without worrying about the underlying tech.” In this instance, “get things done” means deliver a rich AI experience—something Google’s spent the better part of its existence preparing for. Consider Google’s information bank, called Knowledge Graph, which has enhanced your search results since 2012. Today, it contains more than 70 billion facts. Assistant can tap that repository, and its conversational UI will only improve as it sees–and learns from—how and when people access it. More Google Tim Moynihan and Michael Calore Here’s Everything Google Announced Today Brian Barrett Google Home Is Finally Ready to Rumble With Amazon Echo David Pierce Google Pixel Sounds Like the Android Phone of Our Dreams Brian Barrett Google Pixel Upends the Android Universe This explains why Google suggests placing a Home in every room. “The way to get the AI in front of you is to embody it in hardware,” says Jon Mann, an interaction designer at Artefact. “You need the access points so that it feels ubiquitous.” Today, your primary access point probably is your phone, and your home is among the few places where it may not be at your side. If Google can convince you to sprinkle access points around, it can train you to summon Assistant wherever you want, for whatever you want, whenever you want. Shifting users toward intent-driven interactions is key to making AI work. Take this typical Spotify interaction: Open your phone, open Spotify, click to search, type what you want to hear. If you’re just listening on your phone, you’re done. Anything else takes a bit more work. “If I want to stream music to speakers in my living room, that’s multiple steps I have to take, and I have to work through discovering the trigger points on the app,” Mann says. Designers thoughtfully craft those trigger points, making sure that you see controlled amounts of information in a logical order. AI increasingly handles that. Want music? Simply say, “Play SubRosa.” The more portals to Assistant you surround yourself with, the more places you can ask for it. This is where Google’s Be Everywhere model starts getting interesting. Because the more portals you surround yourself with, the more Assistant can learn about not just how you ask for help, but where, and in what context. “If they can execute on that, it’s really going to be quite revolutionary,” Hung says. Indeed, Google already is considering how best to interact with you in a multi-portal environment; if you pose a question aloud and multiple Home devices hear your request, the nearest node will provide the answer. It’s easy to imagine how this kind of contextual awareness will add an extra dimension to Assistant’s intelligence, making it truly usable. That’s essential to meeting—and exceeding—user’s expectations. “I do think we are now moving to this state where we will expect to be able to say at any time things that will be answered by a speech interface,” Black says. Google’s decision to bake its AI into a web of devices that work together certainly indicates as much. Go Back to Top.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS SEARCH Hardware and Software Google Releases Home-Assistant Device, Wi-Fi Router System and More At an event on Oct. 4, the tech giant also launched a new phone, a streaming device and a virtual-reality headset at an event on Oct. 4. by Ethan Baron, The Mercury News / October 5, 2016 0 CEO Sundar Pichai says that the company's new "Google Assistant" will "continuously get better as we make progress with machine learning and AI." Flickr/Maurizio Pesces (TNS) — SAN FRANCISCO — Google launched a new phone, a home-assistant device, a Wi-Fi router system, streaming device and virtual-reality headset at an event Tuesday that starred the firm’s industry-leading artificial-intelligence software. “The software’s magical, and the hardware’s ‘Yeah, OK,’” said Forrester Research analyst Julie Ask. Google confirmed it will release the “Pixel” phone, which comes in two sizes and three color choices and has the artificial intelligence-powered “Google Assistant” built in. RELATEDArtificial Intelligence Update: Ensuring Chatbots Remain UnbiasedDoes Google value the privacy of cows?Is Google Too Close to Government? One Group Thinks So “We designed everything about Pixel from the industrial design to the user experience,” said Rick Osterloh, head of Google’s newly formed hardware division. “We’re building hardware with Google Assistant at its core so you can get things done without worrying about the underlying technology.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that as Google advances its work, the assistant will improve. “Assistant will continuously get better as we make progress with machine learning and AI,” Pichai said. Users can ask the assistant for help when on their device’s home screen or in any app, said Brian Rakowski, Google’s head of software management for Pixel. The Pixel’s 12.3 megapixel camera was rated by camera-testing firm DxOMark as the best ever for a smartphone, Rakowski said. The camera is integrated with Google Photos, and Pixel owners get unlimited photo and video storage in the Google Cloud. The Pixel phone comes in two sizes: a five-inch display, and a five-and-a-half-inch version. Pixel will run Google’s Nougat operating system. The battery can charge quickly, said Sabrina Ellis, from the Pixel product management team. “Pixel can get you up to 7 hours of power with just 15 minutes of charging,” Ellis said. Google’s Daydream virtual-reality system comes built-in. The firm unveiled its Daydream VR headset Tuesday as well. The Pixel phones can be pre-ordered through the Google Store, Verizon stores or Best Buy, and buyers will receive them by Oct. 20, when retail sales start. Only phones pre-ordered or bought in the Google Store are unlocked to accept various SIM cards. Phones purchased at Verizon stores or Best Buy are locked to Verizon as a carrier. The Pixel’s price starts at $649. The phone comes in “Quite black,” “Very Silver,” and a limited edition “Really Blue.” Also Tuesday, Google announced a new, modular home Wi-Fi router system, intended to allow users to deploy multiple devices to cover all areas of a home. “Traditional routers weren’t designed for the way we use Wi-Fi in the home today: we’re streaming, gaming, video chatting all throughout the house,” said Mario Queiroz, leader of Google’s hardware product management group. Pre-orders for Google WiFi start in November, and the devices will ship in December, Queiroz said. It costs $129, or three for $299. Google’s Chromecast streaming device, which has sold 30 million units, has been upgraded to “Chromecast Ultra,” compatible with 4K video, Google announced. At $69, the devices will be available in November. Perhaps the most eagerly awaited new Google product is the Google Home virtual-assistance device that the firm announced in May at its developers conference. On Tuesday, the company revealed more about Home, which contains Google’s “Assistant,” and is voice controlled, providing computer-voice answers. Google has entered into partnerships with Samsung, Philips, and Nest so people can use Home to control home devices, and will continue to add partners, said Google’s vice-president of product management Rishi Chandra. “We want to make sure we support as many home devices as possible,” Chandra said. The device can also answer questions, play music and TVs, and put photos up on the TV, Chandra said. Google has created “MyDay,” which lets users hear important daily information such as weather, traffic and their appointments, Chandra said. Pre-orders for the $129 Home device started Tuesday in the Google Store, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, and it will ship and become available in retail stores Nov. 4, Chandra said. Although the event revolved around hardware products, it was largely about software and money, analysts said. The Google Assistant built into the new phones and home-assistance device gets better the more personal information it has about a user, and the more information it takes in from all users, as the software’s artificial intelligence learns. That information is precious to Google, and the Assistant and new devices extend the firm’s reach, said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. “The more places that can gather information about what people are doing, the better you can create profiles and therefore the better you can advertise to people,” Moorhead said. “The more (Google knows) about you the better their ad targeting will be and the more money they can charge for advertising. If you adopted all of these technologies we saw today there’s literally no place that you can go in your home, with the exception of your bathroom, where they wouldn’t be collecting data on you — unless you take your new Pixel phone in your bathroom. “Everything Google does, you can always track back to the way they make profits, which is advertising.” The embedding of Assistant in the Pixel phones and Home represents a milestone of sorts for artificial intelligence — it’s reached a level of performance high enough to be included in new devices, said Vasant Dhar, a professor and data scientist at the NYU Stern School of Business. “For users it means that it makes life easier,” Dhar said. “A lot of the day-to-day activities just get a lot easier — you want to book a restaurant, you want to book a trip.” For Google, the Assistant provides snapshots of users’ lives, a richer source of data than what the firm gathers by monitoring people’s Google searches, Dhar said. “At the end of the day that’s what everyone’s competing for, they’re competing to know everything about you,” Dhar said. “Facebook’s doing the same thing through a different channel. Facebook is killing it. It’s a space that Google really needs to be in.” ©2016 The Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.), Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.     RELATED Artificial Intelligence Update: Ensuring Chatbots Remain Unbiased Does Google value the privacy of cows?

The Alphabet Inc unit, which has been developing autonomous cars since 2009, said its self-driving vehicles had logged two million miles (3.2 million km) on public roads, and it continues to log about 25,000 miles of test drives per week. Google has been a leader in testing autonomous vehicles on public roads, prompting traditional carmakers to step up their self-driving plans to avoid being eclipsed by the tech leader, which has yet to disclose a business strategy for its car project. Scroll down for video  A bill signed on Thursday gives self-driving the freedom to travel on public roads without steering wheels, brake pedals or accelerators and more importantly, without human drivers - such as the two shown testing Google' self-driving car The Silicon Valley-based company is focused on making cars fully autonomous, with no need for a driver, which could make driving safer and more efficient and open up transportation to the disabled and aged.  It said last year that such cars would be ready for production by 2020. Its approach stands in sharp contrast to many carmakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Tesla Motors Inc , which are moving towards autonomous driving in incremental steps, currently still requiring drivers. Tesla has said it logged over 100 million miles since last October from drivers using its partially autonomous Autopilot system.

Share this article Share 15 shares But miles driven on predictable highways are easier than navigating busy city streets, said Dmitri Dolgov, head of Google's self-driving technology effort. Google's cars experience more complex situations than just following a car on the freeway, he said. 'You have to have a deeper understanding of what's on the road and to the side,' Dolgov told Reuters following a ride in a self-driving Lexus near Alphabet's Mountain View, California campus, during which the vehicle reacted to individuals in wheelchairs, pushing strollers and a car making a U-turn.  'Every time you drive it's different.' The Google car can detect whether a moving object is a child or a bicycle and anticipates that both can make fast, unpredictable movements.  The car's driving system calculates the probability of such movements and uses the results to determining how the vehicle will react. Those types of complicated social interactions are the last, most difficult element of autonomous vehicle technology, according to Dolgov. 'You get to 90 percent autonomy in 10 percent of the time and then spend 90 percent of your time on the last 10 percent,' he said. The closest company to rival Google's self-driven miles in California is auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, with 16,662 autonomous miles, according to a January report filed with state regulators. THE RACE TO SELF DRIVING TAXIS: LYFT VS. UBER General Motors & Lyft's autonomous Taxis General Motors announced a $500 million investment in Lyft earlier this year as a joint effort to develop a fleet of self-driving taxis. Although the idea seemed like a distant dream, the duo has announced plans for a testing program on public roads by 2017. This legislation only applies to a pilot project by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, which has designated two sites in California for testing. GM and Lyft plan for a testing program on public roads by 2017 that will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'include real customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city'.   In addition to the testing program, Lyft is working on a new app that will be used for the autonomous cars.  The app is still a prototype, but will list the option for an autonomous car and there is a GM OnStar assistant to answer questions or report issues while you're en route to your destination.  Uber's self-driving car Uber says the self-driving Volvo XC90 cars will have human backup drivers to begin with, but the move will surely worry the country's 327,000 Uber drivers who will eventually be replaced by autonomous vehicles. Uber co-founder and chief executive officer Travis Kalanick has said that the company's goal is to replace human drivers with driverless vehicles as 'quickly as possible'. The $300million Volvo deal will provide SUVs to Uber and see vehicles outfitted with cameras, lasers and sensors to help them navigate the city's streets. An unspecified number of autonomous Ford Fusions will also pick up passengers. The Volvo has 22 camera lenses, a laser on the roof and laser sensors at the corners. Its cameras, sensors and laser can see more than 100 meters in all directions.

In the phone world, the impact of its Pixel brand on its partners will be huge. Google had hyped the consumer event as the biggest since Android’s launch, but since it added only one new product to what is really a diminishing range of consumer experiments, the hype almost guaranteed fanbois would be disappointed. Google keeps trying to make consumer hardware. The ad giant thinks it’s a cool idea, but because it's mostly brilliant software engineers who like toys, but rarely see the light of day, it's doomed to fail. Our homes are filled with cheap consumer electronics tat, but most of it is not made by Silicon Valley and maybe never will be. So consolidation, rather than expansion, was the theme of the day. Note that before yesterday, Google flogged phones, cheapo VR nerd goggles, a home Wi-Fi router, a TV dongle and audio gear. Now Google flogs phones, cheapo VR nerd goggles, a home Wi-Fi router, a TV dongle... and a spy mic, just like Amazon Echo! Some parts of the product range have been upgraded and rebranded, but it hasn’t got any bigger or more ambitious: Google has been taking an axe to some of the wilder consumer initiatives like Chromecast Speakers, while Google Cast is in a deep coma. Belkin and Logitech sell a wider range of home tat. If you’ve been waiting for Google to shake up consumer electronics, then you’re still waiting. Google now justifies hardware products on much narrower and more utilitarian grounds: they’ve got to be a vessel for increased data collection, sold on the pretext of being “smart” or containing “AI.” The scare quotes are not accidental: this is not AI. But what Google calls AI – wouldn’t you know? – needs hods of personal data that Google couldn’t collect before. Amazon Echo impressed owners - like this one - because of advances in NLP, not "AI". Amazon is a shop, not an ad broker, so the trust relationship with consumers is quite different. And Google seems just as careless about quality. As reviewers have noted, Daydream View, the successor to the Cardboard project, is still mostly Cardboard. As Rob Price points out in his hands on, you don’t need to great graphics to do VR adequately: the graphics could be Tron-basic, or even stickmen, so long as the latencies are low so you don’t feel sick, the feedback is good, and the game worlds imaginative. But Cardboard 2.0 fails on all these counts. VR is still bifurcated into the expensive (Vive, Oculus) systems which know where you are, but tether you (and require a huge PC and take a day to set up)... and the cheap and cheerful Viewmasters that are very popular with primary school children right now. Those start at under £15 in the UK. Daydream VR is £69 – the same as Samsung’s Gear VR – but you need a Google Pixel phone. Daydream doesn't know where you are. So they may as well give it away. DPRK Marketing I enjoyed the surreal attempts – by people who really need to get out more – at imitating Apple’s marketing. This example is so odd, the author must surely be a resident (and employee) of the People’s Republic of North Korea, but seconded to Google: Yes, correct: lots of people like to walk around with a cloth box covering their eyes, so they can’t see where they’re going. Go ahead and copy it, Google. Great idea! In another instance, a product demonstrator on stage noted that the Cardboard 2.0 case had a flap to hold the Daydream VR’s remote control. “It’s that attention to detail,” he cooed. What, as opposed to the remote just rattling around inside? So much for the home tat. But the least surprising news, that Google is serious about its own brand phones, may well precipitate the long-overdue shake out of Android OEMs. It’s the moment they have been dreading since Google’s first Nexus in 2010. Have a read back to our coverage to get a sense of the fear and loathing: "It’s Google’s autistic approach to relationships," one senior phone executive told me at the time. "They don’t know what hurt they’re doing, and they don’t care." This angst abated when it became clear that Google wasn’t serious about the mass market – Nexus distribution was constrained, so you had to try really hard to get one – and Google wouldn’t hog platform features exclusively for its own phones. Before it launched, the Nexus was touted as a “superphone,” but it wasn’t all that super. As of today, neither of these constraints is true any more: Google will pack Pixel phones with exclusive goodies, and it’s going to put Pixels everywhere. To get the latest Android (7.1), get a Pixel. So where does this leave other Android makers? Google is clearly keenly focused on furthering the Pixel – its very own Pixel. If you were a C-level executive at either Sony, HTC or LG, and your flagships had lost lots of money for the company, do you think you are more or less inclined to continue investing in this loss-bleeder?

Jillian Kitchener reports. Smartphone vendors have a tough job. They need to convince consumers that theirs is the best, bar none.  Better than last year's model. Better than the competition. And not just incrementally better. Quantum leap better. Otherwise, who would want to upgrade? The narrative around the new Pixel phones is that they are so good and so different from what came before that Google even had to find a new brand name for them. So it's farewell to the Nexus — which was last year's most awesome Google smartphone — and hello to Pixel, Google's newest bestie. As Google vice president Jason Bremner put it: "Nexus was the best of Android [the Google operating system]; Pixel is the best of Google." While most consumers would probably not appreciate that subtle differentiation, the intent is clearly to make the Pixels much more than a "pure Android" phone. The Pixel phones are an entirely new created-from-scratch, flagship smartphone that combines the high-class hardware with Google's software smarts in an integrated way that, apparently, has not been done before. READ MORE: * Google goes after iPhone users with pricey Pixel smartphones * Google's Pixel may be cool, but what's the point? Reviewing a new phone at a launch event is a bit like test driving a car in a showroom. You can't do much more than kick the tires and check the comfyness of the seats. And let's face, there is a sameness now to all top-of-the-range smartphones, they all come in the "candy bar" shape, all come clad in glass and aluminum, with super-dooper high resolution screens, awesome multi mega pixel cameras and most also have a headphone jack. The Pixel and the phablet-sized Pixel XL both conform that that familiar spec described above. Save for the fingerprint sensor, which sits on the back the device. Unlike the iPhone, there is no camera bump, the lens sit flush to the surface. Also unlike the iPhone 7 and newer Samsungs Galaxys, Pixels are not promoted as being water or splash resistant. Reuters Tests by DxOMark has given the Pixel cameras a score of 89, placing it above the competition. But here are six features, in no particular order, which I think deserve special mention: 1. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has called it. The mobile first era is over and it's being replaced by the artificial intelligence (AI) era. And we thought they were called smartphones. Well apparently, you ain't seen nothing yet. But the Pixel phones are the forerunners of the next generation of really smartphones where stuff like AI, machine learning, voice and image recognition and neural networks are baked into the operating system. Google Assistant is to the Pixel as Siri is the iPhone, only she's been sucking up humanity's collective wisdom for a lot longer than Siri has. Google Assistant is part bot, part concierge, part life coach. It's how Pichai says the company will "build a personal Google for each and every user". Creepy, maybe; useful, for sure. 2. It's hard enough switching from Android to Android let alone iPhone to Android. To salve the the itch to switch, the Pixel phones come with software and an adaptor you can use to tether phones together so that everything comes across rapidly and painlessly. 3. It is clear that the Pixel cameras are a cut above the competition. Tests by DxOMark, a respected independent source of camera and lens image quality measurements and ratings, has given the Pixel cameras a score of 89, placing it above the competition. Google also uses a lot of clever software to trick up the photos so that they look like they were shot with a proper single lens reflex camera. 4. The Pixels are the first to support Google's Daydream virtual reality (VR) platform. I don't think this can be underestimated as a selling point. Yes, it's early days, but turning your phone into a VR projector — once coupled with the Daydream View goggles — will bring new uses to these phones that you never knew existed. Mums and dads, lock away your new Pixel phones because someone is going to have an irresistible urge to strap them to their face for extended periods. Reuters The Pixels are the first phones to support Google's Daydream virtual reality platform. 5. Google has one-upped Apple's Genius Bar concept with built-in 24/7 support. When they say built-in, they mean exactly that. It's built into the phone so that as long as you can switch on the phone, which admittedly is sometimes the problem, you can dial up for voice or chat support. There's even a feature to screen shot and share the problem you're seeing. 6. Hoarders rejoice! Pixel owners (should we be calling them Pixies?) will get unlimited storage in the cloud for their photos and videos at the original resolution. Google Photos already provides video and photo cloud storage, but larger files are crunched down in size. Coupled with dynamic caching, which parks stuff you haven't seen for a while in the cloud, Pixel phones will never run out of photo and video storage space. No New Zealand prices or availability dates have been released. The author attended the launch in San Francisco as a guest of Google.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc.’s Google on Tuesday announced a new “Pixel” smartphone and a suite of new consumer electronics products for the home, planting itself firmly in the hardware business and challenging Apple Inc.’s iPhone at the high end of the $400 billion global smartphone market. The string of announcements — including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the living room dubbed “Home,” and a new wi-fi router — is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head-to-head with Apple; Amazon.com, Inc.; and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Company executives, echoing Apple’s longstanding philosophy, said they were striving for tighter integration of hardware and software. “The thinking is that if we can work on hardware and software together, we can innovate much better,” Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview with Reuters, citing a recent reorganization that united once-disparate hardware teams. Under the new structure, the company has begun to take a much more integrated approach to things like supply chain management and design, added Mario Queiroz, a vice president of product management. “The learnings from one product are benefiting another product,” he said. Unlike earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan’s HTC Corporation will serve as the contract manufacturer. SWIPE AT APPLE Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States, Verizon Communications, Inc., on the Pixel, emulating Apple’s agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T Inc. That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. Shares of Alphabet closed up 0.3 percent, while Verizon fell 1.2 percent. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders begin on Tuesday. “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones,” industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. While the new phones are clearly aimed at competing with the iPhone — Google executives took several swipes at Apple in their on-stage remarks — analysts said Android rivals like Samsung Electronics could be the biggest victim if the Pixel takes off. Google’s strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89 percent of the global market, according to IDC. But Apple still rules the high end of the market, and Google has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. ALL-PURPOSE ASSISTANT Google kicked off the event Tuesday by touting the Google Assistant, the company’s voice-activated artificial intelligence system and its answer to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. The presenter showed how a customer could make a restaurant reservation with a few phrases spoken into the phone. The assistant will be embedded into the Pixel and Home products and is being positioned as the central feature in a family of integrated hardware and software products. It is one of a handful of similar assistants that are vying for supremacy as more people search the web and make purchases online using voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling digital devices. While Google is often cited as the leader in artificial intelligence, Amazon stole a march on the company with its Alexa-powered Echo home speaker system, a surprise hit. The Home device and the Echo have many of the same features. Home will also be available in November for $129. Google also unveiled a new version of its Chromecast digital media player and a router dubbed Google Wifi, both boasting the same sleek, minimalist design as the Home product. “These look like products from a single company,” said Queiroz, the Google executive.

The decision to brand the phones with the Pixel name, rather than Nexus, marks a break with the past, and is intended to signify that they were designed in house rather than by another manufacturer.

Everything you need to know about the new Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL https://t.co/wE1BMT5OAb pic.twitter.com/X77HDHgUPK— XDA Developers (@xdadevelopers) October 5, 2016 A new virtual reality headset is shortly to be available called Daydream View which will work with the new Pixel phones and other devices based on Google’s Android software. The new devices represent a big push by Google to make and sell its own hardware, instead of largely just supplying software for other manufacturers. At a starting price of roughly $650 in the US, the new Pixel phones are aimed at the same markets as Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy flagship handsets. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones,” industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. This is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head-to-head with Apple, Amazon.com and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Company executives, echoing Apple’s longstanding philosophy, said they were striving for tighter integration of hardware and software. “The thinking is that if we can work on hardware and software together, we can innovate much better,” Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said.

Consider Republic Wireless, Project Fi Buying a Google Pixel? Consider Republic Wireless, Project Fi By Sascha Segan October 5, 2016 12:25pm EST 10 Comments With the Pixel phone, Google Fi and Republic Wireless are now available on a wider range of phones. The new Google Pixel smartphone is being sold "exclusively" by Verizon Wireless, except that it's not. If you don't want to attach your Pixel to a Verizon Wireless plan, you can go straight to the Google Store and get an unlocked Pixel, including a financing plan, for $27 per month. That lets you hook up your Pixel to a wide range of service plans from major and minor carriers. But there are two special plans, which haven't historically been available with a wide range of phones, that we'd like to call out as worth looking at for Pixel purchasers. Google Project Fi Google's Project Fi virtual carrier is only available to owners of Nexus and Pixel phones. Although Project Fi may be a good buy for you, it's not always the cheapest plan available. For example, 6GB with Project Fi costs $80, while 6GB with T-Mobile is only $65, and 10GB with Straight Talk costs $55. Project Fi's advantages are that it rebates you for unused data, which can save you money if you use varying amounts of data; it also taps into the T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular networks for the best possible coverage. If you move between urban areas covered by T-Mobile and rural areas where US Cellular is strong, that can bring some major benefits. Project Fi users tend to love the service, and it won our Readers' Choice award this year. //Related Articles Hands On: Google's Pixel Smartphone Republic Wireless Republic Wireless originally became popular for offering super-low-cost, Wi-Fi-oriented service plans. Its plans have become more expensive recently (its zero-data, all-Wi-Fi plan is now $15/month, up from $10), but it does very well in our Readers' Choice awards not just because of its low prices, but also because of its high-quality customer service. Over the summer, Republic went from offering only a small selection of phones with specialized firmware to being able to run on a wider variety of Android devices. Republic confirmed that its service will work with the new Pixel and Pixel XL phones. For more, see The Best Cheap Cell Phone Plans You've Never Heard Of.

Jillian Kitchener reports. Smartphone vendors have a tough job. They need to convince consumers that theirs is the best, bar none.  Better than last year's model. Better than the competition. And not just incrementally better. Quantum leap better. Otherwise, who would want to upgrade? The narrative around the new Pixel phones is that they are so good and so different from what came before that Google even had to find a new brand name for them. So it's farewell to the Nexus — which was last year's most awesome Google smartphone — and hello to Pixel, Google's newest bestie. As Google vice president Jason Bremner put it: "Nexus was the best of Android [the Google operating system]; Pixel is the best of Google." While most consumers would probably not appreciate that subtle differentiation, the intent is clearly to make the Pixels much more than a "pure Android" phone. The Pixel phones are an entirely new created-from-scratch, flagship smartphone that combines the high-class hardware with Google's software smarts in an integrated way that, apparently, has not been done before. READ MORE: * Google goes after iPhone users with pricey Pixel smartphones * Google's Pixel may be cool, but what's the point? Reviewing a new phone at a launch event is a bit like test driving a car in a showroom. You can't do much more than kick the tires and check the comfyness of the seats. And let's face, there is a sameness now to all top-of-the-range smartphones, they all come in the "candy bar" shape, all come clad in glass and aluminum, with super-dooper high resolution screens, awesome multi mega pixel cameras and most also have a headphone jack. The Pixel and the phablet-sized Pixel XL both conform that that familiar spec described above. Save for the fingerprint sensor, which sits on the back the device. Unlike the iPhone, there is no camera bump, the lens sit flush to the surface. Also unlike the iPhone 7 and newer Samsungs Galaxys, Pixels are not promoted as being water or splash resistant. Reuters Tests by DxOMark has given the Pixel cameras a score of 89, placing it above the competition. But here are six features, in no particular order, which I think deserve special mention: 1. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has called it. The mobile first era is over and it's being replaced by the artificial intelligence (AI) era. And we thought they were called smartphones. Well apparently, you ain't seen nothing yet. But the Pixel phones are the forerunners of the next generation of really smartphones where stuff like AI, machine learning, voice and image recognition and neural networks are baked into the operating system. Google Assistant is to the Pixel as Siri is the iPhone, only she's been sucking up humanity's collective wisdom for a lot longer than Siri has. Google Assistant is part bot, part concierge, part life coach. It's how Pichai says the company will "build a personal Google for each and every user". Creepy, maybe; useful, for sure. 2. It's hard enough switching from Android to Android let alone iPhone to Android. To salve the the itch to switch, the Pixel phones come with software and an adaptor you can use to tether phones together so that everything comes across rapidly and painlessly. 3. It is clear that the Pixel cameras are a cut above the competition. Tests by DxOMark, a respected independent source of camera and lens image quality measurements and ratings, has given the Pixel cameras a score of 89, placing it above the competition. Google also uses a lot of clever software to trick up the photos so that they look like they were shot with a proper single lens reflex camera. 4. The Pixels are the first to support Google's Daydream virtual reality (VR) platform. I don't think this can be underestimated as a selling point. Yes, it's early days, but turning your phone into a VR projector — once coupled with the Daydream View goggles — will bring new uses to these phones that you never knew existed. Mums and dads, lock away your new Pixel phones because someone is going to have an irresistible urge to strap them to their face for extended periods. Reuters The Pixels are the first phones to support Google's Daydream virtual reality platform. 5. Google has one-upped Apple's Genius Bar concept with built-in 24/7 support. When they say built-in, they mean exactly that. It's built into the phone so that as long as you can switch on the phone, which admittedly is sometimes the problem, you can dial up for voice or chat support. There's even a feature to screen shot and share the problem you're seeing. 6. Hoarders rejoice! Pixel owners (should we be calling them Pixies?) will get unlimited storage in the cloud for their photos and videos at the original resolution. Google Photos already provides video and photo cloud storage, but larger files are crunched down in size. Coupled with dynamic caching, which parks stuff you haven't seen for a while in the cloud, Pixel phones will never run out of photo and video storage space. No New Zealand prices or availability dates have been released. The author attended the launch in San Francisco as a guest of Google.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Everything We Know About Google Pixel Phones Posted: Oct 5 2016, 1:39pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     Here is an overview of Google Pixel phones announced yesterday. Okay so the long rumored Google Phones are finally out and we simply can’t get our eyes off of them. The new introduced phones are known as Pixel and Pixel XL. These phones are quite a big deal for Google as they happen to be the first flagship Android Phones which will not be using the previous ‘Nexus’ brand name. Don't Miss: The Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad The newly introduced Pixel phones will actually reflect Google’s idea of user and phone direct interaction. However the phones still contain many of the characteristics found in a Classic Nexus. For example they have a little to no wireless carrier modifications. This feature automatically makes them the purest version of Android you can get your hands on. These devices will also be one of the first to receive updates when they come out. The Pixel XL is available in three colours in the US. They include ‘very silver’, ‘quite black’ and ‘really blue’. The colours are good but nothing you haven’t seen before. Google Assistant One of the most exciting features of Pixel is the usage of Google Assistant. This artificial intelligent companion is similar to Siri but the underlying difference is that it is powered by the all knowing Google search engine and thus is able to answer more elaborately and perform much complicated tasks. The Google Assistant works great for Android users and can be a big help in finding photos making plans and operating your smart home. Many people are looking forward to this feature because it is anticipated to give a better experience than Siri. ‘Ok Google’ are the magic words which activate Google Assistant on Pixel or you may simply press and hold the home button. The assistant can help you out on your task if you’re on your home screen or even in an app for that matter.For instance, ‘show me photos from previous june’ will display images in your phone from that date. Fingerprint Users having experience with the Nexus 6P and 5X will obviously be attracted to the new Pixel phones and will immediately recognize that finger print sensors are like before on the back of the smart phones. This was a very peculiar choice made by Google but we actually like it that way. The finger print reader placed on the back actually feels easier to use instead of placing a thumb on the home button. You will get used to it in no time. 3.5 mm audio jack and waterproof Wired headphone users are in for a relief as both the Pixel phones have a headphone jack. The Pixel phones are actually made to compete with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus directly and to be honest most of the hardware is compatible enough. Even though the hardware is competing with the iPhone the Pixel is still not water proof or dustproof as most flagship Android phones usually are.This is even more surprising as the iPhone 7 includes both the features. The headphone jack might be bait for some people but our advice would be to ignore that and go for other features of the Pixel. Specifications The new phones have a huge improvement in the hardware when compared to the older models. Both the Pixels have a Snapdragon 821 Processor which gives them a more improved ability to run 4K videos and operate multiple apps. Both the phones are also loaded with 4GB of RAM. In comparison the Nexus 6P had Snapdragon 810 processor. Display The Pixel XL features a 5.5 inches screen with 534ppi whereas the smaller Pixel has a 5-inch screen with 441ppi. This is almost the same as last year’s Nexus 5X. We are pretty excited as to how these phones will perform in our hands on tests. Camera The Pixel phones have a 12-megapixel rear camera which is quite good for an average user. However the Pixel phone camera will not perform well in low light and will give poor results in comparison to the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S7. This is because the Pixel has a f/2.0 lens whereas he iPhone 7 has f/1.8 and Galaxy S7 has a f/1.7. However these specifications have not prevented Google from boasting the camera abilities. Believe it or not the Pixel phones have an 89 DXO Mark Mobile rating which is the highest rating any phone has ever got. Now that is pretty impressive in itself.Google is claiming that it has made the best camera phone but we will be only assured once we have seen it. USB-C One of the last things to come in notice about the Pixel Phones is that they are making use of USB-C ports for chargers. This quality is pretty rare because even though numerous products do rely on USB-C chargers for charging the most popular phones Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 don’t. Now that Pixel is using the USB-C for charging it will definitely set a new trend. Pricing and Carrier A huge bummer is that these phones will be exclusive to Verizon. This will actually make the phones fall short of the main stream attention Google is in hope for. However, the silver lining is always there and in this case Google store will have the Pixel unlocked. The Pixel Phones come with a heavy price tag. The phones have a price starting from $650 and will be available for pre order from today.   You May Like The Author Ahmed Humayun Ahmed Humayun is a technology journalist bringing you the hottest tech stories of the day.     Advertisement Leave a Comment Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News Tesla's Solar Roof to be Cheaper than Regular Roof Even without Energy Factor Says Musk 2 hours ago Coca-Cola Selfie Bottle Unveiled 4 hours ago South Korea Refuses Google Access to Afficial Map Data 4 hours ago Now Users can Launch Facebook's Safety Check 6 hours ago Nokia Announces Machine Learning based Customer Solutions 17 hours ago, 2:54pm CST Victoria’s Secret Angel Elsa Hosk Reveals Secret to Body Confidence 11 minutes ago Colbert: The New Apple Book Delivers Something Truly Extraordinary 13 minutes ago The North Pole is 36 Degrees Warmer Than Normal 25 minutes ago Victoria's Secret Black Friday 2016 Deals and Tote Announced 37 minutes ago Victoria's Secret Angel Martha Hunt Reveals Her Hard Workout Routine 1 hour ago Top Black Friday Microsoft Xbox One S and Sony PS4 Deals 1 hour ago McLaren Working on a Three-Seat F1-Inspired Hyper-GT 2 hours ago Scientists Hacked Photosynthesis to Boost Crop Yields 2 hours ago NES Classic In Stock at Walmart at 5pm Last Time 2 hours ago Hyundai Introduces new Autonomous IONIQ Concept at LA Motor Show 3 hours ago Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Target Black Friday 2016 ad Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad All Black Friday 2016 ads How to Find Hatchimals Deals Find NES Classic Deals Featured News Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Announced Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Released   How to Beat Bots to Buy Nintendo NES Classic at Walmart Each Day at 5pm Top 100 Black Friday 2016 Deals That Win Black Friday Technology News Tesla's Solar Roof to be Cheaper than Regular Roof Even without Energy Factor Says Musk 2 hours ago Coca-Cola Selfie Bottle Unveiled 4 hours ago South Korea Refuses Google Access to Afficial Map Data 4 hours ago Now Users can Launch Facebook's Safety Check 6 hours ago More Technology News Stories Latest News Victoria’s Secret Angel Elsa Hosk Reveals Secret to Body Confidence 11 minutes ago Colbert: The New Apple Book Delivers Something Truly Extraordinary 13 minutes ago The North Pole is 36 Degrees Warmer Than Normal 25 minutes ago Victoria's Secret Black Friday 2016 Deals and Tote Announced 37 minutes ago More Latest News The Latest ...

No problem: the Chromecast Ultra has Ethernet. On the surface, the new Chromecast Ultra looks nearly identical to the updated streaming dongle Google introduced last fall. The main cosmetic difference is the absence of the Chromecast logo; now there's just a generic "G." On the inside, though, the Chromecast Ultra has been revamped to support streaming in 4K and high dynamic range (HDR). Its new processor and Wi-Fi radios (Google won't say what they are) mean it can load videos 1.8 times faster than other Chromecast devices, even in Ultra HD. Of course, you'd need robust Wi-Fi to support that, which might not be the case if your router is in the home office and your television is in the basement. If that's your situation, Chromecast Ultra supports Ethernet via its power brick, the first Google streaming device to do so. As with the current Chromecast, the matte side of the circular Ultra is magnetized, letting the HDMI connector stick to it when not in use. Since you'll probably plug it into your TV or receiver and forget about it, the magnet probably won't see a lot of use. At $69, the Ultra is nearly twice the price of the current Chromecast, but it's in line with other 4K streaming devices, including the recently announced Roku Premiere. //Related Articles 20 Things You Didn't Know Your Chromecast Could Do In addition to the Chromecast Ultra, Google unveiled a slew of other hardware at its event in San Francisco on Tuesday, including Google Home, its Amazon Echo rival, and a new router known as Google Wifi. Both devices unlock Chromecast's full potential. But if you're not enthusiastic about wiring your home with Ethernet, Google Wifi's easy expandability (it comes in a pack of three for $299) could deliver the robust connection you need for 4K streaming. Google Home can also beam audio to any Chromecast, including the Ultra and the Chromecast Audio speaker dongle. Instead of casting a Spotify playlist from the app on your iPhone (which drains your phone's battery) you can instead say "OK Google, play Beyoncé on my Chromecast," and let Google's Assistant do the rest. The 4K video displayed at Google's event streamed smoothly, with most of the demo Chromecast Ultras connected via Ethernet. If you don't view a lot of 4K content and have a stable Wi-Fi connection, though, you'll probably be just fine with the regular Chromecast.

It’s not necessarily an OnHub replacement, but rather gives you another cheaper option that is made by Google itself… If you only buy one, it’s a decent bit cheaper than going with either of Google’s current OnHub offerings at $129, but the true selling point of this device will require more than one — so Google will be selling a bundle of three for $299. With three routers, you should be able to completely coat your 3,000+ square foot home with seamless and reliable WiFi connectivity. But another thing to note here is that the Google Wifi is really compact, sleek, and attractive — enough so that you might be able to actually have it out in the open rather than under your desk in the corner of the room. It’s small — about half the size of the ASUS OnHub — and has a nice LED ring around the sides to show you that it’s online and working. While we didn’t get to test them out, the Google Wifi will also inherit all the best features of the OnHub system. One Google rep told us that the router will indeed use the Google On app (although the Google Wifi landing page seems to refer to it as the Google Wifi app), and you’ll be able to do things like easily share your WiFi password and control your kids’ access to the internet.

The list of Pixel-exclusive changes includes the new Pixel Launcher, the one where you swipe up for all the apps and has a new search widget. You also get the Google Assistant, which, make no mistake, is very much a Pixel exclusive feature and not coming to other Android phones. Pixel owners will also be able to backup all their photos and videos in full quality to Google Photos with no restrictions and full get full online and phone support in case something goes wrong. They will also get the new Pixel Camera app and some cosmetic changes, such as solid navigation bar icons, blue system theme, and some new wallpaper animations. As for non-Pixel devices, they'd get Night Light, which is like Night Shift on iOS and gradually cuts the blue light from the display to make it easier on the eyes, touch/display performance improvements, fingerprint sensor gestures, Daydream VR mode, seamless system updates, and more. As you can see, Google is definitely keeping some of the best bits exclusive to Pixel, but that has been the case with Android OEMs since forever where the skinned version had extra features not found in stock Android and the Pixel phones are more or less running a skinned version of Android. There is no word yet on whether 'Pixel' includes the Pixel C or just the two new phones, although if we had to guess we'd say it would just be the phones. You can find the full list of changes in the source link below. Source Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version
National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out motoring Search News Lifestyle Vehicles Road Tests Customs & Classics Bikes Motorsport Doug's house Google's self-driving cars hit another milestone, but paranoia remains MARCO DELLA CAVA Last updated 08:27, October 6 2016 REUTERS Upstarts may claim they can develop self-driving technology but nothing replaces Google's simple and often boring task of trolling the streets. Google's self-driving cars have hit another milestone on the road to the automotive future, notching two million miles (3.2 million km) on the autonomous-testing odometer. That mark, which the Alphabet-owned company announced on Wednesday (Thursday NZT), was hit as other companies spent the summer dominating the self-driving headlines. Uber recently began picking up Pittsburgh passengers in its small fleet of driverless (though driver-monitored) vehicles, while Ford announced plans to sell transportation that lacked a steering wheel and pedals by 2021. ELIJAH NOUVELAGE/REUTERS Video captured by a Google self-driving car coupled with the same street scene as the data is visualised by the car. The path towards robotic transport - so-called Level 5 autonomy, where humans need not get involved - is what the project has been travelling on for more than seven years. READ MORE: *Future cars: They'll be our guardian angels and we will share them *Google teaches its self-driving cars to honk *The future of self-drive cars *Google's self-driving car takes some blame for a crash *Will self-driving cars have morals?   And despite rivals suggesting that autonomy is around the corner, Google's self-driving car lead says his team is no where near finished with the hard work of making computers drive better than humans. "There's definitely a lot of things being said in the media, but my personal opinion is it's a lot of noise and ambiguity," project lead Dmitri Dolgov told USA Today. Dolgov was in at the 2009 ground floor of the program and takes over after the abrupt departure of longtime technical lead Chris Urmson. "I find the terminology is over-loaded, and there are big gaps between what's out there and what's working," he says. "But it's exciting." Ad Feedback Dolgov's point is clear. Upstarts may claim that they can develop self-driving technology by leveraging increasingly sophisticated machine-learning algorithms, but nothing replaces the simple and often boring task of trolling the streets. While Google's engineers have refined their systems by running many millions of miles of virtual testing, it remains a poor second place to encountering and processing real-world road encounters that range from a woman chasing ducks with a broom to buses failing to yield. In fact, the handful of accidents suffered by Google's cars to date have, so far, all been the result of human negligence on the part of the other drivers. "It's easy to build car that's always in paranoid mode," Dolgov says with a laugh. "Reacting to the world is the core of the challenge, reacting smoothly." In truth, rides in Google's self-driving Lexus vehicles do feel like driving with your overly cautious grandmother. But Dolgov insists that the cars have come a long way in the past year, and now are programmed to drive more like assertive adults. What's more, Google engineers have been working to ensure that their vehicles can process the digital data coming in from various radar, laser and camera data and translate that into their real counterparts, whether that's a cyclist waving a hand or an unexpected set of construction cones. "The social interactions that cars have are many, there are stop signs, there's merging into a gap, dealing with jaywalkers, so much," he says. "If there's a kid chasing a ball into the street, the car has to understand that's different from a jogger in the road." Dolgov is resolute that the future is not a car that offers a driver self-driving assistance, but rather a vehicle where the computer is in full control. That's a position echoed by Ford CTO Raj Nair, who said the reason Ford Motor Company is leaping to develop a Level 5 car is that the handoff from computer to human while driving is just too risky. Tesla's Autopilot system provides that sort of Level 2 assistance, allowing the car to drive itself on highways and even change lanes on its own. Recent Tesla crashes that may have involved the software program, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently upgraded, are being investigated by federal regulators. "In 2012, we ran a test with Google employees who got a car from us that would occasionally need them to take control," says Dolgov. "What we learned in that pilot strongly influenced our decision (to shoot for Level 5). People are really bad at that, they'll over-trust the system. They'll do crazy things in the car, fall asleep. Raj is correct. If system doesn't work all of the time, how do you make sure driver is capable of really taking over? Well, that's why we're focused on having no driver." The self-driving future seems less like sci-fi and more like an inevitability, and that's something the government wants to get a grip on early. California's Department of Motor Vehicles has yet to rule on whether it will allow self-driving cars without a steering wheel or pedals, a position that would great impact the Mountain View-based company's ability to test near its headquarters. "I certainly second the excitement, after all, this is the most important thing I'll do in my life," Dolgov says. "And I'm glad the technology is being taken seriously.

Taking cues from Apple, Google has finally stepped down to designing its own hardware, but not limiting itself to smartphones only. The company believes it can take full advantage and the capabilities of hardware by using its artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long been designing operating systems for its own hardware. Now Google is doing the same with its Pixel phones running company’s Android system. The Google keynote event at San Francisco on October 4 highlighted a series of new hardware, but the primary focus was on Google’s products rather than the device itself. With the five new devices announced, Google is preparing for its own eco-system and the base controller is Google’s own artificial intelligence — Assistant. Let’s take a quick glance at what Google has to offer. Pixel, Pixel XL Google announced its much anticipated smartphones, the Nexus successor Pixel (and Pixel XL), in a small event in San Francisco. The company ditched the Nexus branding for the new name Pixel, which will now be manufactured by Google themselves under the tag ‘Made by Google’. Both Pixels are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset with 4GB of RAM with a unibody design made from a combination of metal and glass and will be sh-ipped with Google’s latest And-roid version 7.0 Nougat. Google has renamed its Nexus launcher to Pixel Launcher and included Assistant, apart from bringing a slew of new features to the table. Google claims that the Pixel sports a 12.3MP rear camera and is one of the best ones out there. The came-ra also clubs with Goo-gle Photos to offer users unlimited online storage, for life. As for the hardware specs, the sm-aller Pixel will sport a 5-inch display with a full HD AMOLED panel, 2770mAh battery, 8MP front camera, USB Type-C USB 3.0, single SIM, and 32GB/128GB storage. While the two smartphones are almost identical, the Pixel XL only differs by display with a 5.5-inch qHD (2K) AMOLED display and a larger 3450mAh battery. The Google Pixel is priced at Rs 57,000 for the 32GB variant, while the 128GB variant will be selling at Rs 66,000. The Pixel XL on the other hand is priced at Rs 67,000 for the 32GB variant and the 128GB variant will be selling for Rs 76,000. The device will be up for pre-orders starting October 13. Daydream VR Google also unveiled its Daydream View, a Virtual Reality (VR) headset at the event. The VR headset will come with a companion motion controller, a feature missing from other conventional VR headsets till date. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can fun-ction like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Google also plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers to make Daydream headsets and contro-llers. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79 and will be available in three different colours. Google Home Google Home is company’s answer to Amazon’s smart home speaker ‘Echo’. Google Home will be able to perform many of the same tasks similar to Amazon’s Echo. However, Home will have Google’s AI Assistant, which can connect and control many of Google’s hardware in the same network. Voice commands from the user can be used to completely control the other hardware, for example, play music, field questions, search for information and control home appliances. Google Home will be available from November, pre-orders have already started. Price starts at $129 with a 6-month free subscription of YouTube Red. Chromecast Ultra Google announced the next iteration of its media streamer Chromecast, dubbed as the Chromecast Ultra. The new video-streaming Chromecast Ultra will now support 4K resolution videos for larger displays. It will challenge Amazon’s Fire TV, which also supports 4K resolution, but is fairly cheaper than the latter. The Amazon Fire comes at a hefty price of $100, while the Chromecast Ultra is priced at a mere $69. Google Wi-Fi Google also aims to improve Wi-Fi networks in homes by offering its own home-brewed wireless router — Google Wi-Fi. The company believes that people use the internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the entire space of the house. The new routers can beam to a farer distance by clubbing each other’s powers in combination to create a broader range of operation. The new Google Wi-Fi system will cost about $130 for a single unit, while a three-pack option for larger homes will come in at a cheaper cost about $300.

Alibaba Founder and CEO, Jack Ma meeting with David Cameron the then UK Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street during his visit to London in October 2015. number10gov/flickr, CC BY-NC Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn As the financial media speculates about Twitter being acquired by Salesforce, Alphabet (formerly Google) or even Apple, companies outside the Californian tech scene have received little attention as potential suitors. There’s now clear interest, appetite and capacity for cross-border mega deals in online tech, as Tencent’s acquisition of Supercell in June this year has shown. “Asian strategic investment in European Tech firms has grown steadily over the last decade but this year it has gone through the roof” says London-based Jack Fisher, Senior Business Development Manager of Global Deals Data provider, PitchBook. Tencent is China’s largest online social media and gaming company. Its landmark majority investment in Finland’s Supercell (makers of the global smash hit mobile game Clash of Clans) valued the 200-person company at US$10.2 billion. This crowned it as Europe’s first “Decacorn” or private startup online tech company to reach a valuation of more than US$10 billion. In June 2016 Finland’s Supercell (and maker of Clash of Clans) became Europe’s 1st Decacorn (Private tech co valued at over $10Bn) thanks to a majority investment from China’s Tencent. bata/flickr In another Transatlantic mega deal, Japanese Tech Investment Giant SoftBank’s US$31.4 billion back in July acquisition of British chip designer ARM Holdings, whose success has been buoyed by the use of their chips in tens of billions of web connected devices for Apple, Samsung and others is the biggest ever purchase of a European technology company ever and SoftBank’s largest overseas acquisition. In September last year, China’s other online giant Alibaba hired Michael Evans, the former Vice-Chair of Goldman Sachs, to lead the company’s quest for offshore expansion. Evant has since overseeen five acquisitions, all worth more than US$200 million, and each of them outside China - in Singapore, India, Hong Kong and the US. The latest one is the largest yet — a US$1 billion deal for a controlling stake in the number one South-East Asian e-commerce startup, Singapore based Lazada Group. While Twitter may not be on the radar of overseas investors, there is now a large and growing stream of international global mergers and acquisitions in the technology sector every month. Cross-border deal flow has steadily increased each year since the emergence of the web and shows how the new economics of “online gravity” is accelerating globalisation. This new economics has helped forge the five most valuable companies in the world right now — each now valued at more than US$300 billion. They include Apple (with a fortune built on the web connected iPhone), Alphabet (formerly Google), Microsoft (now parent to LinkedIn and Skype), Amazon and Facebook. Two more companies with massive fortunes also built on the incredible economics of the web, the Chinese online giants Tencent and Alibaba, also now enjoy market valuations in excess of US$250 billion each. They now rank among the worlds largest companies. Global tech cross-border dealflow is accelerating. October 2016. Paul X McCarthy Since 2000, US technology companies have acquired 230 Asian tech companies with the numbers steadily increasing each year. With even more dramatic growth, Asian tech companies have acquired 373 companies since 2000. Between 2011-2013 Asian tech companies were acquiring between 20 to 30 US companies per year and now it’s double this rate with between 50-60 major deals being consummated each year. Recent noteworthy large-scale deals include: Acquirer Acquired Valuation at acquisition Date Softbank, Japan ARM Holdings, UK US $31.4 Billion July 2016 Tencent, China Supercell, Finland US $10.2 Billion June 2016 Tencent, China Riot Games, US US $400 Million February 2011 Rakuten, Japan Ebates, US US $1 Billion September 2014 Rakuten, Japan Viber, Cyprus US $900 Million February 2014 Acquisitions — one of the keys to tech innovation Mergers and acquisitions are a key but often overlooked part of the digital economy and central to the success of the global technology innovation ecosystem as we know it. Most of Alphabet’s significant innovation since it created the world’s most famous search engine has been the result of its 190 acquisitions. Google Maps, for example, was an acquisition, so too Google Docs, Gmail, and YouTube. Many elements at the core of Google’s breathtaking commercial success in online advertising rely on innovation from startups that were acquired and integrated into Google’s own internal efforts. The impact of the web on accelerating globalisation can be seen beyond the tech sector too. Many digitally transformed traditional industries like media, telecommunications and electronics have also become the subject of major Asia-based cross-border acquisitions including: Industry Acquirer Acquired Valuation at acquisition Date Publishing Nikkei, Japan Financial Times, UK US$1.32 billion 2015 Electronics Toshiba, Japan Landis+Gyr, Switzerland US$2.3 Billion 2011 Telecommunications Singtel, Singapore Optus, Australia US$8.5 billion 2001 Not first time there’s been a surge in cross-border deals In the early 1990s Japanese consumer electronics giants were on the hunt for Hollywood movie studios. They wanted media, software or “content” as it has become known to complement their hardware. Japanese companies invested more than US$13 billion (nearly US$25 billion adjusted to today’s money) in the US film and television industry, which included the mega acquisitions of two of the six largest Hollywood film studios — Matsushita’s acquisition of MCA and Sony’s purchase of Columbia Pictures. Even Walt Disney turned to Japan for US$600 million in financing for its films. It remains to be seen whether we may see a repeat of this scale of deal making with any of today’s US online giants given their unprecedented scale. What’s almost certain is we will see more frequent and larger scale cross-border acquisitions of companies up to the size of Twitter (around US$30 billion) and perhaps even at the scale of Paypal or eBay (US$50 billion+). At a smaller scale again, expect to see many more yo-yo deals with companies criss-crossing the planet to acquire others in their efforts to dominate a vertical market or technology sub-sector. Examples of these style deals include: LeEco (Beijing)‘s $10m acquisition of Sydney based Octopus TV (London) in January* Carsales (Melbourne) estimated $15m purchase of Chileautos (Santiago) in March and Naspers (Cape Town) $180m takeover of Citruspay (Mumbai) last month.

SUBSCRIBE Give Google a break: Tackling paid links is harder than you may think Google is often criticized for how it handles spammy links, but columnist Ian Bowden believes this criticism may be unfair. Here, he takes a look at the challenges Google might face in tackling the ongoing issue of paid links. Ian Bowden on October 5, 2016 at 10:58 am More Prior to the recent arrival of Penguin 4.0, it had been nearly two years since Penguin was last updated. It was expected to roll out at the end of 2015, which then became early 2016. By the summer, some in the industry had given up on Google ever releasing Penguin 4.0. But why did it take so long? I’d argue that criticism directed at Google is in many cases unjustified, as people often take too simplistic a view of the task at hand for the search engine. Detecting and dealing with paid links is a lot harder than many people think, and there are likely good reasons why Google took longer than hoped to release the next iteration of Penguin. Here are some of the challenges Google may have faced in pushing out the most recent Penguin update: 1. It has to be effective at detecting paid links To run and deploy an effective Penguin update, Google has to have the ability to (algorithmically and at scale) determine which links violate guidelines. It’s not clear the extent to which Google is capable of this; there are plenty of case studies which show that links violating the guidelines continue to work. However, not all paid links are created equal. Some paid links are obviously paid for. For instance, they may have certain types of markup around them, or they may be featured within an article clearly denoted as an advertorial. On the other hand, some links may have no telltale signs on the page that they are paid for, so determining whether or not they are paid links comes through observing patterns. The reality is that advanced paid linking strategies will be challenging for Google to either devalue or penalize. Penguin has historically targeted very low-quality web spam, as it is easier to distinguish and qualify, but a level above this is an opportunity. Google has to have confidence in its capability before applying a filter, due to the severity of the outcome. 2. Google is still dependent on links for the best quality search results Maybe, just maybe, Google is actually capable of detecting paid links but chooses not to devalue all of them. Most people will be familiar with third-party tools that perform link analyses to assess which links are “toxic” and will potentially be harming search performance. Users know that sometimes these tools get it wrong, but generally they’re pretty good. I think it is fair to assume that Google has a lot more resources available to do this, so in theory they should be better than third-party tools at detecting paid links. Google has experimented with removing links from their index with negative consequences for the quality of search results. It would be interesting to see the quality of search results when they vary the spammy link threshold of Penguin. It’s possible that even though certain links are not compliant with webmaster guidelines, they still assist Google in their number one goal of returning users the best quality search results. For the time being, they might still be of use to Google. 3. Negative SEO remains a reality If Google is sure that a link has been orchestrated, it is very difficult for the search engine to also be sure whether it was done by the webmaster or by someone else executing a negative SEO campaign. If a penalty or visibility drop were as easy to incur from a handful of paid links, then in theory, it would be pretty straightforward to perform negative SEO on competitors. The barriers to doing this are quite low, and furthermore, the footprint is minimal. Google has tried to negate this problem with the introduction of the disavow tool, but it is not realistic to think all webmasters will know of this, let alone use the tool correctly. This is a challenge for Google in tackling paid links. 4. It provides a PR backlash and unwanted attention When rolling out large algorithm updates, it’s inevitable that there will be false positives or severe punishments for small offenses. After any rollout, there will be a number of “adjustments” as Google measures the impact of the update and attempts to tweak it. Despite that, a large number of businesses will suffer as a result of these updates. Those who regularly join Google Webmaster Hangouts will be used to business owners, almost in tears, discussing the devastating impact of a recent update and pleading for more information. While the vast majority of Google users will most likely never be aware of or care about the fallout of algorithm updates, these situations do provide Google with some degree of negative PR. Any noise that points toward Google yielding too much power is unwanted attention. On a related note, sometimes penalties are just not viable for Google. When someone walks down Main Street, they expect to see certain retailers. It’s exactly the same with search results. Users going to Google expect to see the top brands. The user doesn’t really care if a brand is not appearing because of a penalty. Users will hold it as a reflection on the quality of Google rather than the brand’s non-compliance with guidelines. To be clear, that’s not to say that Google never penalizes big brands — JCPenney, Sprint, the BBC and plenty of other large brands have all received high-profile manual penalties in the past. But Google does have to consider the impact on the user experience when choosing how to weight different types of links. If users don’t see the websites they expect in search results, the result could be switching to another search engine. This is how Google deals with the problem The above four points highlight some of the challenges Google faces. Fewer things are more important than meeting its objective of returning the most useful results to its users, so it has a massive interest in dealing with paid links. Here are some ways Google could address the challenges it faces: 1. Prefer to devalue links and issue fewer penalties Penalties act as a deterrent for violating guidelines, and they serve to improve the quality of search results by demoting results that were artificially boosted. A lot of the risk of “getting it wrong” can simply be mitigated through devaluing links algorithmically, rather than imposing manual penalties. In the instance of a negative SEO attack, the spammy links, instead of causing a penalty for a website, could simply not be counted. In theory, this is the purpose of a disavow file. Penalties could be saved for only the most egregious offenders. The fact that Penguin now runs in real time as part of the core ranking algorithm suggests that this is the direction they are heading in: favoring the devaluation of spammy links through “algorithmic” penalties (which websites can now recover from more quickly), and manual penalties only being applied for serious offenses. 2. Do a slow rollout combined with other updates Slowly rolling out the Penguin 4.0 update provides Google two advantages. First, it softens the blow of the update. There is not one week when suddenly some large profile brands drop visibility, drawing attention to the update. Second, it allows Google to test the impact of the update and adjust over time. If the update is too harsh, they can adjust the parameters. Penguin 4.0 may take several weeks to roll out. To add to the confusion and make it more difficult to understand the impact of Penguin 4.0, it is probable Google will roll out some other updates at the same time. If you cast your memory back two years to the introduction of Panda 4.1 and Penguin 3.0, they were rolled out almost in conjunction. This made it more difficult to understand what their impacts were. There was a lot of SERP fluctuation this September. It is possible part of this fluctuation can be attributed to Penguin 4.0 testing, but there is no certainty because of the amount of other updates occurring (such as the local update dubbed “Possum“). 3. Encourage a culture of fear Even if the risk of receiving a penalty is the same now as it was five years ago, the anxiety and fear of receiving one is much greater among brands. High-profile penalties have not only served their function of punishing the offending brand, but they also have provided a great deterrent to anyone else considering such a strategy. The transition to content marketing and SEO becoming less of a black box assisted in this, but this culture of fear has been a large driver in the reduction of paid link activity. Final thoughts Google is often criticized for not doing more to tackle paid links, but I think that criticism is unfair. When one considers the challenges search engines face when tackling paid links, one can be more forgiving. Now that Google has incorporated Penguin into the core algorithm, webmasters may have an easier time recovering from ranking issues that arise from spammy or paid links, as they will not have to wait until “the next update” (sometimes years) to recover from an algorithmic devaluation. However, the fact that Penguin now operates in real time will make it more difficult for webmasters to know when a loss in rankings is due to spammy links or something else — so webmasters will need to be vigilant about monitoring the health of their backlink profiles. I suspect that Google will continue to make tweaks and adjustments to Penguin after the rollout is complete, and I expect to see a continued shift from penalties to devaluing links over time.

SUBSCRIBE How to check which URLs have been indexed by Google using Python Google Search Console can help you determine which of your website pages are indexed, but what about identifying the ones that aren't? Columnist Paul Shapiro has a Python script that does just that. Paul Shapiro on October 5, 2016 at 1:26 pm More There are three main components to organic search: crawling, indexing and ranking. When a search engine like Google arrives at your website, it crawls all of the links it finds. Information about what it finds is then entered into the search engine’s index, where different factors are used to determine which pages to fetch, and in what order, for a particular search query. As SEOs, we tend to focus our efforts on the ranking component, but if a search engine isn’t able to crawl and index the pages on your site, you’re not going to receive any traffic from Google. Clearly, ensuring your site is properly crawled and indexed by search engines is an important part of SEO. But how can you tell if your site is indexed properly? If you have access to Google Search Console, it tells you how many pages are contained in your XML sitemap and how many of them are indexed. Unfortunately, it doesn’t go as far as to tell you which pages aren’t indexed. This can leave you with a lot of guesswork or manual checking. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. No good! Let’s solve this problem with a little technical ingenuity and another free SEO tool of mine. Determining if a single URL has been indexed by Google To determine if an individual URL has been indexed by Google, we can use the “info:” search operator, like so: info:http://searchengineland.com/google-downplays-google-algorithm-ranking-update-week-normal-fluctuations-258923 If the URL is indexed, a result will show for that URL: However, if the URL is not indexed, Google will return an error saying there is no information available for that URL: Using Python to bulk-check index status of URLs Now that we know how to check if a single URL has been indexed, you might be wondering how you can do this en masse. You could have 1,000 little workers check each one — or, if you prefer, you could use my Python solution: To use the Python script above, make sure you have Python 3 installed. You will also have to install the BeautifulSoup library. To do this, open up a terminal or command prompt and execute: pip install beautifulsoup4 You can then download the script to your computer. In the same folder as the script, create a text file with a list of URLs, listing each URL on a separate line. Now that your script is ready, we need to set up Tor to run as our free proxy. On Windows, download the Tor Expert Bundle. Extract the zip folder to a local directory and run tor.exe. Feel free to minimize the window. Next, we have to install Polipo to run Tor and HTTP proxy. Download the latest Windows binary (it will be named “polipo-1.x.x.x-win32.zip”) and unzip to a folder. In your Polipo folder, create a text file (ex: config.txt) with the following contents: socksParentProxy = "localhost:9050" socksProxyType = socks5 diskCacheRoot = "" disableLocalInterface=true Open a command prompt and navigate to your Polipo directory. Run the following command: polipo.exe -c config.txt At this point, we’re ready to run our actual Python script: python indexchecker.py The script will prompt you to specify the number of seconds to wait between checking each URL. It will also prompt you to enter a filename (without the file extension) to output the results to a CSV. Finally, it will ask for the filename of the text file that contains the list of URLs to check. Enter this information and let the script run. The end result will be a CSV file, which can easily be opened in Excel, specifying TRUE if a page is indexed or FALSE if it isn’t. In the event that the script seems to not be working, Google has probably blocked Tor. Feel free to use your own proxy service in this case, by modifying the following lines of the script: proxies = { 'https' : 'https://localhost:8123', 'https' : 'http://localhost:8123' } Conclusion Knowing which pages are indexed by Google is critical to SEO success. You can’t get traffic from Google if your web pages aren’t in Google’s database! Unfortunately, Google doesn’t make it easy to determine which URLs on a website are indexed. But with a little elbow grease and the above Python script, we are able to solve this problem.

Carter established the board in March, inviting as members 15 innovators from the private sector and academia to enhance the department’s culture, organization and processes. The DIB chairman is Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

DoD photo by Air Force Tech. Sgt. Brigitte N. Brantley Download Image Image details page The independent advisory board operates under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Government in Sunshine Act. Its next public meeting is scheduled in January. The board members are LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, University of Texas Chancellor and former Special Operations Command Commander Navy Adm. William McRaven, Aspen Institute President and Chief Executive Walter Isaacson, Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey Bezos, and Code for America's Founder and Executive Director Jennifer Pahlka. The board also includes Google Capital's Vice President for Access Services Milo Medin, Instagram Chief Operating Officer Marne Levine, United Technologies Senior Vice President for Science and Technology J. Michael McQuade, Wharton School of Business Professor Dr. Adam Grant, California Institute of Technology Dynamical Systems Professor and Bioengineer Richard Murray, Harvard’s Robert Walmsley University Professor Cass Sunstein, computer theorist and co-founder of Applied Invention Danny Hillis, Broad Institute President and Founding Director Eric Lander and Hayden Planetarium Director Neil deGrasse Tyson. First DIB Meeting “One of my core goals as secretary of defense has been to push the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box, and be more open to new ideas and new partnerships that can help our military remain what it is today … as we confront a changing and fiercely competitive world,” Carter said. “That’s exactly why I created the Defense Innovation Board earlier this year -- to advise me and future defense secretaries on how we can keep growing more competitive, stay ahead of our competitors [and] stay the best,” he added, “particularly by keeping DoD imbued with a culture of innovation in people, practices, organizations and technology.” Board members already have spent time with airmen at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, sailors aboard ships docked in San Diego, soldiers and special operators at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, at U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida, U.S. Cyber Command and other DoD installations, Carter and Schmidt told attendees. “As a result of this initial fact-finding,” Carter said, “and based on the knowledge and experience each of you brings to the table from your private-sector lives in industry and in the academy -- members of the board have made some preliminary observations and interim recommendations about certain innovative practices from outside DoD that might be useful to us.” Interim Recommendations Interim recommendations included the following: -- Appoint a DoD chief innovation officer to coordinate, oversee and synchronize innovation activities across the department. -- Establish a career track for computer science and a digital Reserve Officer’s Training Corps program. -- Build a culture of evidence-based, outcome-driven policies and experimentation by, among other things, offering bonuses, recognition, awards and other incentives for managers who promote innovation, give employees greater voice  and encourage creativity and divergent views. -- Direct Cybercom, working in coordination with the National Security Agency, to conduct a security review of every DoD system. -- Establish an institute for studying artificial intelligence and machine learning. -- Increase the speed and timeliness of acquisition processes by increasing the use of mechanisms for waivers and exemptions and offering incentives for quickly resolving concerns. -- Increase investment in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Strategic Capabilities Office, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, rapid equipping units and other small, agile, innovative organizations and create more connections among them. -- Establish a computer science resource --·a "human cloud" of computer programmers and software developers who are available on demand to swiftly solve software problems. Citizen-Leader-Innovators As a result of their initial fact-finding trips and based on their knowledge and experience, board members today discussed preliminary observations and their interim recommendations about innovative practices from outside DoD that might be useful to the Pentagon, Carter said. “And I'm pleased that rather than going off and returning with your several-hundred-page report,” he added, “you're here today to share these early findings with me and the public directly, and to solicit feedback as you begin the next phase of your work. In his remarks, Schmidt said that the board was in its “user research phase.” “We've been on submarines and watch floors and op centers and laboratories and flightlines,” he added, “because it's interesting to the members, and because there’s nothing like understanding what people do and how they do it when making recommendations for change.” Over the next months, the board will visit more military facilities and develop a valid set of recommendations, then over 2017 will monitor actions taken across the department on the recommendations. “I couldn't have asked for a group better qualified for this mission,” Carter said during his remarks. “I'm grateful to these citizen-leader-innovators for taking the time from their busy schedules to do this. I don't take it for granted for your selfless willingness to contribute to the defense of our nation, and make a better world for our children,” the secretary said.

Google said it was working with Kolkata Police to identify and put the "top pandals" of the city on Google Maps with customised icons and the service will go live by October 6 evening. "The initiative will help the people of Kolkata get to their chosen destination quickly and seamlessly during the Durga Puja days. Google will also offer the updated road restrictions and one-ways information on Google Maps as shared directly by the traffic police, enabling people to get to their destinations quickly and conveniently by identifying alternative routes," a Google release said today. One can search for a Durga pandal by name and get routed there. One can also select the icons to know more about the pandal. "Our goal is to continue making Google Maps a handy commute companion for everyone. If you are hopping from one pandal in south Kolkata to another in north, Google Maps will alert you about the traffic condition and help you save time. Moreover, since traffic rules change during the day and night, Google Maps will give you the latest updated information," Google Product Manager Sanket Gupta said. There is a few apps such as 'Utsavapp' on Durga Puja to make pandal-hopping easy. BSM CR RCStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

They mostly mimic similar devices from Apple, Facebook and Amazon. The machine learning powering them however, should lead to plenty of market opportunities for Google and its parent company, Alphabet.

(NASDAQ: AAPL)'s iPhone. But, can it win against the all-powerful iPhone? Related Link: Google's Pixel Phone: Everything You Wanted The iPhone To Be Colin Gillis, BGC's financial director of research and senior technology analyst, was a guest on CNBC's "Squawk On The Street" segment to offer his take. He suggested that Apple has its "loyal" fanbase, and this won't change with Google's entrance to the high-end smartphone market. In fact, Google and Android dominate the global smartphone market with an 86 percent market share. The other 14 percent represents the high-end smartphone market and an area where Google and Android have less of a share. Gillis added that Google isn't a threat to Apple right now, but it could be in a few years. Ken Allen, T. Rowe Price's technology fund manager offered his take. He suggested that the specs on Google's phone are within the same "ballpark" as those of the iPhone, but Google holds a major advantage since it is a software company at its core. Allen continued that Alphabet could win the battle given its massive computing capabilities, its massive reach with Search and its other apps. Gillis agreed with Allen and added that Google's expertise in artificial intelligence isn't necessarily reflected in Alphabet's current stock price. He also added that Google's integration of its artificial intelligence software into hardware will be a "major driver" over the next five years. What The Crowd Thinks Who is Vetr's top pick among Alphabet and Apple? Among the Vetr crowd, 48.6 percent of members rate Alphabet with a Buy rating, 25.7 percent rate the stock a Hold and the remaining 25.7 percent hold a bearish view. The crowd-sourced price target of $845.32 implies an upside just shy of 8.5 percent. Related Link: Google Seeking The Trifecta Of Hardware, Software And A.I. By comparison, 39.1 percent of the Vetr crowd rate Apple with a Buy rating, 14 percent with a Hold rating and the remaining 46.9 percent rate Apple a Sell. The crowd sourced price target of $115.46 implies an upside of barely 2 percent. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

For the first time, Android has its very own flagship in the form of the 5-inch Google Pixel and 5.5-inch Google Pixel XL. Technically, both phones are made by HTC, but Google has involved itself more in these two devices than any previous Nexus, including the 6P and 5X. You won't even find any HTC branding on either Pixel; they're Google through and through. Naturally, we have to see how the Pixel measures up with the Samsung Galaxy S7—widely considered to be the best Android phone available, especially since its Edge variant is our Editors' Choice winner for best Android phone.

But unlike the iPhone, the Pixel sports a fingerprint scanner on the back, set in the middle of a half-pane of glass. You'll also find a USB-C charging port on the bottom and a 3.5mm audio jack up top. The power button and volume rocker are on the right. The Galaxy S7 is also a glass-and-metal phone, following Samsung's premium design language. You have metal sides, a glass back, and a combined fingerprint scanner/home button on the front with a set of capacitive buttons on either side. Unlike the Pixel, the S7 also uses microUSB rather than USB-C. Ultimately, aesthetics are always going to be a matter of opinion, but it's hard to argue that the S7 isn't more symmetrical and put together in terms of its overall look. The Really Blue Pixel does look nice, though. Despite the distinct design differences, both phones are roughly the same size. The Google Pixel measures 5.7 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5 ounces; the S7 (5.6 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches) is a tiny bit heavier at 5.4 ounces. allowfullscreen</g>?wmode=transparent"> Both phones should be fairly easy to use one-handed, but you're likely to notice one big difference when looking at them. The 5-inch Pixel only has a 1,920-by-1,080 AMOLED display, which won't be as sharp or rich as the S7's 5.1-inch, 2,560-by-1,440 Super AMOLED panel. Their respective resolutions work out to 441 pixels per inch for the Pixel and a much denser 577ppi for the S7. Samsung is widely considered to have some of the best displays in the market, and it seems in this category the Pixel can't compete. That said, 1080p should still be more than enough on a 5-inch phone. Between the two phones, the major things the Pixel lacks are waterproofing, wireless charging, and a microSD card slot. By contrast, the S7 is IP68 waterproof, letting it survive for 30 minutes under six feet of water. It also supports wireless charging and can take a microSD card up to 256GB, albeit with Marshmallow's adoptable storage feature disabled. Processor and Battery The Pixel is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor with 4GB of RAM, and comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. The S7 is powered by the Snapdragon 820 and has 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. When it comes to performance, the S7 was blazing fast in our tests, scoring an impressive 123.993 on AnTuTu, which measures overall system performance. We'll need to put the Pixel through its paces here at PC Labs, but due to its improved processor, less demanding display, and lightweight UI, we can reasonably expect the Pixel to perform better in benchmarks. In terms of real-world usage, though, both phones are fast and powerful. Battery life is another factor that's hard to determine without testing. The S7 has a 3000mAh cell under the hood, which lasted nine hours during our rundown test, where we set screen brightness to maximum and stream full-screen video over LTE. The Pixel has a somewhat smaller 2,770mAh battery, but compensates with a lower-resolution display, so we're expecting a fairly good runtime. Both phones support fast charging. Camera The Samsung Galaxy S7 has the best camera of any smartphone on the market, including the iPhone 7. With a 12-megapixel rear-facing sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS), a fast-launching camera app, 4K video recording, and 5-megapixel front-facing camera, the S7 is known for taking crisp shots in most lighting conditions. The Pixel has the potential to give it a run for its money, though. It comes with a fully redesigned camera, boasting a 12.3-megapixel rear sensor with laser autofocus and dual-LED flash, an 8-megapixel front sensor, and support for 4K video recording. Notably, it topped DxOmark's ranking, scoring 89, which is a tad higher than the S7 Edge's 88 (the S7 and S7 Edge share the same camera hardware). During its launch event, Google emphasized that it spent lots of time and effort in perfecting the camera so the Pixel can take great shots in low light and other less-than-ideal settings. Despite the lack of OIS, it should also be capable of taking incredibly well-stabilized video by using its gyroscope. We're still not clear on all the details, but we'll definitely be doing a shootout between the Pixel and the S7 once we get our hands on it. Software, Support, and Peripherals Software is going to be one of the biggest differentiators between the Pixel and the S7. The Pixel runs a version of Android 7.0 Nougat, as Google intended, while the S7 is still on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with plans to get the update at some point soon. That means the Pixel provides the purest Android experience—free from bloatware, heavy UI layers, carrier pre-installs, and the sluggish updates that characterize most other Android phones, including the S7. There's no doubt that Samsung's TouchWiz UI packs in lots of useful features, like split-screen, the always-on screen for notifications, but it also bogs down the device. The Pixel is free of that, consisting of Google's suite of apps, including Duo, the newly launched video chat app. Even the Verizon-exclusive phones shouldn't have any bloatware. Aside from aesthetics like round icons, Google is bringing useful features to Nougat, like Google Assistant, which takes Google Now to the next level by giving you a complete voice assistant powered by machine learning. The one, huge selling point of the Pixel is the fact that it comes with 24/7 live customer support for the phone. There's even a screen-share option to allow the agent to see your phone's screen. The Pixel will also be first Android phone to get every new update. Google is leaps and bounds ahead of Samsung in this category so that's an experience you just won't get on the S7. Both phones have dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC with Android Pay, and LTE band support for every major US carrier. Samsung used to be the only major manufacturer to have a custom-built VR headset for use with its phone, the Gear VR. Now Google is in on it with Daydream, a software platform to support the Daydream View headset (above). The Pixel is the first fully Daydream VR-enabled phone, but the $79 Daydream View will also work with other compatible devices. Price, Availability, and Conclusions The Google Pixel comes in three colors—Very Silver, Quite Black, and the limited-edition Really Blue—at a starting price of $649 for its 32GB model. The 128GB model is $100 more, at $749. It is available for pre-order through the Google Store, Verizon, and Best Buy. //Related Articles Hands On: Google's Pixel Smartphone These prices are in line with most other top-tier phones, including the Galaxy S7. On T-Mobile and most other carriers, the phone is available for $689.99 for its 32GB model (the only capacity you can get in the US). That's actually more expensive than the base price of the Pixel. Overall, while it's true that the Pixel is more expensive than last year's Nexus 5X, that's because it's intended to be. The Pixel is a phone that looks capable of going toe-to-toe with the S7 and iPhone 7. It comes with a newer processor, reliable updates, 24/7 support, Google Assistant, and what sounds like a seriously capable camera. If software is important to you, the Google Pixel is shaping up to be a great option for Android users. On the other hand, if you love beautiful screens and a rich array of features, the Galaxy S7 remains an excellent phone. Either way, we'll be getting the Pixel in here at PC Lab and putting it to the test, so check back for our full review. Back to top Previous : Love (or Hate?) Your Note 7?

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Google Pixel may dent iPhone 7 hype Alnoor Peermohamed | Bengaluru Oct 05, 2016 11:53 PM IST India is among the six countries in the world where Google will launch its Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. With pre-orders starting on October 13, it could dissipate some of the hype around the Apple iPhone 7’s launch this Friday. Google’s Pixel range of phones have been designed entirely in-house and the prices, starting at Rs 57,000, are also similar to that of iPhone 7. The devices will go on sale by the end of October across Flipkart, Croma, Reliance Digital and Vijay Sales. Armed with Google’s artificial intelligence-powered assistant and top-notch hardware to boot, the Pixel and Pixel XL mark Google’s entry into the truly high-end smartphone market. While the previous Nexus devices were often compared to the iPhone, the search giant along with its partners sought that those devices were accessible to a larger number of buyers. “If you look at it from Google’s perspective, they’re trying to position Pixel as the most premium Android experience you can get. If the company can market it well in the next two-three weeks, they could attract mature Android buyers in the market for a new device and with the Samsung Note 7 debacle, I’d say Google is well placed,” said Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research. But, a big sticker price could mean low sales for the Pixel phones. Even Apple controls only three per cent of the smartphone market. Moreover, Apple heavily relies on older models of its iPhone, such as the 5s which sell for under Rs 20,000, to drive nearly half of its sales in the country. While Google has its work cut out cannibalising Samsung’s share in the premium smartphone market, experts say going after Apple will be a Herculean task. Samsung, a long-time partner of Google, is the only player that is giving Apple a tough fight in India’s premium device market, with HTC, Sony and LG being relegated to the sidelines. “The big question is if Google Pixel can position itself as the most advanced smartphone. That’s something we’re going to have to wait and see,” added Shah. Apple’s focus on growing its business in India suggests that the country is on the way to becoming one of the largest markets for premium smartphones. If Google wants to beat the iPhone with its Pixel phones, it is going to have to replicate or break the aspirational value which Apple has so successfully created for its devices. In terms of picking partners for India, Google is clearly showing global rivals Amazon and Apple that it is taking sides. The new Pixel smartphones will be sold exclusively on Flipkart. Google has also tapped one of Apple’s largest India partners — Reliance — which runs a large number of exclusive Apple stores in the country. “Both Google Pixel and the iPhone could be technologically pari passu products of equal importance, of equal value, of equal affinity, but in image terms the two are like chalk and cheese. Apple is the platinum standard of the industry whereas Google is a ration shop for information. So, Google needs to invest a lot more than depend on the laurels of being the most accepted, the most daily used and the most intrusively used brand in India,” said Harish Bijoor, a brand consultant. Being a services company before becoming a device maker, Google knows a thing or two about a wholesome experience, and isn’t leaving it solely up to its new Pixel phones to woo buyers. The firm, which will offer 24x7 device support for its new smartphones, has also extended the service to India, setting up a dedicated call centre for its buyers here.

Taiwan asks Google to blur images of South China Sea island Google cuts its giant electricity bill with AI How to make an honest robot? Google takes on the challenge The string of announcements -- including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the living room dubbed “Home,” a virtual reality headset, and a new Wi-Fi router -- is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head to head with Apple, Amazon.com, Inc. and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Unlike earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan’s HTC Corp. will serve as the contract manufacturer. SWIPE AT APPLE Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States, Verizon Communications, Inc., on the Pixel, emulating Apple’s agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T, Inc. That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders began on Oct. 4. “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones,” industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. While the new phones are clearly aimed at competing with the iPhone -- Google executives took several swipes at Apple in their on-stage remarks -- analysts said Android rivals like Samsung Electronics could be the biggest victim if the Pixel takes off. Google’s strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89% of the global market, according to IDC. But Apple still rules the high end of the market, and Google has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. ALL-PURPOSE ASSISTANT Google kicked off the event Tuesday by touting the Google Assistant, the company’s voice-activated artificial intelligence system and its answer to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. The presenter showed how customers could make a restaurant reservation with a few phrases spoken into the phone. The assistant will be embedded into the Pixel and Home products and is being positioned as the central feature in a family of integrated hardware and software products. It is one of a handful of similar assistants that are vying for supremacy as more people search the Web and make purchases online using voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling digital devices. While Google is often cited as the leader in artificial intelligence, Amazon stole a march on the company with its Alexa-powered Echo home speaker system, a surprise hit. The Home device and the Echo have many of the same features. Google’s “Daydream View” virtual reality headset, meanwhile, puts the company in competition with Facebook, Inc., owner of Oculus. The device, which works with an Android phone, is far cheaper and simpler. It will be available in November for $79, in time for the end-of-year shopping season. Home will also be available in November for $129, including a six-month trial of ad-free YouTube. -- Reuters    MORE STORIES Snapchat parent secretly files for one of the biggest tech IPOs Review: "Moto Z: Best modular phone?"

(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone. Therefore, tough competition between the two big firms is in the cards. Baird Equity Research pointed out that the new Pixel phone would have a complete Google Assistant and Daydream VR, possibly giving it a competitive edge against the iPhone 7. Pixel comes with advanced processor of QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM)'s Snapdragon and provides rapid charging capabilities. DxOMark, a camera analyst and ratings provider, gave the highest rating to Pixel's camera. Analysts Colin Sebastian and Benjamin Gaither think the latest move is based on the success enjoyed by Nexus and the Android OS. They also believe the search engine flexed its ML/AI capabilities to fit into the scheme of Pixel very well. Related Link: Google Seeking The Trifecta Of Hardware, Software And A.I. The brokerage elaborated, "Google Assistant leverages long-term focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Google's virtual assistant continues to evolve from underlying core search and knowledge graph (70 billion facts), recently extended to Allo messaging app, and now to new Pixel phones and Home smart devices." Baird thinks the search engine's capabilities on ML/AI are the key differentiator with its rivals. Although the firm thinks there is restricted impact from the new devices on the top line, the brokerage expects ML/AI apps improvement with the help of generated data from the use. As far as Daydream VR, the analysts think it offers developers tools to distribute content extensively. According to the analysts, the company made the right decision for a dedicated VR and AR platform. The brokerage maintains its Outperform rating and $900 target price. At Last Check ...

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Cast app renamed to ‘Google Home’, removes Chrome branding By R Padla - October 5, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Chromecast may have started the “casting” idea for Google but the company has decided to rename its companion app. From Chromecast, the app is now known as ‘Google Cast’. Some people were confused at first when searching for the Chromecast app on their device but Google did the name change to expand reach. The “casting” idea became popular as made possible by the Chromecast and Chromecast Audio. Other similar devices entered the market but Google made them very affordable and easier to use. From Chromecast to Google Cast and now the app is getting a new name. No official confirmation yet from the tech giant but some mobile users have been sharing the news after seeing the old Google Cast app has become the new ‘Google Home’. We didn’t expect this when we heard about the Google Home device but since streaming and casting are allowed and that it’s basically a bigger Chromecast with voice assistant, the change is inevitable. The ‘Google Home’ app integrates all streaming devices by the company at home. If you have a Chromecast, you will find the Google Home is a combination of the streaming puck and the Google Now on your phone. The newest Chromecast Preview firmware already shows the ‘Google Home’ app and not ‘Google Cast’. The tech giant is still not done with the renaming and rebranding. This one is simply a name change of the app. Google Cast is still available not as an app but more of the technology being used. When you say Google Cast, it’s the idea of sending content or media from a device like computer, phone, or tablet to a bigger display, TV, or speakers.

Reigart on 10.05.2016       Tweet print  rss  Google is pushing to more tightly integrate its digital products with the physical world, a move bolstered by introduction of new hardware. Of particular interest to broadcasters will be the Pixel and Pixel XL. These smartphones claim some impressive specs — long battery life, good storage options, and excellent camera and more. Google also includes the standard 3.5 mm headphone jack for both phones — highlighted in the introductory video (a pointed dig at rival Apple’s decision to remove theirs). In the U.S. Pixel will be carried exclusively by Verizon. However, unlocked phones will be sold online and through Best Buy, enabling consumers who use AT&T, Sprint and other mobile carriers to also get their hands on the goods. However, what is not yet clear is whether or not the phone is FM chip compatible. U.K.-based Radio magazine contributor and RadioDNS Project Director Nick Piggott observed on Twitter that “it’s got the right Qualcomm silicon in it to be FM-compat[ible] ... but did they connect the antenna to the 3.5 mm socket...?” Despite the many tech specs that have already been unveiled, that question remains unanswered, at least for now.   I reached out to press representatives at Google; they could not be reached for comment. If any additional information is forthcoming, I will update this or a subsequent article.   NextRadio representative Maura Kautsky told Radio World in an email that “this is not an issue; just like the Apple phones we can use the USB jack, just as we use the headset port as the antenna to get FM radio.    Receive regular news and technology updates.

The phones were manufactured by longtime Android phone maker HTC and they pack high-end specs that measure up to some of the best the competition has to offer. Take the 5-inch Pixel, for instance. It’s the decidedly more diminutive of the two, but packs a processing punch. It’s crafted from a combination of machined metal and glossy plastic under which sits a 5-inch, Full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) AMOLED screen. Powering the handset’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, and around its front and back are cameras with optical image stabilization and assisted autofocus. It’s running the newest version of Android, 7.1 Nougat. Related: Forget the iPhone 7, next year’s smartphone from Apple will be one big screen The Pixel packs a potent hardware/software combination that compares favorably to Samsung’s Galaxy S7, but admittedly not in all areas. The Seoul, Korea-based company’s former flagship features a waterproof design of melded metal and glass; a 5.1-inch Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) AMOLED screen even today, seven months after its release, qualifies as one of the brightest and most accurate on the market; and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 processor. And that’s not all. It sports an impressive pair of shooters with phase detection autofocus and support for high-dynamic range, biometric sensors like a heart rate and blood oxygen sensor, and hardware support for  Samsung’s proprietary payments platform, Samsung Pay. All that said, sussing out the better buy is a tougher call than you might expect. The Pixel’s price point is attractive, but so is the Galaxy S7’s display and support for Samsung Pay. The Pixel packs the newest version of Android, Nougat 7.1, but the Galaxy S7 packs features beyond those offered by default Android. Which phone wins? The answer might surprise you.

They have the same 4GB of RAM, and they’re comparable in terms of internal storage: there’s a 32GB Pixel and a 32GB Galaxy S7. Both sport USB Type-C connectors. And they share accouterments like a fingerprint scanner, 3.5 mm headphone jack, dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 in common. But not everything’s the same. The processors certainly aren’t. The Galaxy S7 packs Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 820, a powerhouse in its own right. But the Pixel packs a refinement on that silicon: the Snapdragon 821. Although it may not seem like a huge jump, it’s an advancement that’s anything but minor. The new Snapdragon promises a 10 percent improvement in power efficiency over the Snapdragon 820, and it’s capable of speeds up to 2.4GHz. When it comes to number crunching, preliminary benchmarks show that it’s quite the champ: the ZenFone 3 Deluxe, the first phone to ship with the 821 onboard, achieved 1,850 single-core performance in Geekbench. The Galaxy S7, meanwhile, reaches an average single-core and multi-core score of 1,789. Samsung Galaxy S7More Read More Samsung Galaxy S7 Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends It’s worth noting that the ZenFone 3 Deluxe has the advantage of 6GB of RAM, of course. Given the 821’s theoretical advantage, though, the results are in line with what we expect. What’s that mean in real-world terms? It’s difficult to predict, but in theory, apps should launch slightly faster, graphics-heavy websites should open more quickly, and lengthy documents (particularly spreadsheets) should load noticeably faster. Related: Hands on: Google Pixel and Pixel XL The advantage isn’t as clear when it comes to internal storage. The Pixel ships in two configurations, 32GB and 128GB, and while the Galaxy S7 doesn’t offer quite as much — it maxes out at 64GB — it offers consolation in the form of a Micro SD card slot. If you’ve got spare storage lying around or the money to buy some, the Galaxy S7 is the clear winner of that category. The overall winner depends on your priorities. The Pixel has a slight processing advantage, true, but arguably falls short in the area of storage — it lacks the flexibility afforded by a Micro SD card slot. The Galaxy S7 misses on raw power, but provides a comparative abundance of storage options. If storage — and the possibility of expanding it down the line — is of the utmost importance to you, the Galaxy S7 is your trophy bearer. But if a (slightly) more powerful processor means the world, then the Pixel deserves your consideration. Winner: Tie Design Design is inherently subjective — especially when it comes to something as personal as a smartphone. Some folks prefer glass. Others prefer aluminum. And still others would rather plastic. But not every specification is quite so binary. The Galaxy S7, for its part, is a stunner of a smartphone. It’s a celebration of metal and aluminum: the front and back’s made of reinforced Gorilla Glass and the middle’s a bezel of machined metal. It’s a bit more prone to fingerprints than, say, textured plastic, and in all likelihood prone to shattering if dropped particularly carelessly. But the gorgeous design makes those minor inconveniences largely worth putting up over. The Pixel may lack the Galaxy S7’s dominating front and back glass panels, but it’s no shortage of aluminum and glass. The top half is covered in transparent shielding; the bottom half sports a metallic finish; and the back is made of a glossy material. It’s been described as a “cross between the Nexus 4 and [the] iPhone,” and that’s largely accurate: the Pixel is angular, relatively thin, and features a measurable amount of plastic similar to what is utilized in HTC’s Desire line of phones. Google PixelMore Google Pixel Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Somewhat controversially, though, the Pixel’s screen bezels — especially the top and bottom — are quite a bit larger than those on some of its competition. That could be perceived as selling point — they provide a place to rest hands and fingers when using the Pixel in the landscape orientation — but a perhaps, too, a blight on an otherwise attractive design. Related: Samsung Galaxy S7 review Whether the Pixel bests the Galaxy S7 in terms of aesthetics is a matter best sussed out individually. Based on our time so far with the Pixel, though, we think it’s a gorgeous design that stands out in a crowded field of smartphone competitors. Winner: Pixel Battery There’s a clear winner in terms of battery, and it’s not the Pixel. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 boasts a Lithium-ion power pack that’s ever-so-slightly larger in capacity than the Pixel’s supply: 3,000Ah versus 2,770mAh module. How much of a difference that 230mAh advantage will make in day-to-day use is difficult to say, of course, especially given the Snapdragon 821’s improved power efficiency. But it’s not too far a logical leap to assume that the Galaxy S7 will notch a win in the longevity department. Charging is a different story. Both the Pixel and Galaxy S7 support Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 standard, which promises, in theory, charging to 80 percent of capacity in just 35 minutes. But the Galaxy S7 has an added advantage: wireless charging. That’s enough to cement a win over the Pixel, even though it’s not a vital feature. Winner: Galaxy S7 Display The Pixel and Galaxy S7 may share the same display type in AMOLED — a colorful, saturated technology that generally exhibits impressive black levels — but the Galaxy S7’s screen has a far higher resolution than of the Pixel: it’s Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels), or double the resolution of the Pixel’s Full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels). That confers an advantage in the area of pixel density. The Galaxy S7’s panel sports 551 pixels per inch versus the Pixel’s 441, which in real-world terms should mean sharper text, clearer images, and slightly more perceptible detail in high-resolution movies and video clips. Samsung Galaxy S7More Samsung Galaxy S7 Jeffrey Van Camp/Digital Trends When it comes to display size, though, the winner is less clear. The Galaxy S7 packs a 5.1-inch panel, while the Pixel packs a 5-inch model — for all intents and purposes, roughly equal. The Galaxy S7’s superior resolution nets it the overall win in the display category. We’ll have to dive deeper to determine which of the two handsets offer better color reproduction, brightness, and viewing angles, but until we get our hands on a Pixel review unit, Samsung walks away the winner of this battle. Winner: Galaxy S7 Camera Both the Galaxy S7 and Pixel take have outstanding camera chops, but one may have a slight edge. The Galaxy S7 sports a 12-megapixel sensor with a f/1.7 aperture, phase detection autofocus, and optical image stabilization. It’s a great all-around performer: in the course of our testing, we were impressed with its ability to capture sharp images in the dark and illuminate areas many phones at its price point couldn’t. That said, the Galaxy S7’s shots are infamously oversaturated — if you’re hoping for natural color reproduction, it’ll probably disappoint. The Galaxy S7’s front-facing shooter, meanwhile, is more than serviceable for the occasional selfie. It’s a 5-megapixel model with an f/1.7 aperture, and an excellent performer in nighttime and otherwise dim surroundings. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — Oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event The Pixel’s cameras are the technically superior of the two handsets. Google’s flagship packs a rear-facing camera roughly the same megapixel count as the Galaxy S7, or 12.3-megapixel, with a higher aperture — f/2.0. The quality impressed analysts at research firm DxOMark: they bestowed the Pixel the highest rating they’ve ever awarded a smartphone. Google PixelMore Google Pixel Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Software’s partially to thank for the Pixel’s performance. Smart Burst takes multiple snaps in milliseconds and automatically chooses the best. HDR Plus takes “clear, vivid pictures” in “challenging conditions.” The video stabilization may be best in class: thanks to a custom algorithm that samples gyroscope data 200 times a second and compensates for rolling shutter, videos turn out as smooth as butter. The Pixel may eek out a win in the front-facing camera category, too. It sports an 8-megapixel shooter — a sensor far higher in resolution than the Galaxy S7’s 5-megapixel model. All that said, it’s tough to tell definitely which would win in a shootout. On paper, the Pixel has the clear advantage, but myriad factors could influence those results. Short of a unit with which to shoot, though, we’ve got to rely on second-hand tests and hypothetical metrics. And given the evidence at hand, the Pixel’s the winner in the camera department. Winner: Pixel Durability Whether the Galaxy S7 withstands drops and scratches better than the Pixel remains to be seen, but it’s objectively better at handling water. That’s judging by its IP68 rating, which indicates that it’s dust proof, water resistant, and can be safely submerged in up to a meter of liquid for 30 minutes. The Pixel, by contrast, won’t hold up quite as well against the elements. It’s rated IP53, which means it’s guaranteed to withstand limited exposure to dust and “water spray less than 60 degrees from vertical” — in other words, the occasional spray from a wayward garden hose. Since both phones have glass on the back, neither is terribly durable when it comes to falls onto pavement. The Pixel has less glass and more metal, so it should theoretically withstand drops better. The galaxy S7’s back glass is also curved, which means it is expensive to replace. The Pixel’s glass cutout may be hard to replace, too. In this case, the Galaxy S7 wins on durability only because of water resistance. When it comes to falls, these two are pretty equal. Winner: Galaxy S7 Software While the Galaxy S7 and Pixel both run Android, the similarities run only surface deep. The Pixel ships with the newest version of Android onboard, 7.1 Nougat, which confers myriad improvements over the previous generation. There are Launcher Shortcuts, which provide quick access to activities and settings menus within apps (pressing and holding a Google Maps icon, for instance, might include entries for turn-by-turn navigation to saved locations). A new split-screen mode lets you use two apps side by side. Notifications sport Direct Reply, a feature that allows you to respond to incoming messages from Facebook, Hangouts, and more from the tray. That’s not all the Pixel is packing. The Pixel Launcher, the Pixel’s default homescreen, has a nifty a pull-up dock for quick access to apps. The Pixel tightly integrates the Google Assistant, Google’s eponymous AI-powered helper: pressing and holding on the home button summons an assistant that can perform tasks like playing YouTube videos, texting friends via WhatsApp, making restaurant reservations with OpenTable, and showing you photos you took last November. Related: Everything you need to know about Android 7.1 Nougat and the Pixel Launcher The Pixel ships, too, with a Google Photos benefit: every photo you take with the Pixel uploads to Google’s cloud storage service. Google’s new text and video messaging apps, Allo and Duo, come pre-installed. And there’s an app that provides 24/7 live customer care — if you encounter an issue, you can reach a support agent via chat and even share your screen to let the agent see what you’re seeing. You’ll also get instant software updates to the latest version of Android, and with them, much needed security patches. That’s a huge win for the Pixel. Samsung Galaxy S7More Samsung Galaxy S7 Digital Trends The Galaxy S7 isn’t without software exclusives of its own. It’s running a customized version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Samsung’s bubbly, colorful TouchWiz interface atop it. It sports a mode that lets you record gameplay, a highly customizable Do Not Disturb mode, and battery-saving features galore. There are a few diamonds in the rough. Take Samsung Pay: by leveraging a hardware component known as MST, or magnetic secure transmission, Samsung’s app is able to emulate a debit or credit card swipe on standard magnetic readers — even those which don’t support Android Pay or Apple Pay. And there’s Samsung+, a loyalty app which gives Samsung fans access to exclusive perks and deals. It also offers live customer service, much like you’ll see on the Pixel. The Galaxy S7 may pack an impressive range of features, but it will never get timely updates to the latest version of Android, and it takes too long to get much-needed security patches. Samsung has one of the worst reputations in the industry when it comes to software updates. The Pixel is the exact opposite. Much like Apple’s iPhones, it will get instant software updates. If security updates matter to you, the Pixel is the one to buy. We’re going to have the software win to the Pixel. Not only is it running the latest version of Android, but it sports an abundance of Google’s latest and greatest. Winner: Pixel Pricing and availability Neither the Galaxy S7 nor the Pixel come cheap. In the U.S., the Galaxy S7 starts at $670 unlocked. It’s available from Samsung’s web store, Amazon, eBay, and brick-and-mortar retailers like Best Buy, Sam’s Club, and Target. The Pixel, by comparison, is a lot harder to nab stateside. In terms of wireless carriers, it’s available exclusively through Verizon and Google Fi, Google’s eponymous wireless service. Otherwise, it’s available unlocked from the Google Play Store. We recommend you buy it unlocked from the Play Store, so you’re not locked to a carrier for two years. Google even offers financing. Galaxy S7 Pixel Verizon $672 or $28 per month for 24 months $650 or $27 a month for 24 months T-Mobile $640 or $27 per month for 24 months Sprint $650 or $27 per month for 24 months AT&T $695 or $23 for 30 months U.S. Cellular $620 prepaid; $672 or $28 for 24 months); $200 with 2-year contract Unlocked $670 in full $650 or $27 a month for 24 months Worth noting: Google’s throwing in a free virtual reality headset for those who pre-order the Pixel. Sprint is providing “eligible buyers” the choice of a free Gear VR and $50 content bundle or free Samsung 256GB memory card. Related: Everything you need to know about Google Assistant The Galaxy S7 undoubtedly wins the availability category. The Pixel has the unfortunate distinction of being a Verizon exclusive in the U.S. — short of shelling out for an unlocked model or opting for monthly financing, you won’t see it on competing networks anytime soon. That’s certainly not the case where the Galaxy S7’s concerned. Winner: Galaxy S7 Winner: Pixel (for now) It’s always a challenge to compare a brand-new, top-of-the-line phone with an aging competitor (the Galaxy S7 came out in the spring, believe it or not). But in this case, the comparison’s an apt one: the Pixel, as the smaller and less generously endowed of Google’s two new HTC-made smartphones, contrasts Samsung’s former flagship in unexpected ways. The Pixel packs a more powerful processor and ostensibly superior cameras, but falls short in the areas of display and battery. The Galaxy S7’s screen not only packs twice the amount of pixels in a roughly the same amount of space, but a larger battery, too. That said, there’s software to consider. The Pixel packs quick access to the Google Assistant, free cloud-based photo storage, and the promise of frequent software devices far into the future. In the end, it comes down to what you prioritize. If you can actually see the difference between 1080p and Quad HD (most people can’t), if you need a water resistant phone, if you’re all set up for wireless charging, if you want expandable storage, and if you don’t mind never getting timely software updates, the Galaxy S7 is the one for you. However, if you care about timely software updates, if you want Stock Android, if you hate glass phones, and if you really want to use Assistant to the max, buy the Pixel. Technically, the Galaxy S7 wins in this spec war, but we’d say the Pixel wins the software war, and when it comes down to it, we think software is more important.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Charter, like AT&T, sues Louisville to stall Google Fiber Charter also claims 1st Amendment violation of right to “speak” as TV provider. by Jon Brodkin - Oct 5, 2016 6:22 pm UTC Login to bookmark 82 Bardstown Road in Louisville, Kentucky. Scott Smithson Charter Communications has sued the local government in Louisville and Jefferson County, Kentucky, in order to stop a new ordinance that gives Google Fiber easier access to utility poles. Charter’s complaint in US District Court in Louisville on Friday (full text) is similar to one filed earlier by AT&T. Like AT&T before it, Charter wants to stop Louisville Metro’s One Touch Make Ready ordinance that lets new entrants like Google Fiber make all of the necessary wire adjustments on utility poles instead of having to wait for incumbent providers to send work crews to move their own wires. Charter alleges that the ordinance violates its Fifth Amendment property rights and could cause service outages for its customers if Google Fiber’s installers make mistakes. Charter, the second biggest cable company in the US, is also mad that both AT&T and Google Fiber face less onerous restrictions in their TV franchise agreements than it does. Charter claims the differential treatment violates its First Amendment right to “speak” as a cable TV provider but did not point to any specific “speech” that has been suppressed. Charter began operating in Louisville earlier this year when it acquired Time Warner Cable (TWC), the owner of Insight Communications’ operations in Kentucky. Charter is providing service under the terms of a franchise agreement with Louisville that expired in 2010 and says Louisville has refused to rewrite the deal to make it less burdensome. It isn’t uncommon for cities and towns to give less strict franchise agreements to new entrants than to incumbents, which have advantages over newcomers because they built out to customers first. While Charter argues that the disparity in Louisville violates its First Amendment speech rights, it doesn't actually claim that it has been prevented from making any speech. After all, Louisville's rules don't prevent Charter from offering cable television channels. But the different rules in each franchise agreement make it “less burdensome and expensive for [Charter’s] competitors to speak in Louisville,” violating the principle that “the government may not favor one similarly situated member of the press or other speaker over another without special justification,” Charter argued. The "burdensome regulatory treatment" faced by Charter impairs its "ability to speak relative to Google’s and AT&T’s ability to speak," the complaint said. Charter’s claim that it is entitled to First Amendment speech protections “free from discriminatory and unwarranted interference by any government entity” derives from a 1994 Supreme Court case involving Turner Broadcasting System and the Federal Communications Commission. The precedent isn’t a slam dunk for Charter, though. It centered on “must carry” rules that force cable television providers to carry broadband stations. The court recognized cable TV providers' status as "speakers" under the First Amendment but in a subsequent case ruled that they must carry provisions that are consistent with the First Amendment. Charter listed numerous “disparate regulatory burdens” it faces in Louisville, including requirements to provide three local TV channels and pay for construction of public access studios; respond to repair and maintenance requests and complaints within 24 hours; and provide credits or rebates to compensate subscribers for service interruptions. AT&T and Google Fiber don’t face these obligations, Charter’s complaint said. Google Fiber pole access challenged Charter’s challenge to the One Touch Make Ready ordinance alleges a violation of Fifth Amendment property rights and state utility laws. The Louisville ordinance gives Google Fiber “a government-sanctioned license physically to invade, take possession of, move, and interfere with [Charter’s] property,” the complaint said. While Charter owns its wires, the poles are owned by AT&T and the Louisville Gas & Electric Company, and wires are placed in public rights-of-way. One Touch Make Ready ordinances are so named because they allow one company to perform all of the “make ready” work on utility poles in a single visit instead of requiring each entity to move its own wires to make way for new ones. Google Fiber has pushed for One Touch Make Ready ordinances in multiple cities, arguing that incumbent providers cause unreasonable delays in access to utility poles. Nashville, Tennessee, followed in Louisville’s footsteps by passing a One Touch ordinance last month, and AT&T sued to stop it only two days later. Google Fiber has begun offering service in parts of Nashville, but the company says it hasn't been able to deploy more quickly because of pole access delays. Google Fiber has not yet committed to offering service in Louisville despite receiving a franchise agreement. Charter argues that Louisville Metro’s ordinance is preempted by the Kentucky Public Service Commission’s authority over pole attachments. While One Touch Make Ready could bring Google Fiber to customers sooner, Charter argues that its own subscribers could lose service if Google Fiber installers mess up. Companies attaching new wires are required to indemnify pole owners for damages caused under One Touch Make Ready but are not required to indemnify third-party attachers like Charter, the complaint said. Google Fiber doesn’t have to provide advance notice before moving Charter’s wires unless Google Fiber believes the work would likely cause a customer outage, Charter said. "It is unclear how a new attacher could reliably make this determination without consulting the third party to understand the likely effect of its work on the third party’s network,” Charter said. “Where it has not provided advance notice, the new attacher must give notice that it has relocated or altered a pre-existing third party user’s attachments within 30 days after performing that work,” Charter also wrote. “The pre-existing third party attacher is then given only 14 days to inspect the relocation or alteration of its facilities by the provider and make any claim of damage or other complaint.” Charter asked the court to declare the One Touch Make Ready ordinance invalid and to force Louisville to treat Charter, AT&T, and Google Fiber the same in franchise requirements. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer’s office does not comment on pending litigation, a spokesperson told Ars.

The history is easily overlooked. The creation of the power and telecommunication infrastructure happened by right-of-way being taken by local governments for the common good. In most cases they didn't seize the property itself, just the right to use it for public utilities. For Charter to now claim they have a 5th amendment right to control property *they never bought*, just to block further use for the public good, should be slapped down. Lots of people gave up use of their land, intrusion into their privacy and obstruction of their view to further progress. Individuals might have grumbled, but it was overwhelmingly recognized as being needed for the greater good. There would never have been that support if they knew the ultimate result would be a permanent exclusive grant to a obstructionist private monopoly. 282 posts | registered 4/2/2013 Reader comments 82 You must login or create an account to comment.

Our game, Maruta 279, was one of the finalists at the Google Play Indie Games Festival, and I wanted to share my experience of being a part of that event. First of all, some background about our game. Maruta 279 is a stealth-puzzle game that takes place inside a cloning facility in the dystopian future. We’re a small team: I’m the programmer and artist, Gabsung Lim is the sound designer and Alex Park helped us  with the game’s early story concepts. We’ve been working on this game since late January on a part-time basis, as I was still in school at the time, while Gab and Alex have other obligations. Back in July, I saw on MobileSyrup that Google was taking submissions for the Indie Games Festival it planned to hold. I submitted our game — entry was free and easy — but I didn’t expect that our game to be picked. I thought our chances were slim; there are a ton of games in development in U.S. and Canada that are a lot more polished (Maruta 279 is still in alpha). So imagine our surprise when we heard from Google that our game was selected for the event! We were beyond excited to be a part of Google’s first indie games festival in North America, and we were also surprised to hear that we were the only Canadian developer in attendance at the event. Big pressure! The time between the end of August and the day of the event is a blur for me because I worked on the game nonstop. Maruta was roughly 60 percent done as of September, so there was a lot of work to be done. Level design, user interface, balancing, and many other aspects of the game were in a constant state of flux, and I still had to optimize the game for Android for the event. In fact, the Android build was running at 15 frames per second two week before the event, due to some changes I had made recently. Luckily, after a couple of sleepless nights, I got the game running at 30 frames per second on a Galaxy S6 a week before the event. Samsung Canada was a big help. We were asked to bring three devices to the event, but we only had one Galaxy S6 at the time. Luckily, Samsung Canada was nice enough to loan us several Galaxy S devices to use during the event, so we were able to have plenty of devices for the demo day. We had to come to the venue the day before the event to set up and rehearse. I showed up early, and it was very cool to see everything being set up at the beautiful Terra Gallery in San Francisco. Even before everything was set up, the venue felt very modern and slick. I think it’s great that Google picked this kind of a venue for the event, as opposed to a normal conference space. The event itself was incredibly fun. There were a ton of people at the event from every age group, and we received very positive feedback from the people who played the game. To be honest, we are making Maruta 279 for ourselves, so our target audience is people like us — gamers in their mid 20s who play traditional games as well as mobile games and love challenge — but it was interesting to see how casual gamers, younger and older than us, were enjoying the game as well. Also, some of the previous events we went to with this game were business-to-business conferences, but this event was mostly consumers, so it was great to get their feedback. Being right next to the gamers as they played the game, I could see when they were enjoying the game and I identified some things in the game that we need to fix. After about five hours of demoing, the judges announced their top picks from the 30 games at the event. Maruta 279 didn’t make the cut, but I was happy to see other excellent games, like Numbo Jumbo, get the top prizes. Numbo Jumbo is a very addictive game about arithmetic, and it’s my favourite game right now. Also, developers that didn’t get one of the top prizes still got Android TV consoles and controllers from Nvidia and Razer. I’d been meaning to get my hands on an Android TV console to port the game to, so I was happy to get these. The day wrapped with presentations and a cocktail party. I got to relax and chat with other devs and Googlers, which was a big treat as well. Overall, I learned a lot from attending this event and I want to thank Google for putting together an amazingly cool event like this. Every game that I’ve tried at the event was highly entertaining and unique, so I recommend you look up all the games from the event. Maruta 279 is coming out in a few months, so please look forward to it as well.

Sharing Options Share on Facebook Share Twitter Plus one on Google Plus Save on Stumble Upon Pin on Pintrest Share on Reddit By Aiden Dalby By Aiden Dalby in News 1 month ago Google are trying to move away from providing services you use on other company’s hardware to making the devices you use to access their services. With a new phone, Wi-Fi device, VR headset, voice-controlled assistant and Chromecast they are aiming to be a part of every part of your home life. Google’s voice-controlled software Google Assistant is being integrated into these devices either directly such as with Google Pixel or via another one of the devices they announced, such as activating Chromecast Ultra through Google Home. It appears that Google have no problem showing that their targeting rival devices, with the Pixel phone clearly attacking Apple’s iPhone and the Google Home trying to get into homes to replace Amazon’s Echo. It even poked fun at the iPhone 7’s lack of headphone jack when discussing the Pixel phone. We critique of Google for the lack of originality, as nothing it has coming out is particularly mind-blowing but it is making devices with features that it feels people are missing from rival companies. We’ve had some hands-on time with some of the devices and we’re ready to let you know the essential information.   1. Google Pixel They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but Apple may not like what they see. Google hasn’t just copied and pasted the iPhone and given it a different logo, they it has tweaked the concept and added features to target those who were put off by the iPhone 7. The Pixel has a five-inch screen (441ppi) and the XL has a 5.5-inch display (534ppi), they come with either 32GB or 128GB of memory. Inside there is 4GB RAM and a quad-core Snapdragon 821. While more android phones and even apple have included dual lens cameras, Google has stuck with a single 12MP f/2.0 lens at the rear and an 8MP at the front. The Pixel is a phone you can control entirely with a single hand. With some devices certain acts require you to hold the phone with one hand whilst making gestures with the other. With the convenient placement of the touchpad on the back, with the Pixel we could unlock the phone, scroll through websites, turn on the camera and access the assistant all without having to use a second hand.     2.Google Assistant A serious Siri competitor. Google Assistant is accessed by saying “okay Google” or by holding the home button. It works intelligently, you can ask it how to get home and then a follow up question can be asked without having to preface it. You can also ask it questions based on what is on the screen and the assistant will recognise what you are referring too.   3.Google Chromecast Ultra For those unfamiliar with Chromecast, you plug it into your TVs HDMI input and you can then stream from video sites such as Netflix or YouTube using the companion app. If a service isn’t available then you can display what is on your devices screen through Google Chrome. The Chromecast ultra has been given better hardware to make it faster and is capable of 4K streaming with HDR support. There is an input for Ethernet, for 4K streaming this is a great to ensure the picture quality is at its best and it provides a more reliable connection. It will also work with Google home when it launches.   4. Google Home   Google’s intelligent assistant has a modern design with interchangeable base so you can change it suit your home. Access news, music or ask it questions just by using your voice. When you ask it a question the assistant will refer to Google, if it cannot find the answer directly then it will refer to a site that does have the answer. Inside the Home, there are two omnidirectional microphones to pick up voice commands and it has a high-excursion driver with dual passive radiators to give a well-rounded sound. It currently has no planned release outside of the US but with the assistant software already available on the Pixel it is a question of when it will be released outside of the US rather than if.   5. Google Wi-Fi   Made to work with your router, it provides a stronger Wi-Fi signal throughout the house. One device covers up to 1500 square feet but more devices can be added for larger homes. Using the Google Wi-Fi app you can pause the signal on devices connected to the router, great for getting kid’s attention. In the background the devices monitor signal to provide you with the best connection possible.     6. Daydream View   Google’s Headset lets you immerse yourself in virtual experiences such as tours of famous locations. You can also watch videos and the controller included allows you to play games. The Headset is compatible with any Daydream-ready phone (such as the Pixel). You can experience VR games and films easily, to start it all you have to do is put the phone into headset, the phone will know when it’s in and will go straight into Daydream mode. When your done the remote fits into the headset so you don’t loose it. Street View has over 150 virtual tours of places all around the world, YouTube lets you watch its entire library on a virtual big screen and Daydream View has 360 panoramic videos. It is available in three colours: Slate, Snow and Crimson, the headset is made with a soft fabric making it lighter than other portable VR headsets on the market and it fits well even when wearing glasses.   Google Pixel costs £600/ $650 Google Chromecast Ultra costs £70 / $70 Google Home costs $130 / UK Price TBC Google Wi-Fi costs $130 / UK Price TBC Daydream View costs £70 / $80 For more information visit google.com Share on Facebook Share Twitter Plus one on Google Plus Save on Stumble Upon Pin on Pintrest Share on Reddit On sale today Buy Online Subscribe Now View Digital Editions ×Close Hello again!

Check out PHP: The Right Way CloudWays Blog: How To Add ReCAPTCHA To Symfony 3 Forms by Chris Cornutt Oct 05, 2016 @ 12:19:31 The Cloudways blog has a tutorial posted helping you add CAPTCHA functionality of your Symfony 3 form handling. In this case they're adding the Google reCAPTCHA handling to a registration form for users of your system. Websites use different techniques and methods to validate contact, login and user registration forms. Some opt for custom validation methods while a large majority deploy third-party validation techniques. Google provides a well known and proven validation tool known as reCAPTCHA. In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to add Google reCAPTCHA to a Symfony 3 registration form. Hence, if you’re looking for a Recaptcha Symfony union, you’ve got it! They start by helping you set up a Cloudways PHP application and install the latest version of the Symfony 3 framework on it as a sample application. They then walk you through the steps required to create a reCAPTCHA application and hooking it into your Cloudways server's hostname. With that set up they move over into the Symfony application, generating the User entity via Doctrine and creating the matching view/controller to handle the reCAPTCHA output. The registration form is then created and the handling is added to verify the CAPTCHA value submitted against the Google servers. tagged: cloudways recaptcha symfony3 form registration tutorial google Link: https://www.cloudways.com/blog/add-recaptcha-to-symfony-3-forms/ Trending Topics: tutorial podcast laravel community series interview introduction release framework voicesoftheelephpant All content copyright, PHPDeveloper.org :: info@phpdeveloper.org

Anushka Naiknaware (13) was placed in the top eight in an international science contest run by Google. She won the Lego Education Builder Award, which included the scholarship, a free trip to Lego world headquarters in Denmark and a year of entrepreneurship mentoring from a Lego executive, reported The Oregonian. Large wounds must be kept moist to promote healing, but changing bandages too often to check moisture levels can make things worse. To solve that problem, Ms. Naiknaware, a seventh-grader at Stoller Middle School in Portland, designed and tested a bandage that is embedded with tiny monitors. They can sense moisture levels and allow medical workers to determine whether the dressing has dried out enough that the bandage needs to be changed. Ms. Naiknaware created the sensors by printing a fractal pattern using ink containing graphene nano-particles. The particles can accurately detect when moisture levels have dropped.Youngest winner Google judges named her one of 16 global finalists, all of whom travelled to the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, to present their project. Ms. Naiknaware was the youngest person to win one of the global prizes. She told The Oregonian that being able to interact, debate and play with 19 other curious teen scientists from across the world was one of her favourite life experiences. Another, she said, was the moment she saw her bandage prototype work. “My idea became a physical, tangible reality,” said Ms. Naiknaware. She said she hopes to use her Lego mentor’s advice to figure out how to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for her bandages so a company can produce them at scale. — AP Keywords: Bandage, Oregon teen, bandage invention More In: Science | Sci-Tech Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

Though Verizon Wireless will be the only carrier to sell the devices, you can also buy it unlocked from Google. In addition to being compatible with GSM and CDMA networks, the devices work with carriers that use Wi-Fi networks first or by default. This includes Google's own Project Fi and Republic Wireless, a startup that says users can activate the Pixel phones as part of its Bring Your Own Phone program. Currently, there are 12 phones that are compatible with Republic Wireless' network. With the addition of the two Pixel handsets, the carrier's lineup expands to keep up with Google's newest phones, which ship with the latest Android 7.1 Nougat operating system. Because Republic Wireless prioritizes local Wi-Fi networks to patch through calls and send text messages (and then fall back on Sprint and T-Mobile's networks whenever Wi-Fi isn't available), customers can usually save money by cutting down on data costs.

War on Apple, war on Amazon, war on Samsung. War, even, on perceptions of what the search engine giant is capable of in the consumer space. At Tuesday’s much hyped event, Google made its strongest ever declaration that, more so than any other competitor, it is best positioned to become ubiquitous in every aspect of a person’s digital life. Competitors, allies, and security concerns be damned. It started with a relaunch. Or, rather, a rebirth. Nexus, Google’s homegrown smartphone brand since 2010, is no more. Instead, we now have Pixel. Nexus devices were built in cooperation with Android manufacturers to be reference devices, something developers and users alike could enjoy for their “pure” software experience and their mid- to high-end specifications. It was all served in reasonably attractive designs and for reasonably attractive prices (2014’s Nexus 6 notwithstanding). Pixel changes that. Brushing aside Android manufacturers — mainly Samsung — who compete to take on Apple’s iPhone, Google has decided to do things itself. With that move goes any pretence of sharing branding. HTC (who built the first Android device way back in 2008) might be constructing Google’s new phones, but their name appears nowhere on the Pixel and its larger sibling, the Pixel XL. These are “made by Google,” as advertising claims, from the inside out. Google Pixel, Photo: Google On the face of it, Google’s strategy is sound. They alone are best positioned to tackle the strongest aspect of the iPhone: Apple’s control over every aspect, from hardware to software. Google develops Android. Google designed the Pixel devices. The parallels are glaringly obvious. That makes it all the more surprising — or, perhaps, appropriate — that Google’s first foray into Apple-style smartphones should be so derivative. At a glance, neither the 5-inch Pixel nor the 5.5-inch Pixel XL could be described as beautiful. Parallels with the iPhone abound, from the large bezels to the antenna bands, the curved sides to the glass and metal backs. If Google truly wanted to stand out, they should have made the anti-iPhone. Last year’s Nexus 6P had Cylon chic. The Pixel feels familiar — and not in a good way. The Pixel feels familiar — and not in a good way. Google at least ticked most of the boxes that mattered when it came to specs. Apart from the smaller Pixel having a 5-inch, 1080p display and the larger adding half an inch and Quad HD resolution, their internals are identical. The latest Qualcomm processor, 4GB of RAM, up to 128GB of storage, AMOLED displays, rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, tough Corning Gorilla Glass 4, and USB Type-C fast charging that can add 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes. While Apple embraces dual cameras, Google is touting that its single 12.3 megapixel sensor is currently the best in the world — as measured by independent tester DxOMark. It’s got large, light-absorbing pixels, a smarter Auto HDR+ function, and a revised camera app that launches faster and takes photos quicker and more accurately. To bolster their claims, anyone who buys a Pixel phone will get free, unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. Google Pixel and Pixel XL, Photo: Google Running everything is Android 7.1, Google’s latest version of their homegrown software. But unlike Nexus devices of old, Google has abandoned offering “pure” Android and instead developed a skin on top that adds new icons, a new app launcher, easier access to Google’s search app, and various other improvements and tweaks for usability. There’s even 24/7 support by either phone or chat, with users able to share their screen with Google’s engineers to diagnose any problems that arise. The smaller Pixel starts at $649. The larger Pixel tops out at $869. That’s iPhone money. Unfortunately, the Pixels aren’t perfect. There’s no microSD card support, no waterproofing, their batteries aren’t the largest, their profiles aren’t the slimmest, their design is certainly far from the best out there (that’s currently a toss-up between the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 Edge). This would be fine if Google were charging Nexus money, but they’re not. Pixel is Google’s premium brand, appearing previously on a Chromebook and Android tablet. The smaller Pixel starts at $649. The larger Pixel tops out at $869. That’s iPhone money. It took Samsung six generations of Galaxy and five generations of Note to justify charging what Apple can for its smartphones. Google is doing so right out of the gate. That’s a bold assumption, not just that its devices are worthy of the price tag, but that consumers, who’ve thus far opted for Galaxy over Nexus, will be willing to pay that much for a phone with a Google logo on the back. So, where’s the value? For Google, it’s seemingly in Assistant. Google Assistant is the search giant’s rival for Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. It’s a powerful, knowledgeable, constantly-learning AI that can engage in conversational search queries with users to facilitate their day-to-day activities. And it’s built into both Pixel phones. Ask your phone to find movies in your area and it will. Tell it “I need to bring my kids” and Google’s conversation ability will connect your statement to the previous search and then filter films by rating. Check your schedule, plan for lunch, and Google Assistant will find a restaurant, book a table and add it to your calendar, all without opening an app. It’s Google’s attempt to elbow into an area where users would previously have had to open multiple apps and input multiple fields of data just to get things done — and all without needing to know specific voice commands. Just tell Assistant what you need and it’ll do it, Google claims. Google Assistant, Photo: Google It’s something that conveys to Google’s other big announcement, Google Home, their answer to Amazon’s Echo. Two years after Amazon first launched its Alexa-powered speaker, Google is finally ready to do battle, but they’re seriously behind. Echo has 3,000 apps that allow users to search, buy, order, question, and command various aspects of their life. Home won’t launch with the same level of third-party support. Instead, it’ll focus on the basics: answering questions, controlling smart home products such as lights, playing music from Spotify, YouTube Music, Google Play and other sources, and setting timers, creating shopping lists and offering traffic updates, among other things. It’ll also connect with Google’s other products. If you own Google’s Chromecast streaming dongle, wake Google Home with “OK Google” and ask it to show you videos of John Oliver. It’ll connect to your Chromecast, automatically turn on your TV, load up YouTube and stream Last Week Tonight — all without pressing a button. Google Home, Photo: Google The $129 Home, which launches in November, offers support for multiple devices and will intelligently respond depending on which Home is closest to the person speaking. But it’s the potential for the future that is most impressive. Google is changing its core mandate — search — from something universal into something personal. Google’s event wasn’t really about Pixel, or Home, or its Daydream View virtual reality headset, or its Wifi routers, or its new, Ultra HD Chromecast. It was about Assistant. And it was about positioning Assistant as something that will become pervasive in a person’s life. With Assistant on a phone, learning a person’s daily routine, detecting the locations they visit, liaising with the apps they install, responding to them and planning their lives, that’s a lot of data for Google to process. It’s data that can be shared directly with Home. Or with any other system that integrates Assistant, such as cars or computers in future. Google’s new products, Photo: Google Google is changing its core mandate — search — from something universal into something personal. It’s no coincidence that teasers for the Pixel launch showcased a Google search bar transforming into the outline of a phone. Assistant is Google search everywhere, in all parts of our life. Is that a security concern? For some, absolutely. They’ll worry about Google knowing too much about them, using data to drive advertisements or personalize products. But the potential is, without doubt, tempting. An ever-evolving AI, smarter than Siri, more instant than Google Search, always ready to help. Apple trades on its exemplary hardware. Samsung trades on offering an alternative to Apple. Amazon is pushing into the home to get people hooked on its purchasing platform. Google’s Pixel phones are expensive, relatively uninteresting, and undoubtedly polished, while Home is a fledgling but promising smart home speaker system. But it’s Assistant that Google will be trading on in future. Google, everywhere, all the time. What remains to be seen is whether consumers buy into it. Or whether its inevitability doesn’t hinge on people buying a potentially overpriced “made by Google” smartphone anyway. Assistant is the future, whether we want it or not. Pixel, Pixel XL and Google Home are available to pre-order now directly from Google. Feed Your Email News, Reviews, Contests, Coverboy, Discounts and More!

Lee Oct 5, 2016, 1:40pm EDT tweet share Google CEO Sundar Pichai Ramin Talaie/Getty Images Google’s Android dominates the smartphone market overall, but Apple has attracted a disproportionate share of high-end users — and consequently an outsize share of smartphone profits. At a Tuesday event, Google unveiled a two-pronged strategy to change that. Part one was the Pixel, the first smartphone that will be designed and manufactured by Google. Google is betting that building its own phone will allow it to offer the same kind of seamless user experience Apple provides its own users. But the second prong of Google’s strategy is more original and received more attention on Tuesday. The company wants to make voice-based artificial intelligence a much bigger part of how people interact with their smartphones. Google envisions a future where you’ll make restaurant reservations, look up photos, and play music by talking to your phone instead of tapping and swiping on its screen. This article is part of New Money, a new section on economics, technology, and business. Obviously, this isn’t a totally new idea, as all the major smartphone platforms have had voice-based personal assistants — Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana — for several years. But Google says it’s about to make this technology a lot better — so much better that people will use it a lot more. If anyone can pull this off, it’s Google. Making AI really good requires a lot of data to “train” sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Wrangling large amounts of data has always been Google’s specialty. But even if the company can build a voice-based AI that can really understand a wide variety of requests, I’m still skeptical it will change the smartphone game as much as Google hopes. Apple’s knack for design is a big advantage in the smartphone market Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Apple has a designed-focused culture and is known for its polished, elegant, and user-friendly user interfaces. By contrast, Google has a culture that’s focused on delivering fast and reliable online services. Google’s business model for Android puts it at a further disadvantage in the user interface department. Apple designs both the hardware and software for the iPhone, allowing it to guarantee users a seamless experience. Google, by contrast, licenses Android as open source software to dozens of smartphone manufacturers, many of which customize it themselves, leading to a cacophony of different and often mediocre user interfaces. The iPhone’s greater polish is a big reason the iPhone is disproportionately popular at the high end of the market, and why Apple is able to charge a healthy premium for the iPhone. Android has the biggest market share in the smartphone business overall, but Google earns much less in profit from the smartphone business than Apple does. Many iPhone users nevertheless enjoy Google services like search, maps, and Gmail. But the fact that the iPhone’s operating system sits between Google and many of its users gives Apple a lot of leverage. In 2014, Google paid Apple $1 billion to maintain its status as the default search engine on the iPhone. Google is trying to build a truly useful voice-based assistant Google’s Mario Queiroz shows off Google Home, Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The executives onstage never said so explicitly, but several of Google’s announcements on Tuesday were clearly aimed at knocking Apple from its high-end smartphone throne. Most obviously, the Android Pixel is Google’s most direct challenge yet to the iPhone. Google’s earlier line of Nexus phones were designed and manufactured by third parties; by contrast, Google is planning to bring most of this work in house for Pixel. The hope is that by owning the whole “stack” — software, hardware, and online service — Google will be able to match the seamless user experience Apple has long offered to its users. But Google doesn’t just want to ape the iPhone; it wants a way to differentiate its products from the iPhone. Google believes its real secret weapon is a new user interface based on voice recognition and artificial intelligence. In a sense, this is just a souped-up version of Google’s existing voice recognition feature, Google Now. Apple and Microsoft have their own competing versions, Siri and Cortana. And these products don’t seem to have had a big impact on the market. But Google believes that’s just because the technology is not good enough yet. Google has been working to improve its voice feature in three directions: Google is planning to improve the voice recognition capability itself, improving accuracy of the speech recognition and increasing the complexity of requests it can understand. Google has been working on other AI-based technologies — like advanced image recognition — to expand the range of requests Google’s personal assistant can handle. Google is expanding its personal assistant to more devices, particularly Google Home, a new wifi-connected speaker that competes with the Amazon Echo. An example can help to illustrate what Google has in mind here. Right now, if you want to look at photos from a vacation you took last summer, you’d open your photo app and scroll back until you find the date you want. Google envisions a totally different approach. You’d say, “Okay, Google, show me pictures from my vacation last July.” Android would understand the request and call up the photos. Google’s Photos app demonstrates that Google is already well on its way to developing the image recognition technology to make this work. You can already ask Google Photos to show you photos that contain snow, or a dog, or a particular friend. Google hopes to bring these capabilities — and more — to its personal assistant, so you can ask complex queries like, “Show me pictures from 2014 that have Aunt Lisa and dogs in them.” It’s easy to be skeptical of this kind of thing, since the existing smartphone “personal assistant” technologies aren’t very good. They get confused often enough that it’s usually easier to just do things the old-fashioned way. But artificial intelligence technology is advancing rapidly, and Google insists that it will soon be good enough that voice-based personal assistants will “just work.” If voice-based search becomes capable enough, it could reach a tipping point where it’s easier to just ask the voice assistant for the information you need than to open up the appropriate app and find it the old-fashioned way. This would be particularly good news for Google because it would play to the company’s strengths. It would essentially be putting search back at the center of the user experience. Making this kind of smart voice assistant work will require oceans of information. Computer scientists have found that tasks like image and voice recognition work best when they have huge numbers of examples they can use to “train” the algorithms. A smart AI system also needs to know lots of facts about the world so that it can respond to complex queries. Collecting and organizing information has always been one of Google’s strengths — after all, Google’s mission statement is to organize the world’s information. At the same time, it would downgrade Apple’s big strength — the ability to make elegant, user-friendly devices. If the main way people interact with smartphones is by asking them questions, the particular device will become less important — just as the advent of the web made the difference between PCs and Macs much less important. Google is also hoping to continue the shift toward more and more user data stored online instead of on users’ local devices. Pixel buyers get unlimited, free storage for their photos and videos. That’s a good selling point for the Pixel, but more importantly, it will mean that Google can offer users access to their content from any device. Google envisions a future where users ask their Google Home smart speaker to put photos from their vacation on the TV. That kind of future would play to Google’s strength — managing massive quantities of data online. Why AI might not be the secret weapon Google is hoping for Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images It’s easy to understand why Google would like to essentially make voice-based searches a central part of how people interact with their phones and other devices. But even if Google manages to build a sophisticated voice assistant that can respond to a wide variety of requests, I’m skeptical that will give Google a significant leg up in the smartphone wars. The canned demos in Google’s presentation were impressive, of course — canned demos usually are. But the question to ask is how much of the time we spend interacting with our smartphones would be improved by a smart voice assistant. One problem is that talking to your phone isn’t always convenient. There are many social settings — at the office, in line at the grocery store, on the bus — where people around you are likely to be annoyed if you’re constantly barking commands at your phone. In those situations, you’re going to want to discreetly type or scroll your way to the information you’re looking for, so people are still going to care how user-friendly the old-fashioned touch-based interface is. But more importantly, a lot of the time people spend on their phones — perhaps most of it — just wouldn’t be improved by a personal voice assistant. People spend a ton of time scrolling through posts on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, reading text messages, swiping through Tinder profiles, and so forth. Even with a task like finding photos, scrolling quickly through photo thumbnails will often be an easier way to find photos than trying to describe the photo you’re looking for. Often if you’re looking for an old photo, you don’t remember exactly when it was taken or what was in the photo. It’s helpful to scroll back to roughly the right time, look at a few photos at random, and use that to jog your memory about the context of the photo. This kind of browsing will probably always be faster on an old-fashioned touch-based interface than with voice-based queries. Disclosure: My brother works at Google. Was this article helpful?

That means either Alphabet's Google or Apple are most likely to buy the media platform, Levinsohn told CNBC's "Fast Money Halftime Report." Twitter would solve Apple's problem of creating a more news-oriented platform for its users, he said. For Google, it would create a Google-YouTube-Twitter media trifecta that would excite consumers, he added. With Twitter's market capitalization at more than $17 billion, the purchase would likely come in at around $20 billion, something that potential contenders like Salesforce, at $45 billion, cannot necessarily afford, especially when it comes to a "damaged" asset like Twitter, Levinsohn said. Levinsohn said he doesn't see Disney spending the $20 billion either, despite its move to bring Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey onto its board. Scott Mlyn | CNBC Ross Levinsohn Levinsohn called Dorsey "a brilliant guy" but said that with both Square and Twitter on his plate, it would be exceedingly difficult to strike an effective balance. "I think it's virtually impossible to run two companies. And both are very, very different and both are very, very challenged. And that's not to say there's anything wrong with Twitter," Levinsohn added. He said it simply takes a "different kind of environment" to help grow a media company going through the growth pains Twitter is experiencing. That environment, according to Levinsohn, involves a focused approach to the company's initiatives and faster innovation. He said the company has faced challenges in driving product cycles to be quicker. "It's OK to fail, it's not OK to fail slowly," he said. And, he added, a company like Twitter — which delivers news so quickly 24 hours a day, has been used by millions as their primary source of news and has proven itself a tool for political candidates — needs to move forward with a formidable power source behind it. "If I were Google and bought it, I would very much leave it as a stand-alone business to run, but I'd give it all the might and muscle that Google can bring to bear," Levinsohn said.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Spotify can now be integrated into your Google Home By Ida Torres - October 5, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The brand new Google Home is just the latest in the tech giant’s attempt to take over our lives. The smart home device is decorative and pretty useful around the house, especially in obeying our digital-related commands. Now if you’re a heavy Spotify user, you’ll be pleased to know that it is as easy as telling your Google Assistant (goodbye Google Now) to play whatever song or album or playlist that you want without having to touch any device. Those who are Spotify Premium subscribers and who live in the US and who are planing (or already have) the Google Home device will be able to say something as simple as “Ok Google, Play Spotify” and their music will suddenly fill up with their favorite tunes. You can also be as specific as asking to play your Discover Weekly selection or a specific album and playlist from among the tons that you can choose from with the music app. You will also be able to control the music directly from the Spotify app, if you prefer to do it “old school”. If you have Chromecast Audio or any of the Cast-enabled speakers, then you will also be able to enjoy the multi-room listening function from Spotify and Google Home. But you’d have to wait a little longer since Google Home will be available for purchase by November 4. A lot of Google fans will probably be scrambling to get one, nevermind that Amazon’s Echo was one of the first in the market. Let the battle of the smart home devices begin!

The device will start shipping in December and cost $129 - in-line with other mid-to-high range routers, or you can buy a three-pack for $299 if you would like to create a "mesh network." "It's modular, so you can get the right fit for your home's shape and sizes. Simply add wifi points to expand coverage," said Mario Queiroz, lead of the product management group within Google's hardware division. Google promises managing your bandwidth is easy using their app, and also promises that keeping your Internet connection fast is a top priority. Says Google: "Network Assist is intelligent software built into Google Wifi to provide you with the fastest possible speed. Behind the scenes, Network Assist automatically helps you avoid Wi-Fi congestion, and transitions you to the closest Wi-Fi point for the best signal. Network Assist will offer suggestions on how to optimize performance, like where to move a Google Wifi point for faster speeds or providing data so you can adjust your ISP plan."

The Linksys EA6400 is much faster, has DD-WRT support, and costs $10 less...and that is just one of many units already on the market that can beat Google WiFi in performance for less money. It is pretty amazing that they are previewing a ROUTER that won't be available for 2 months, which costs more than better units already in the wild, and their biggest selling point is that they actually expect people to buy three of these when it doesn't even make sense to buy one. If you are pre-ordering for any reason other than to do a review, just go over to Amazon and buy something better right now for less money. 25.10.2016 17:30 hearme0 Send private message to this user Senior Member Another frivolous Google venture to stay relevant in a stagnating technical world. 37.10.2016 15:55 g_slide Send private message to this user Member This might be good for senior citizens or non tech people, but I rather stick my Linksys Router.

Clay Bavor, the head of AR at Google, confirmed to CNET it’ll be available in November for $499 in the United States (around £391). The device, previewed at Lenovo’s Tech World event this summer, boasts four cameras to harness the power of the motion and depth sensing Tango software. Related: Google Project Tango explained Users will be able to enjoy a raft of Augmented Reality games and experiences such as a Dominos game that can be set up in AR using the layout of the real room. During the demo, hardware store Lowes demonstrated an app that would enable users to place items of furniture in their home and discover whether they would fit without needing a tape measure. The flagship worthy handset, which was originally scheduled to go on sale in September, has a 6.4-inch QHD display with 454ppi. Phab2 Pro also has a fingerprint sensor, a one-handed usage mode and a rather large 4050mAh battery. Of course, Google smartphone fans now face a choice between the VR-ready Pixel phones and the AR Tango phone. Will they one day exist in a single device? "You can imagine in the future you won't have to make a choice, but that's a bit further out," Bavor told CNET. No news yet on whether it will arrive in the UK.

By David Gilbert October 5, 2016 18:19 BST In the film Her Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with his operating system, voiced by Scarlett JohanssonWarner Bros. Entertainment We are at a "seminal" moment in the history of computing according to Google. "It's clear to me that we are evolving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the launch of its new Pixel smartphones. Google has been at the heart of the last two major shifts in computing. When the web revolution happened in the mid–1990s, it was the Google homepage which would become the face of the world wide web. Then, a decade ago, Google was at the centre of the smartphone revolution with Android, which made computing truly mobile. Now, it is positioning itself at the heart of the next big shift in computing – artificial intelligence. At the feature-packed San Francisco event on Tuesday, Pichai reinforced the idea that Google is at heart an AI company which is key as the idea of how we define computing changes. "Computing will be universally available, it will be everywhere in the context of the user's daily life," Pichai said. "People will be able to interact with it naturally and seamlessly than ever before. And above all else it will be intelligent." While Google may like to tell everyone it is an AI company, fundamentally it is still an advertising company at heart, but by leveraging the huge investment it has made in AI — and continues to do so — it will be able to make sure it continues to offer better services and of course, sell better ads. "The same deep learning and user profiling used to create smarter services helps advertising to be aimed more accurately, increasing value to advertisers, and driving Google's revenues," Ian Fogg, a mobile and telecoms analyst with IHS Markit told IBTimes UK. Can Google outsmart the competition? The Pixel is the first smartphone to come with Google's AI-powered Assistant baked in. Already available through the company's new messaging app Allo, the difference here is that Assistant can monitor everything you do and provide more contextually aware responses and suggestions, as well as tapping into Google's knowledge graph and the 70 billion facts it contains. All this makes Assistant potentially much more powerful than Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa or Microsoft's Cortana. While the smartphone is most people's main computing device, with them 24/7, it is not the only computing device people interact with and as the world becomes more connected, Google wants to put its Assistant everywhere and deliver on its goal "to build a personal Google for each and every user." This is why Google Home, the smart, voice-activated speaker which can answer questions, control music, order food and even turn on and off your lights, is such a vital product for Google's AI future. Google Home wireless speaker gives domiciles a sci-fi feel.Google While it is not available at launch in the UK, in the US it is priced at $50 less than the Amazon Echo, the product it most closely resembles and the one it is seeking to dominate. Changing the way we interact with technology forever By putting Assistant at the heart of everything you do at home, Google is hoping that as people become increasingly comfortable with interacting with computers using their voices, the company will soon have an vital role to play not only on your desktop, laptop and smartphone, but also the mundane everyday tasks you carry out at home. "It absolutely makes sense for Google to go big on AI and its Assistant," Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research said. "This is stuff that Google is already really good at, and a product like Home seems like a great place for the Google Assistant to shine. The focus here, though, should be on providing usable features everywhere, not just in Google-owned hardware." To that end Google will launch the Actions for Google SDK in December, which will allow developers to hook into Assistant to control other devices in the home – everything from your washing machine to your door locks – and even let services carry out two-way conversations with users. While there was no mention of Android Wear on Tuesday, the company's smartwatch operating system, you can be sure that when the next version of that is launched next year, Google Assistant will be baked in, available at the flick of a wrist. Think of every other hardware pie Google has a finger in — self-driving cars, smart thermostats, Wi-Fi routers, smart cameras, Google Glass and the myriad of "moonshot" products the company is working on — and you get some sense of the scale of how Assistant could help Google dominate computing for the next decade, just like it has on the web and mobile for the last 20 years.

More Tech Swing a wand in Google Daydream virtual reality Harry Potter app By Carli Velocci 10.05.2016 :: 9:30AM EST @velocciraptor Stay on target The UK is Getting a New Quidditch League Fantastic Comics For Harry Potter Fans, And Where To Find Them Many of us are still waiting for our Hogwarts acceptance letter (my owl got lost for 15 years), but during a Google announcement event on Tuesday, the company revealed that there will be another way to get that wizarding experience. An app based around Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is headed to Google’s VR headset, Google Daydream. Announced during the Made in Google event, the app will allow users to swing the controller like a wand. And that’s about all we know. One of the most common responses to the release of the AR app Pokémon Go was the need for a similar experience for Harry Potter fans. The Daydream app is similar, allowing you to go into VR and use the Daydream controller like a wand. It works like a Wii controller, allowing the user to wave it around for three-dimensional movement. There are few other details available in regards to the app, but you will have a wand, and isn’t that the most important thing? Google revealed a long list of software and features for Daydream, including the announcement of a Star Chart app that’ll allow users to explore the stars, and the  ability to watch Netflix, Hulu, and other media inside VR. Google Daydream is set to ship in November. There is no word on a release date for the Harry Potter app, but don’t be surprised if it comes out around the same time as the film. Daydream headsets will cost around $80. Customers can use them with Daydream-ready Pixel phones, which can be pre-ordered starting at around $650.

Zelda Real Escape Game Announced More Tech Google Pixel phone embraces the ‘satisfyingly not new’ headphone jack By Ryan Whitwam 10.05.2016 :: 7:35AM EST RyanWhitwam Google’s long-rumored Pixel phones have finally been announced alongside a raft of other products including the Google Home smart assistant and a 4K version of the Chromecast. When it announced the new Pixel and Pixel XL, Google alluded to something we all know deep down in our hearts — having a headphone jack is a good thing. So, Google took a subtle shot at Apple for removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. The Pixel phones are Google’s latest attempt at making in-house hardware. Whereas the Nexus phones it offered in previous years were explicitly created with OEM partners, the Pixels are being marketed as a fully Google-run operation. You can get all the gory details from our sister site, ExtremeTech. As it was running down all the new features of the Pixels, Google threw up a graphic that said, “3.5mm headphone jack satisfyingly not new.” Pointing out that your phone has a headphone jack hasn’t been necessary for the better part of a decade when the first few Android phones launched without a standard 3.5mm jack. They had adapters, which is exactly what the iPhone comes with. A lot of people are not pleased about the change. Talking about the headphone jack is Google’s way of burning Apple just a little. Of course, it’s not just Apple that Google is poking fun at. It’s also inadvertently burning Motorola, which it sold to Lenovo a few years back. Moto released its new flagships the Moto Z and Moto Z Force a few months ago, and they both lack headphone jacks. They come with a USB type-C to 3.5mm adapter instead. The day will come when it’s feasible to ditch the analog headphone jack, but Google doesn’t think it’s today.

 This isn’t the first time Google has launched an expensive phone Jeff Dunn Oct. 5, 2016, 1:03 PM 11,094 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   The Nexus is dead. Long live the Pixel. Google on Tuesday announced a new pair of flagship phones, the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL, and proclaimed that, this time, for real, it’s serious about selling smartphone hardware. To that end, it positioned the new devices as high-end phones with appropriately high-end prices: $649 and $769, respectively. As this chart from Statista shows, though, this isn’t the first time Google has dabbled with premium hardware. While it’s true that most Nexus phones were pitched as affordable and “good enough,” 2014’s Nexus 6 and 2011’s Galaxy Nexus (initially, at least) started at the same $649 price tag as the standard Pixel. Perhaps not coincidentally, both of those were sold through Verizon as well. Yes, the Pixel is not the Nexus. The software is more customized, and Google has reportedly been more hands-on in the development process. But it still isn’t making the phones (HTC is), and the benefits of owning them (fast updates) will be similar to before. Really, the biggest difference here seems to be marketing — Google has gone all out to make these look like its own smartphones. Time will tell if that’s enough to help Pixel succeed where Nexus faltered.

Google has released its October 2016 Android Security bulletin, providing patches for 78 identified vulnerabilities, seven of which are rated as critical. Once again, the fixes include commonly patched elements, including Qualcomm components and flaws that have already been patched in the upstream Linux kernel. The leading culprit of critical severity flaws in the October update is Qualcomm, with three issues (CVE-2016-3926, CVE-2016-3927 and CVE-2016-3929). Overall, there are 30 patched Qualcomm flaws in the October Android update. In addition to the three critical flaws, Qualcomm has 21 vulnerabilities rated as high and six rated as moderate severity. The Qualcomm vulnerabilities include privilege escalation and information disclosure related issues. Qualcomm has been a leading source of vulnerabilities in Android this year. In Google's July Android update, three critical and 36 high severity flaws in various Qualcomm components were patched. Qualcomm was also the root cause behind the QuadRooter flaws disclosed by security firm Check Point in August. Google has since patched the QuadRooter flaws, which could have enabled attackers to compromise vulnerable Android devices, in both August and in September. Among the other critical flaws patched in the October update is yet another set of issues that were previously patched in the upstream Linux kernel that Android is based upon. CVE-2016-0758 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ASN.1 decoder that was patched in the Linux kernel community in May. The CVE-2016-7117 vulnerability is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Linux kernel networking subsystem that was patched in the upstream community in March. "A remote code execution vulnerability in the kernel networking subsystem could enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel," Google warns in its CVE-2016-7117 advisory. Google is now also providing a patch for Android users for the CVE-2015-8955 vulnerability that was first fixed in the upstream Linux kernel in February. CVE-2015-8955 is a high severity, privilege elevation vulnerability in the kernel performance subsystem. "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel performance subsystem could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel," Google warns. Android's much maligned media server didn't escape the October update unscathed either. Android's media server and related libraries have been under scrutiny from security researchers since June 2015, when the first Stagefright flaw was revealed. In the new October update, there are five media server flaws rated as high severity (CVE-2016-3909, CVE-2016-3910, CVE-2016-3913 CVE-2016-3932 and CVE-2016-3933) and three rated as moderate (CVE-2016-3924, CVE-2016-3920 and CVE-2016-5696). While Qualcomm, upstream Linux and media server issues have been commonplace in Android updates, there are other issues that Google is addressing in the October update. Among the most noteworthy is CVE-2016-3908, which is a high severity issue in Android's lock setting service. "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in Lock Settings Service could enable a local malicious application to clear the device PIN or password," Google warns in its advisory. The CVE-2016-3908 issue was reported to Google by security researcher Zhanpeng Zhao from Cheetah Mobile. The ability to bypass a lock screen has become a hot topic of late, particularly on Apple's iOS. Sean Michael Kerner is a senior editor at eWEEK and InternetNews.com.

At the heart of this is voice control and the ability to call up Assistant at any point using the common Google trigger phrase “OK, Google”. The only problem was, as this was being extensively demonstrated on-stage, people in the audience and watching the live stream were finding their own Google products spark into life.

Google was less clear about how Assistant differs from Google Now, or Now On Tap, or Google’s voice commands. To clear things up, here are some of Assistant’s best new features, and how it fits into your Google life. Right now, the only way to try out Assistant is as a chatbot in Google Allo. Google also announced some features that won’t arrive until devices like Google Home or the Pixel phone arrive. Not every feature is available on every device, but there’s a lot of promising stuff on the way. A Screenshot Tour of Allo, Google's New Smart Messaging App A Screenshot Tour of Allo, Google's New Smart Messaging App A Screenshot Tour of Allo, Google's New Smart… Google just launched Allo, a new smart messaging app that comes with stickers, emoji, and a… Read more Read more Control Google Cast and Other Devices With Voice Commands If you own an Amazon Echo, controlling your lights or thermostat with a voice command may not seem all that new. However, Google Assistant brings the Chromecast, and any other Google Cast-enabled devices, into the fold. With Assistant, you’ll be able to say “Play Luke Cage,” for example. Google will automatically figure out that you want to play the show Luke Cage, through the app Netflix, on the Chromecast that’s on your Wi-Fi network. Advertisement Advertisement It’s unclear just yet how this will work if you have multiple Google Cast devices. So far, we know this feature will be enabled in Google Home, but hopefully it will at least come to the Pixel phone as well. Google Assistant will also be able to control smart home devices like those from Nest, Samsung SmartThings, and Philips Hue. Those are just the partners that Google announced at launch, but presumably more will follow. Once again, it’s unclear if Google will let you control these devices from your phone, or just the Google Home speaker, but both would be amazing.

It’s not… Read more Read more Have Complex Conversations with Follow Up Questions Google touts the ability to “have a conversation” with Google Assistant, like all anyone wants is a deeper relationship with their phone. However, when you actually use it, it becomes clear just how much better being able to ask follow up questions makes the experience. To demonstrate this, I tried out one of Google’s favorite examples that I never actually use: finding movie showtimes. Sponsored If I already know what movie I want to watch, I can just search whatever app I’m going to use to find tickets directly. Google’s useless to me here. However, if I’m curious what’s out, I can ask Assistant “What’s playing?” In Allo, this shows me a list of movies playing in my area. The Magnificent Seven looks okay. I tap it to get some information and reviews. I decide it’s worth a shot, so I go back to my Allo conversation and say “Showtimes” to find out where it’s playing near me. Except it only shows me the theaters closest to me. I prefer another AMC that’s about halfway between me and my friends. So I ask again, “Showtimes at Parkway Pointe.” Though I’m now several commands into this conversation and even left the app for a bit, Google still knows I’m asking about The Magnificent Seven. In fact, the only flaw left with the system is that Google will only offer to let me order tickets through Fandango (which we’ll come back to). Previously, you had to have a pretty good idea of what you wanted to find for a lot of Google’s cooler features to really be useful. Now that you can ask follow up questions and have a real conversation, a lot of queries will get a lot easier. Subscriptions Let You Get Reminders and Alerts About Anything As Often As You Want Google Now can already guess that you might want to see the weather and maybe a few stock prices every day. With Google Assistant, you can get that kind of recurring information for anything by following up a search with “send me daily.” Want a daily update with all the presidential news? You got it. Need to know the current exchange rate between US dollars and British pounds every morning? Google Assistant can totally do that. Advertisement Advertisement When I say “anything” I really mean anything. In Google Allo, I asked Assistant “How tall is Jeff Goldblum?” To which it naturally replied “Six feet four inches.” I then set up a subscription for that request to occur every morning at 7AM. This morning, I got a notification from Allo letting me know that, indeed, Jeff Goldblum is still six feet four inches tall. Presumably, this implies Google will let you set a subscription for nearly anything. We’ll see just how complex those scheduled commands can be when Assistant breaks out of Allo later this year. It’s possible that in the near future, you’ll be able to schedule a request for a cab every morning, or mute your phone every night simply by setting up a “subscription” to certain Google Assistant commands. Send Commands Offline and Get An Answer Later When you lose your internet connection, Google’s voice commands suddenly become useless. Google can’t even transcribe your commands, much less find out how tall Jeff Goldblum is. Assistant, on the other hand, will be able to save your commands and send them when you get your connection back. This works best in Allo where you can type your commands, since most voice transcription doesn’t work without an internet connection. Simply type your command and the next time you have a connection, you’ll get your answer. If you leave the app, Allo will even push a notification to let you know that it reconnected and it found your answer. This can be super handy when you need to set a reminder on the subway before you forget, for example. Some Google voice commands already work without an internet connection, so this isn’t totally new, but it’s a nice safety net to have when your connection gets fussy. Use Some Google Now Voice Commands Without an Internet Connection Use Some Google Now Voice Commands Without an Internet Connection Use Some Google Now Voice Commands Without an… Android: Google’s voice commands are pretty amazing. The one catch is that you need an internet… Read more Read more Google Assistant Will Support Third Party Services Google Search has a strange relationship with third-parties. You can get information from Wikipedia, IMDb, Fandango, and a million other services, but you can’t always interact with them. For example, if you ask Google to call you a cab now, it will give you links to Uber and Lyft, but it can’t get you a ride directly. That will change in December when Google launches its Actions on Google platform. Advertisement This platform will let third-parties add voice actions to Google Assistant. These can either be “direct actions” which are simple requests like “How tall is Jeff Goldblum?” or complex, conversational ones. Google demonstrated this yesterday by showing how hailing an Uber would work. You can simply say “I need an Uber,” Google will connect you to the Uber chatbot which asks you where you’re headed, you give it an address, pick what type of cab you need, and Uber will handle the rest. Since these will be built on Google Assistant, instead of just on one device, they’ll be able to adapt to whatever device you’re using. You can tap suggested replies to Assistant in Allo, or you can speak your commands to Google Home. As we stated before, you can also pause your conversations and come back to them later. Say you’ve already told Uber where you need to be picked up, but you need to ask your party if you need an UberX or an Uber XL. Google will wait while you figure it out. No more trying to memorize a long, complicated voice command to get it in one go. One of Assistant’s accidental best features is that the Google Now name is essentially dead. While the company hasn’t exactly given a straight answer about how Google Now will live on after Assistant rolls out, Android Police discovered that virtually every reference to Google Now and Google Now On Tap have been removed in the latest Google beta. Which is fine by us, since Google Now was an awful name to begin with that’s only gotten more confusing over time. Assistant makes much more sense as an umbrella term for the company’s smart features. Eric Ravenscraft eric@lifehacker.com @lordravenscraft Senior Writer for Lifehacker.

Google Wifi follows on from last year's OnHub router. It has an unobtrusive design that optimises signal strength and an intuitive mobile management interface. Google Wifi was announced alongside the company's new Pixel and Pixel XL phones, Daydream View VR headset and Google Home smart speaker yesterday. As part of Google's "Made by Google" campaign, Wifi is one of the first hardware products from the company to be designed and built entirely in-house. Last year, Google launched OnHub, a home-oriented Wi-Fi router focused on design and simplicity. Wi-Fi routers are used by billions of people to get online from mobile devices. They have a negative image associated with them though. The majority of consumers use poorly-built routers supplied by their service provider, offering mediocre signal strength and a confusing configuration site. OnHub sought to change that, creating an elegant router that’s easy to use. Google Wifi is the next step in the company's mission. This time around, Google is focusing on further increasing the signal strength of the router. The chassis design amplifies the emitted signals, enabling them to penetrate further through walls and travel for longer distances. This helps to eliminate Wi-Fi dead zones in your home. Google Wifi Google Google has also improved the handling of high-bandwidth activities. Google Wifi is resilient to demanding workloads, such as simultaneously managing streaming video from one user and online gaming by another. The system can easily be expanded with additional routers, enabling you to spread strong and fast Wi-Fi across the rooms of your home. "Most of us get Wi-Fi in our homes through a centralized router, but using a single router to spread signal throughout your whole home is like expecting one light bulb to light up every room," said Google. "Walls and distance make it difficult for a single device to send a strong signal to every corner of your home, resulting in slow Wi-Fi and dead zones." Google Wifi is able to take responsibility for its own management, helping home users who aren’t particularly technically savvy. Its built-in Network Assist technology runs automatically behind the scenes, intelligently choosing the best Wi-Fi channel and band for your device. As you go to different rooms in your home, Network Assist will seamlessly transition your connection to the closest router, helping you stay online and avoid network drop-outs. Google Wifi Google Google has replaced the clunky web interface of typical Wi-Fi routers with an easy-to-use mobile app. It enables you to take more control over the router's operation within a minimal interface. You can view the number of connected devices, how much bandwidth each is using and whether router updates are available. There's also robust parental management tools that let you temporarily disconnect devices, set access rules or prioritise network traffic to different devices. This allows you to prevent one user from consuming all the bandwidth. Google Wifi will be available to pre-order in the U.S. from November. It will retail at $129, a reasonable price for a high-end router. More traditional offerings are available for considerably less though. Google hopes that Wifi's ease of use and unobtrusive design will make it popular with consumers. Three-packs of devices will be offered for $299, letting you cover your home with dependable Wi-Fi.

Camera Comparisons Between Phones By Alexandra Suarez On 10/05/16 AT 12:53 PM Close Google made its big play in the world of smartphones when it debuted its Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones Tuesday. Tech outlets have already compared them to the top smartphones on the market now, including Apple’s iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7. The features and capabilities – from the design to going “under the hood” – have been the subject of exhaustive analysis. With the debut of each of the three phones, one of the hottest common topics has been their cameras. And on the heels of Pixel launch, many outlets have reported that the capabilities of Google’s cameras are well-matched to that of the Galaxy S7 and the new iPhone 7. The Galaxy and iPhone feature 12MP cameras while Pixel offers 12.3 MP, and all three models are pushing cameras that capture enviable images in low light. In addition, when it comes to video, both Pixel models, the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 all boast 4K video, USA Today pointed out in its review. As customers await the retail arrival of Google Pixel and Pixel XL (models are expected to go on sale Oct. 20, but preorders have begun for Verizon subscribers), the facts speak for themselves when comparing the capabilities of each phone’s camera. Here is a breakdown of what the cameras on Apple’s iPhone 7, Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Google’s Pixel are packing: Galaxy S7: “The best camera just got better.” - Dual Pixel Technology. - 5 MP front-facing camera. - 4K video. - 12 MP camera. - F1.7 lens. iPhone 7: “An entirely new camera enters the picture.” - F/1.8 aperture and six-element lens. - Quad-LED True Tone Flash. - 12 MP. - 4K video. - 7 MP front-facing camera.

Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « Why Engaging Fans Via Facebook Messenger Now Is Like Being The First Musician On YouTube | Main | Two Words That Will Boost Your Digital Strategy » Big Tech Files Mass NOIs To Avoid Paying Statutory Royalties In Latest Artist Relations Debacle [Chris Castle] In an ongoing saga of failures to ingratiate themselves with music business creatives, it seem big tech companies such as Google have recently been exploiting a loophole in the Copyright Act relating to compulsory licenses in order to avoid paying proper royalties to songwriters, writes Chris Castle. __________________________ Guest Post by Chris Castle on Music Tech Solutions As we saw in parts 1 and 2 of this post, New Boss companies like Google are playing on a loophole in the Copyright Act’s compulsory license for songs to shirk responsibility for song licensing from the songwriters or other copyright owners, get out of paying royalties and stop songwriters from auditing. Not only have Google targeted long tail titles, but also new releases and songs by ex-US songwriters who are protected by international treaties.  This is exactly the kind of rent seeking behavior by crony capitalists that gives Big Tech a bad name in the music community. Google are doing this on a grand scale and at great expense, reportedly using “millions” of “address unknown” NOI filings with the Copyright Office that are supposed to be reserved for bona fide situations where the copyright owner cannot be found after a reasonably diligent search.  Amazon is doing the same. Through a quirk in the law (which needs to be fixed pronto) Google and Amazon are paying astonishing sums in filing fees to send the “address unknown” NOIs to the Copyright Office for songs that have not been registered for U.S. copyright or otherwise recorded with the Copyright Office.  “Address unknown” NOIs are intended to be used when you really can’t find the address of the copyright owner after a diligent search of relevant records, although the Copyright Act limits the search to the public records of the Copyright Office.  That limitation on records to be searched is a legacy echo from the 1909 revision of the Copyright Act which required registration and renewal for copyright to attach in the U.S. So far, the overwhelming majority of “address unknown” NOIs are filed by Google.  Spot checking the Amazon filings shows that Amazon filed a handful of titles. Google apparently accomplishes this by manipulating a data dump from the Library of Congress that was never designed for filing mass NOIs and comparing the metadata in the data dump song title to their own list of sound recording titles that they want to exploit on their services. Moral Hazard Revisited, DMCA Style If you have a recording you want to use, you need to clear the song.  You take that song title from the recording and look it up in the Library of Congress data dump.  If it’s not there, you file the “address unknown” NOI.  Wash, rinse, repeat 1,000,000 times or more. See how that works? As if by magic, you don’t have to pay mechanical royalties until the songwriter figures out what you have done by checking the NOI submissions page at the Copyright Office (assuming anyone knows it’s there or knows their song might be listed) and then…does what? Note that “1 NOI” means “1 NOI with tens of thousands of songs attached in an Excel file” This approach is fraught with moral hazard for largely the same reasons that plague the DMCA safe harbor–the party who benefits from avoiding both royalties and copyright infringement liability by sending the “address unknown” NOI is also the party who decides whether they qualify for the “address unknown” NOI.  The Copyright Office clearly lacks the resources to cross check.  Sounds kind of like DMCA notices, right? The excuse the services  give for this approach is that they can’t find the copyright owner for “long tail” and new releases. The long tail part you can understand, but of course you have to ask yourself if a title is so obscure that you can’t find the song copyright owner, then why use it at all?  Holding a track off of a service is far more likely to get the songwriter to come forward than sneaking around through the back door. The New Release Scam Illustrated It’s with new releases that Google runs the true arbitrage play.  This is the part that makes no sense, particularly for songs written or owned by people with whom Google does repeat business.  By relying on the “address unknown” NOI filings for new releases, even for songs that may be subject to a direct license, Google is using a loophole to appropriate value to themselves that should rightly go to the songwriters. Let’s take another Sting example. Sting released the song “50,000”, apparently as a single from his new 57th & 9thLP.  “50,000” is an introspective Sting-style tribute to David Bowie and Prince.  The album release date was September 23, 2016 and the single debuted around September 17.  Google must have gotten the track around the same time as it is listed in Google’s September 16, 2016 mass NOI filing on line 626. “50,000” is a particularly good example of how bogus Google’s approach is to “address unknown” NOIs.  Google’s basis for filing the NOI on “50,000” apparently is that “50,000” is not included in either a copyright registration or other recording in the public records of the Copyright Office at the moment that Google looked for it.  What this evidently means is that “50,000” wasn’t in the Library of Congress data dump sometime prior to September 16 when Google filed its mass NOI. It is important to remember that there is no requirement for anyone to register their works or otherwise record their works in order to enjoy the rights of a copyright owner–such as mechanical royalties.  This is true under international copyright law, not just in the U.S., so this quirk in U.S. copyright law is probably illegal and possibly unenforceable  (which is why the “address unknown” NOI filing needs to be amended or eliminated–more about that below). So simply put–how can you take away rights from a copyright owner based on a registration requirement that the copyright owner is not required to comply with because it is a formality that is actually prohibited by law?  Sound Kafka-esque to you?  It does to me. In Sting’s case, Google knows who Sting is.  They have other songs by Sting for which they probably sent an NOI.  They may even have a direct license with Sting’s publisher that may actually supersede or be in lieu of a statutory license.  In other words–they very well may have actual knowledge of Sting’s publisher.  Wouldn’t that be a good place to start? Yet because a new release has not yet shown up in the Copyright Office records, Google sends an NOI and will not be required to pay royalties until–if ever–the song is included in the Library of Congress data dump.  Even though Sting is not required to register the song, Sting’s publisher may decide to register the copyright in order to take advantage of statutory damages and attorneys fees for infringement actions. Getting a conformed copy of a copyright registration can take months–so for a single or an album, any mechanical royalties from Google under a statutory license during the new release window will never be paid.  And if any direct license does not expressly prohibit including titles in mass NOIs, there’s a good chance no new release will get mechanical royalties from Google. What Is To Be Done? So now we know what the problem is, how to stop it?  Not so easy to do. 1. Anticompetitive:  It should not be lost on anyone that the government has created an opportunity for companies with market power to use their leverage to the disadvantage of their competitors as well as songwriters.  It takes considerable capital to pay the filing fees  to the Copyright Office and purchase data from the Library of Congress in order to arbitrage this loophole. 2. Take Down the Recordings:  There are any one of a number of ways that the terms of a typical interactive music service license can be interpreted to allow the sound recording owner to pull recordings by at least current roster artists, especially new releases written by artist/songwriters (including co-writes) who complain to their labels. 3.  Take Down the Songs:  Direct licenses from music publishers presumably have some clause that will allow the publishers to stop mass NOI filings for their catalog, particularly of the type that creates a nonexistent distinction between versions of a song that have been retititled–not by the songwriter or publisher but by the artist or record company because the versions of the recording are different even though the song remains the same. 4.  Counterfeits or Bootlegs (including stream rips):  Statutory licenses are only available for sound recordings distributed under the authority of the copyright owner.  There are a number of NOIs that look suspiciously like bootlegs or counterfeits, some of which may have been stream ripped.  As Google is presumably sending NOIs for YouTube Red or other on-demand service. 5.  Congressional Investigation to Stop the Library of Congress Selling Data for NOIs:  The LOC has no business selling what is obviously incomplete data or misleading data to a user who so obviously is using it for a harmful purpose.  The LOC could stop that immediately if they were so instructed by the Congress, and in any event the Congress should investigate. 6. Use Webform to Update or File Your Address Including Excel File Link:  The Copyright Office has a webform for email contact by the public available here.  You can use this to file your address and link to your catalog in an Excel file (hosted on your website or blog).  Such correspondence is likely subject to FOIA (and therefore part of the public records of the Copyright Office), but you can also state in your webform that you are submitting the information with the intention that it become public and demand that your information be provided to anyone submitting a mass NOI as part of the LOC data dump. The point that seems to have escaped Google and Amazon is that this loophole will surely be stopped, but what won’t be stopped is the complete lack of moral compass that would drive megacorporations to run roughshod over songwriters that they so aptly demonstrate.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Many Android 7.1 features are Pixel-exclusive, and Nexuses can’t get it yet It may be a few months before Google's older devices see the update. by Andrew Cunningham - Oct 5, 2016 4:29 pm UTC Login to bookmark 155 Enlarge / The Google Assistant is just one of several new features that will be Pixel-exclusive, at least for now. Ron Amadeo Google quietly announced Android 7.1 alongside its new Pixel phones yesterday, but it wasn't immediately clear which of the new Android features were specific to Google's phones and which would be available to other Android phones. The full list of Pixel-specific enhancements is a mix of hardware-specific stuff and Google's software and services: Pixel Launcher—swipe up for all apps, new Search Box, date/weather header on home Google Assistant Unlimited original quality photo/video backup to Google Photos Smart Storage—when storage is full, automatically removes old backed up photos/videos Phone/Chat support (new support tab in settings), screen-share functionality Quick switch adapter for wired setup from Android or iPhone Pixel Camera: Electronic Image Stabilization (“video stabilization”) 2.0 Pro Features White Balance Presets Exposure Compensation AE/AF Locking Viewfinder grid modes HW-accelerated (on Qualcomm Hexagon coprocessor) HDR+ image processing Smartburst Sensor Hub processor with tightly integrated sensors (accel, gyro, mag) + connectivity (Wi-Fi, Cell, GPS) Cosmetic Solid navbar icons with home affordance for Assistant SysUI accent color theming Wallpaper picker with new wallpapers and sounds New setup look and feel Dynamic calendar date icon Some of these things may eventually make it to other Android phones—the Pixel launcher, the Google Assistant, and some of the UI stuff. Others, like the phone and chat support features and the unlimited storage of photos and video, could come to other phones but are more likely to remain Google-exclusive to add value to the Pixels. The list of features available to other phones, including older Nexus and Pixel devices that eventually get Android 7.1, is a smaller but still respectable collection of improvements. It's a minor update in the vein of Android 4.3 or 5.1, and it's probably representative of what we can expect from Android's quarterly updates going forward. Night Light (this shifts the color temperature of your screen a la iOS' Night Shift mode or f.lux) Touch/display performance improvements Moves (Fingerprint swipe-down gesture—opt-in) Seamless A/B system updates Daydream VR mode Developer features: App shortcuts/shortcut manager APIs Circular app icons support Keyboard image insertion Fingerprint sensor gesture to open/close notification shade Manual storage manager Intent for apps Improved VR thread scheduling Enhanced wallpaper metadata Multi-endpoint call support Support for various MNO requirements PCDMA voice privacy property Source type support for Visual Voicemail Carrier config options for managing video telephony Manual storage manager - identifies apps and files and apps using storage Android Police reports that Android 7.1 will be released as a developer preview for some older Nexus and Pixel devices by the end of the year, but we don't know which ones just yet—Android 7.0 runs on the Nexus 6P, 5X, 6, and 9 as well as the Nexus Player and Pixel C, but Google technically doesn't have to keep providing version updates to the Nexus 6 or 9 after this month. It's not clear why the software that will ship on the Pixel phones is still only "beta" quality when running on any other phone, and it's too bad that Google's older devices won't get the update as promptly as they have in the past, but it's going to happen eventually. We also have no idea when Android 7.1 will be available to any of Google's hardware partners, many of which are still getting around to announcing their update plans for 7.0. I'm still hoping that Google has an answer to the update question that it just isn't ready to tell us yet, especially since Android updates are going to be coming out more frequently than ever. At least for now, however, the only way to make sure you've always got the newest and best software is to shell out $650 or more for a brand-new phone directly from Google.

This week, though, the Internet giant said they would waive his exorbitant bill after realising the 12-year-old made a costly "mistake." In August, Jose Javier from the southeastern seaside city of Torrevieja created an account with AdWords, a Google pay-per-click service that allows ads to show up above search results and on other sites. The customer gives his or her credit card details, and only pays when someone clicks on the link. But Javier -- whose parents had opened a savings account in his name -- gave his banking details thinking he was actually going to earn money from ads on his homemade website. The company realises that "it was all a mistake and that he did it without thinking," a Google spokeswoman said Wednesday. "A 12-year-old boy doesn't want to start spending 100,000 euros." In a statement, the company added it would waive the boy's debt. His mother Inma Quesada told the El Pais daily that her son "wanted to buy instruments" for his band Los Salerosos (loosely translated as "The Salties"), in which he plays the trumpet. His parents were alerted to the fact that he was racking up debt when the bank called them to warn them about the charges.

But if you really stop to think about them, none of them are original. They are just Google’s own versions of other top-selling products. Google copied Apple’s iPhone 7, Amazon’s Echo, Eero’s router, and it came out with a VR headset that many companies already make. So why is Google just copying every single hot gadget in town? Because the best new product Google showed off on Tuesday wasn’t something you can touch. DON’T MISS: Meet the Google Pixel XL phablet: Release date, pricing and specs Google did try to make hardware products before, but it consistently failed to come up with any real winners. The Nexus phones were never top sellers. Google Glass never made it past beta. Motorola, which actually had a full-fledged hardware division already, was quickly dumped. And even the Nest acquisition didn’t go smoothly. Sure, products like the Chromecast are proof that Google has what it takes to make it in the hardware business. But Google never really seemed interested in doing a better job at hardware. google-homeMore So why is Google reinventing its hardware division? And why is it copying rival products rather than coming up with brand new gadgets? When Google created Android — or when it acquired and redesigned the mobile operating system — it did so out of fear. Google saw the future and realized that a world where desktops would be replaced by powerful pocket computers might destroy its search business. So it came up with a way to preserve its search dominance. A free Android operating system would be a viable alternative to Windows Mobile, BlackBerry, Symbian and iOS. It turns out that Google was correct and Android is now the dominant mobile OS. And most Android devices are packed full of Google services that earn money. google-wi-fi-home-2More Now, Google is again peering into the future and preparing for things to come. Tiny devices we keep in our pockets will be able to understand how we interact with them, predict our needs and help out. They're also going to be powerful entertainment devices, ready to deliver all sorts of digital content every step of the way. Google’s Assistant is undoubtedly the best product Google unveiled this week. But Google Assistant needs a place to call home — pun intended. And Google needs to make sure that the tiny computers of the future that can run Google’s Assistant won’t just br products from the competition. Why? Because those products will have assistants of their own. So Google needs an iPhone. It needs an Echo. It needs an Eero to make sure its iPhone and Echo are always connected to the internet. It needs a PlayStation/Oculus/Vive VR alternative, and it needs a better Chromecast to stay ahead of the curve. daydream1More Sure, one could argue that Assistant and Daydream can run on any Android device. But that’s not really the case. Recognizing and processing voice requests is a task that not all smartphones and tablets will support. And the same goes for VR. Not even the most recent Nexus handsets will get Assistant or Daydream, let alone older Android phones from other companies. Read More So Google has to dive into hardware more than ever. It has to make Pixels, Homes and routers, so that in the future its advertising revenue isn’t killed. No, we won’t stop searching the web in coming years. Weather in actual reality or VR, we’re going to look for answers all the time. And we’re going to do it by voice far more frequently. Google definitely wants us to search using Pixels or Home devices rather than iPhones, Galaxy phones, Echos or consoles.

Apple and LG previously challenged the Note 5 successor by releasing the iPhone 7 Plus and V20, respectively. Now, it’s Google’s turn to confront the Note 7 with its all-new phablet device, the Pixel XL. Without further ado, here’s a comparison review of the Pixel XL and the Galaxy Note 7 specs and features.  Performance When it was launched in August, Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 made headlines for being a powerhouse with innovative features. It came with a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip, which is composed of two Kryo cores clocked at 2.15 GHz and two more Kryo cores clocked at 1.6 GHz. The handset also came with an Adreno 530 GPU that all the more made it impressive in terms of performance. Its benchmark results were remarkable, with Android Central reporting a day after the Note 7’s release that it scored high in the AnTuTu 6 benchmark and the GFXBench tests.  On the other hand, the Google Pixel XL comes with Qualcomm’s latest chipset, the Snapdragon 821, comprising two Kryo cores clocked at 2.15 GHz and two more Kryo cores clocked at 1.6 GHz. Though the configurations of the cores are the same with those of the Note 7, Qualcomm indicated on its official website that the 821 is 10 percent better than the 820. Thus, it’s safe to say that Google’s phablet has the upper hand in this round, since it comes with the more powerful processor and the same Adreno 530 GPU that’s responsible for seamless graphics performance and compute capabilities.  Display Display-wise, Samsung is proud with what it has done to its Note 5 successor. The 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display of the Note 7 has a 1440x2560 screen resolution and 518 ppi pixel density. The Note 7’s display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which per Corning is so much tougher and provides resistance to damage even when the device falls 1.6 meters onto a hard, rough surface. Making the Samsung phablet’s display even more interesting is its Always-on feature that allows users to check time, date, missed class and message alerts with ease as there is no need to unlock the device to view all these.  The Pixel XL’s display is actually a pretty good match for the Note 7’s high-end screen. For one thing, the 5.5-inch AMOLED display also sports 1440x2560 screen resolution and it even outnumbers the ppi of the Note 7 with its 534 pixel density, based on PhoneArena's report. Moreover, the number of colors it can render also equals the 16,777,216 colors the Note 7 display has. The only downside here is the fact that Google’s phablet comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection instead of the up-to-date Gorilla Glass 5 found in the Note 7. It is also worth noting that the Pixel XL does not have an Always-on feature, since it is solely running on Android Nougat v7.1, unlike Samsung’s phablet that has TouchWiz UI running on top of the latest Android mobile OS available to it. Camera Technology Samsung did not really bank on camera technology for its Galaxy Note 7, but the South Korea tech giant did come up with a decent pair of front and back cameras for its phablet. Its back camera has a 12-megapixel sensor with f/1.7 aperture, standard LED flash, phase detection autofocus, optical image stabilization and a couple of software features to enhance its functionality. Its camcorder is capable of taking 4K videos at 30fps. Up front, the Note 7 features a decent 5-megapixel snapper with f/1.7 aperture, auto HDR and dual video call functionality. Despite claiming that its Note 7’s cameras deliver quality photography, it is pretty clear that they are nowhere near as impressive as the cameras of its rivals. On paper, the Google Pixel XL’s cameras are also very remarkable. The primary snapper has a 12.3-megapixel sensor with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection and laser autofocus, as well as dual-LED (dual tone) flash, according to GSM Arena. It does have optical image stabilization and software features such as digital zoom and geo-tagging. Its camcorder is also capable of capturing 4K videos at 30fps. Meanwhile, its secondary camera on the front has an 8-megapixel sensor and is capable of taking 1080p videos at 30fps. At this point, it is still too early to tell whether or not Google Pixel XL’s cameras provide better quality photos than the Note 7 since Google’s phablet is not arriving on the market until Oct. 13.  Related Stories Apple iPhone 7 vs. Google Pixel - Which Is Better? Google Pixel Leaks Keep Coming The Better One Between iPhone 7 Plus Vs. Galaxy Note 7 Miscellaneous  Other features that make the Galaxy Note 7 stand out from the Google Pixel XL include the IP68 certification of its water-proof and dust-proof body. It has a fingerprint scanner and an iris scanner, and it also comes with its signature S-Pen stylus. The Note 7 also has support for Samsung Pay, the tech giant’s mobile payments service. Additionally, the phablet comes in three color variants: Blue Coral, Black Onyx and Silver Titanium. It has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage with expandable memory via the microSD card slot. Finally, powering the handset is a non-removable Li-ion 3500 mAh battery with wireless charging support. Contrariwise, the Pixel XL does not have an iris scanner, but it does come with a fingerprint scanner for advanced biometrics verification. It is not water-resistant and does not have a stylus. It comes with the latest Android Nougat v7.1 OS and built-in support for Google’s AI assistant called Google Assistant. It has three color options: Really Blue, Quite Silver and Very Black. The Pixel XL has 4GB of RAM, and it comes in two internal memory variants — 32GB and 128GB. Sadly, it does not have a microSD card slot for memory expansion. Last but not the least, the device houses a non-removable Li-ion 3450 mAh battery. Per Android Central, pricing for the Pixel XL starts at $769, which is more affordable than the $849.99 base price of the Note 7.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Google Introduces Pixel the Smartphone and other Hardware Devices Squarely Aimed at Amazon and Samsung | Main | On this Day we Respectfully Remember Steve Jobs » October 05, 2016 The Google Manifesto: The Arrival of the AI Revolution   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Google Introduces Pixel the Smartphone and other Hardware Devices Squarely Aimed at Amazon and Samsung." The report was a simple peek at Google's newly released hardware products covering their all-new new Pixel smartphone, Google Home, Google Wifi and more. Closing out that report I touched on Artificial Intelligence because a Gartner analyst speaking to the Guardian about the Google event was saying that Apple was late to market with AI and that Apple was quickly dropping behind Amazon and Google. It was the same false argument made by a Forbes contributor months ago. This is the narrative that Google is engineering when talking to journalists. It's the propaganda that they want consumers to hear about to put Apple in the rear view mirror of the AI revolution. Remember that Apple and Steve Jobs was at the forefront of the personal computing revolution and that they were also at the forefront of the mobille revolution with the iPhone and iPad. So hell if Google wants Apple to lead the next revolution regarding AI. So yesterday Google took off the gloves and simply decided to take up the AI mantle.   In yesterday's report I tried to be diplomatic in wishing Google all the best in their venture, especially if they could challenge Samsung's product line. But Business Insider's writer Mat Rosoff didn't hold back in slamming Google's big splash last night by saying that Google is a follower not a leader and hit them on every front imaginable.   But just don't say that to Google's CEO Sundar Pichai's face because he sees things much differently. In fact, forget yesterday's new product launches. If you focus on that you missed the boat entirely. Yesterday's event was really about delivering Google's manifesto. The AI revolution is the next wave or the next phase in computing and Google was at the forefront. They were leading it and that was the end of that discussion.   When Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, it truly was a moment in time that marked the beginning of the true mobile revolution with true smartphones, modern apps and the internet in your pocket.   Yesterday, Google's CEO tried to seize that moment in time for Google. A moment in time where they were bringing the next revolution to the public: The AI Revolution.   Whether we'll look back and see that moment of the event in that light only time will tell. But make no mistake about it – Google's CEO was basically making that claim. He believed this was Google's shining moment, because to date, no one, not even Apple was ready to make such a claim.   To mark this moment. Patently Apple has transcribed about 90% of Pichai's keynote so that it's on record and quotable for future reports. This is what Pichai stated:   Google's CEO Keynote on the AI Revolution   "We're at a seminal moment in computing. If you step back and think about it, computing has always had big shifts every ten years or so. It all started in the eighties when the personal computer reached the mainstream. It was the first time that computing touched the lives of many people and revolutionized the way they worked.   Roughly a decade later, in the mid-nineties, the Web arrived. It is arguably the biggest platform shift that we've seen in our lifetime. It brought the internet to many more people, radically changing the streets (?), fundamentally changed the way people interact and connect with each other.   About ten years later, in the mid-2000's, with the advent of smartphones, we had the mobile revolution. That brought computing to about half the world's population – and it's profoundly changing people's lives; and the shift continues.   In fact, when I look ahead at where computing is headed, it's clear to me that we're heading, evolving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world.   What do I mean by that? In this world computing will be universally available, it will be everywhere in the context of a user's daily life. People will be able to interact with it naturally and seamlessly than ever before. And above all else, it will be intelligent. It will help users in more meaningful ways.   At Google, we're very, very excited about this shift and we've been working for a long time towards this shift. At the heart of these efforts, is our goal to build a Google Assistant.   We've spoken about Google Assistant earlier at Google I/O this year. The vision to our Assistant as a two-way conversation, a natural dialogue between our users and Google to help them get things done in the real world. The Assistant will be universal, it'll be available when the user's need it to help them. And our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user. Just like we built a Google for everyone, we want to build each user his or her own individual Google. To capture our vision for what the Google Assistant is, we put together a short video [noted below], let's take a look."     So as you can see that's an early vision of how we want to build a Google Assistant. We're just getting started but in many ways we been working hard to solve this problem ever since Google was founded 18 years ago. We've invested in deep layers of computer science. Today, our knowledge graph has over 70 billion facts about people, places and things [a tag which was firsts used by Apple/IBM regarding Taligent's "People, Places and Things], and we can answer questions based on that.   Our natural language processing is what helps us make Google truly conversational with our users and we've built state of the art machine translation, image recognition and voice recognition systems and each of these areas is being turbo charged by the progress that we're seeing with machine learning in AI.   A few months ago we captured the World's attention when DeepMinds AlphaGo won the world's 'Go' championship against [South Korea's] Lee Sedol, one of the finest players of our generation. It showed the external world that the moment for AI had arrived. But for us, the progress has been continuous and the strides are huge. In fact, in the three months since AlphGo played that game, we've had meaningful launches and how machine learning is impacting the products we build.   Let me talk about three examples, all of which we've talked about in the past three months since the AlphaGo moment. First, 'Image Captioning." Image Captioning is how computers try to make sense of images they look at. And we first launched our machine learning system in 2014, a state of the art sytem, and our quality was around over 89%. Our newer machine learning systems now the quality is now close to 94%. Four percent may not sound like much to you but first it's really hard to increase quality at these levels because we're trying to approach human level accuracy.   And Second, every single percentage point translates into meaningful difference for our users. So for example if you take a look at the picture behind me [see above] – about two years ago we use to understand this picture as 'a train is sitting on the tracks." Now, we understand the colors so we describe it as 'A blue and yellow train traveling down train tracks.'   Or if you look at this picture [below], two years ago we use to understood this picture as 'A brown bear is swimming in the water.' Now, we can count, the computing system can count, so we understand this as 'Two brown bears sitting on the top of rocks.'   Advances like this is what helps us when you're in Google Photos find the exact pictures that you're looking for and be a better Assistant for you.   Another example, machine translation. We've been doing machine translation for a while and historically, our systems are statistics based, and we translate at a phrase by phrase level. So we translate individual phrases and combine them to form a translation. So if you look at this Chinese to English translation, you can see it makes sense but it's not quite the way humans would translate it. Just recently we've just announced our first end-to-end self-learning, deep learning translation systems.   Rather than working at a phrase level, they take entire sentences and models sentence outputs; and that's what you see in the middle. And you can see it is approaching human level translation. You can look at this qauntitatively, and if you look at our previous phrase based system, it was quite far from the human system and we've closed a significant gap with our new machine learning systems.   Google's CEO Sundar Pichai painstakingly drilled down into details about the progress or their AI and went on to talk about Text-to-Speech and how over time their AI will be able to understand various dialects within a country and to understand emotion and reflect that in translations and conversations with the Google Assistant in any language around the world.   Pichai then handed over the keynote to those presenting Google's new Pixel smartphone and Google Home which have Google Assistant at the heart of these products.   A Steve Jobs Moment in Time it was Not   In truth, the AI revolution really hasn't hit the market with any degree of success as of yet. Thus far it's all been super-hype in a bottle with gimmicks as thick and corny as Brylcreem ads of yesteryear. In fact, there isn't a single runaway product that we can point to today that has delivered on this promise that counts or has sparked the imagination of the public to rush out and buy it.   When Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs first introduced the iPad, it quickly racked up sales of over 100 million units. It was the fastest selling product in history. Has Amazon's Echo hit anything close to that yet? Of course not. Will the new 'Google Home' device hit that 100 million mark by this time next year? Don't' be ridiculous. Both will probably have the success that Apple did with their first Apple TV – Something that Apple simply called a hobby product.   At the end of the day, Google's CEO gave it his best shot – but a Steve Jobs moment in time it was not – even though he gave it his best shot. Apple has been working on a new Siri home product for years and there are patent filings proving that out. So it's not just Apple-speak, marketing voodoo or a fanboy's wishful thinking. So Apple has a lot of time to get on board with a new home product with Siri for every room. For now, Apple has just introduced their intelligent assistant Siri for macOS and already have it running soundly on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Where's Google Assistant? Right, it's just starting to roll out.   True, the AI revolution is coming. But sorry Pichai, as dramatic as you tried to make it, it didn't arrive yesterday during your keynote.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Alphabet's Google on Tuesday unveiled the Pixel and larger Pixel XL, the first phones that were conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. The Pixel handsets feature a Siri-like virtual assistant, flashy camera features and are the first to boast Android’s new Nougat 7.1 operating system. Their debut signals Google’s push into the $400 billion smartphone hardware business and shows that the company is willing to risk alienating partners like Samsung  and LG that sell Android-based phones. “Google is now the seller of record of this phone,” said Rick Osterloh, chief of the company’s new hardware division. He notes that the company is now managing inventory, building relationships with carriers, sourcing components, making supply chain deals and managing distribution. Google is even making accessories, including cases and cables. Until now, Google had satisfied itself with dipping a toe into the smartphone hardware business with the six-year-old Nexus program, a co-branding effort that outsourced the vast majority of development to other smartphone makers. While well regarded, Nexus handsets were mostly a way for Google to experiment. But along the way, executives began to see the benefit of the Apple approach: a unified portfolio of consumer electronics products that show off its services better than partners can. A Home speaker device, a virtual reality headset, a Wi-Fi router system and an updated video streaming stick were also unveiled on Tuesday at an event in San Francisco. Getting into the hardware business is a big, risky financial and operational commitment. But Google needed its own handset to ensure distribution for its web services, and more complex offerings like virtual and augmented reality. So in the summer of 2015, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai approved the Pixel project; development began last fall. “The difference with this device is that we started from the beginning,” says Dave Burke, who runs Android engineering. By contrast, Google’s contributions to Nexus phones typically didn’t happen until they were 90 percent done. Custom Silicon When Osterloh, 44, came on board in mid-April, he brought Google’s hardware groups into one division, shuttering projects he didn’t see contributing to Google’s future. Now the engineers and designers from Google Glass, Chromecast and Pixel all work together. Keeping them separate, he says, made it “hard to drive toward the goal of portfolio strategy and focus.” Reflecting long-held ambitions to build an Apple-style supply chain, the hardware division now has a supply-management team, drawing on the expertise of the Nest smart-home unit acquired by Google nearly three years ago. Google declined to say how much it’s spending on the effort. However, Jason Bremner, a former Qualcomm Inc. executive who works on Google’s hardware products, put it in context. "Part of being the seller of record means that inventory, that supply chain risk -- you know, hundreds of millions of dollars on the line on any given day -- that’s on Google now," he said. Now that Google is designing phones itself, the company can at long last put together a product roadmap going out several years. For example, last month Burke was able to see a photo taken by a Google handset that won’t debut until next fall. That “would have never happened with Nexus,” he says. Going forward, more and more of the phones’ guts will be developed in-house. Burke says the company will eventually be able to ship its own custom “silicon,” a buzzword for customized processors that make devices work better. It’s a very different setup from Osterloh’s previous Google gig, when he ran the Motorola division. “While we were part of Google, we were very arm’s-length,” he says. Now his team gets early access to the company’s advances in machine learning and innovations from the Assistant group. The Pixel phones will also be the first to run the next version of Android, Nougat 7.1, complete with Google tie-ins like pro camera effects, instant chat support, and a service that automatically frees up phone storage via the cloud. Still, Google has deliberately built a firewall between the hardware and Android divisions so other phone makers’ proprietary technology doesn’t leak. Hiroshi Lockheimer, who runs the Android unit and is a longtime Osterloh pal, says his group will treat the hardware team like any customer. “Samsung is a very important partner, as is LG, Huawei and so on,” he says. “Rick is an important partner. Samsung tells us confidential information about their product line, their plans. We won’t tell LG that, and vice versa. That continues. Everyone is treated the same, including Rick’s team.” Osterloh Show When Osterloh demonstrated the Pixel phones at Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters recently, it was immediately clear the craftsmanship is light years ahead of the flimsy $1,500 Google Glass headsets and plastic Chromecast media players of yore. With their metal frames and precisely honed bezels and edges, the Pixels (which come in silver, black and limited-edition blue) have more in common with the elegant gear from Nest. The phones feature cameras that can snap photos quicker than the blink of an eye, app speeds once reserved for laptops and battery life that bests last year’s non-Google made Nexus phones. Osterloh proudly showed how one can twist the phone mid-air to activate the selfie-camera. “That’s pretty cool,” he says. Also notable is a fingerprint scanner that doubles as a trackpad (other Android phone makers will get to enable this, too) and software-enhanced gyroscopes that reduce shakiness in recorded video, stabilization that Osterloh calls “out of this world good.” The new phones are made up of off-the-shelf components from several suppliers, including a Snapdragon processor, and are assembled in Taiwan by HTC. But there is still custom work inside this first version, including wireless modem technology that has evolved from earlier experiments with Nexus. The Pixel also has chipsets optimized by Google that makes photo-taking and touchscreen response times much faster than any Android device yet built, Burke says. The Google Assistant was developed separately from Android and offers suggestions based on previous queries. For example, it can list San Francisco landmarks after being asked earlier about the local weather. While Google has contracted HTC to assemble the Pixel phones, Osterloh says the approach is no different than Apple’s partnership with iPhone builder Foxconn. Flip the Pixel over and you’ll see “Made by Google,” another tip of the hat to Apple, which has long made much of the fact that its phones are “Designed by Apple in California.” Osterloh says Google will never say the Pixel is co-engineered with anyone else. He proudly proclaims, “It’s ours.” Google Pixel Rs.56,399 KEY SPECS NEWS Display5.00-inch Processor1.6GHz quad-core Front Camera8-megapixel Resolution1080x1920 pixels RAM4GB OSAndroid 7.1 Storage32GB Rear Camera12.3-megapixel Battery Capacity2770mAh Google Pixel, Pixel XL Available With Up to Rs. 26,000 Discount in Flipkart Exchange Offer Pixel, Pixel XL Aren't More Water Resistant Because Google Supposedly 'Ran Out of Time' Google Pixel and Pixel XL Will Start Shipping in India on October 25 Google Pixel Positive Reviews Take Alphabet Shares to Record High More Google mobilesGoogle mobiles price in India Google Pixel XL Rs.66,799 REVIEW KEY SPECS NEWS Design Display Software Performance Battery life Camera Value for money Good Brilliant low-light photography Fast modern processor Great battery life Google Assistant with localisations for India Bad Not very stylish or eye-catching Expensive No storage expansion Read detailed Google Pixel XL review Display5.50-inch Processor1.6GHz quad-core Front Camera8-megapixel Resolution1440x2560 pixels RAM4GB OSAndroid 7.1 Storage32GB Rear Camera12.3-megapixel Battery Capacity3450mAh Google Pixel, Pixel XL Available With Up to Rs. 26,000 Discount in Flipkart Exchange Offer Pixel, Pixel XL Aren't More Water Resistant Because Google Supposedly 'Ran Out of Time' Google Pixel and Pixel XL Will Start Shipping in India on October 25 Google Pixel Positive Reviews Take Alphabet Shares to Record High More Google mobilesGoogle mobiles price in India Tags: Google, Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Made by Google, Apple, IPhone, Mobiles, Android Google Wifi Router: All You Need to Know Daydream View: Google's New VR Headset for the Masses Behind the Pixel: Google's First Real Threat to the iPhone     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Vivo Xplay6 Vivo X9 Plus Vivo X9 Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Motorola Moto M Lyf F8 Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) General Mobile GM5 Xiaomi Redmi 4A Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Xiaomi Redmi 4 Micromax Canvas Spark 4G Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » Panasonic Eluga Turbo In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 13,999Rs. 7,999 Yu Yureka Plus In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 12,500Rs. 6,389 Micromax Canvas Juice 4G ...

Rick Osterloh, head of Google's new hardware group, said that in doing so, Google can take full advantage of capabilities it's designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long designed both iPhone hardware and the iOS operating-system software that runs on it. Now, Google is doing the same with the upcoming Pixel phones running Google's Android system. The Pixel is one of several gadgets Google announced Tuesday in San Francisco. New Phone, New Branding, New Marketing Google's previous phones, dubbed Nexus, had limited distribution. Now, the company is casting aside the Nexus name in favor of Pixel, a brand that Osterloh said has "always represented the best of hardware and software designed by Google." And instead of relying primarily on online orders, as was the case with Nexus, Google will offer Pixel through Verizon as well, starting Oct. 20. Advance orders began Tuesday starting at roughly $650 for the 5-inch version and $750 for the slightly larger 5.5-inch screen. Google will also make Pixel available at Best Buy and various wireless carriers outside the U.S. One of the advantages Google phones have long had is their quick access to Android updates. With other phones, individual manufacturers and carriers have to approve changes, resulting in delays . Google said Verizon will still have to approve updates for Pixel, but the process will be streamlined and done ahead of time. Google promises a spectacular camera and unlimited online storage for phones at full resolution. When storage space on the phone is low, the Pixel will free up storage and rely on the online copy. Apple takes a similar approach with its iCloud Photo Library, though free storage is limited to 5 gigabytes, or a few thousand photos. It's in Your Head Google's new virtual-reality headset, Daydream View, will differ from other headsets like Samsung's Gear VR in having a companion motion controller and compatibility with a wide range of phones, including Pixel. Daydream is also a challenge to more sophisticated, but expensive systems from Facebook's Oculus business, HTC and Sony -- as well as to Google's own Cardboard effort. Cardboard is cheap -- available for as little as $15 -- but it doesn't offer much control over VR environments beyond pushing a button on the headset as you move your head. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can function like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79. You'll need a new Android phone , as existing phones won't have the right hardware. Google also plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers to make Daydream headsets and controllers. An Echo of Amazon's Echo Google is promoting its new Home smart speaker as a way to access Google's knowledge -- hands free. Home will be able to perform many of the same tasks as Echo, Amazon's internet-connected speaker. Both will use voice commands to play music, field questions and control home appliances -- assuming you've installed "smart" versions of them. If you're feeling creepy about a speaker listening to your conversations, Google says you can turn the microphone off. Home will be available on Nov. 4 for about $130, with advance orders starting Tuesday. The cylinder-shaped Echo costs $180, though Amazon also sells a smaller version shaped like a hockey puck that sells for $50. What Else? Google's new video-streaming device, Chromecast Ultra, will support a higher-resolution video format called 4K. Larger, more expensive streaming devices such as the $100 Amazon Fire TV already do that. Ultra will cost $69. Meanwhile, Google wants to improve Wi-Fi in the home by creating its own router. The company said people use internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the home. The new Google Wi-Fi system will cost about $130 for the main device. A three-pack for larger homes will cost about $300. Beyond Google Even as it pushes Pixel, Google isn't abandoning the Android system that other manufacturers can use for free. That means Samsung, LG and others can keep making their own phones with Google software. In that sense, Google's approach is more like Microsoft's than Apple's. Microsoft also has been making hardware through its line of Surface computers running Windows. That puts Microsoft -- and now Google -- in the awkward position of promoting both its own devices and those of rivals that run the company's software. Beyond Hardware Google predicts that artificial intelligence will play a greater role in our lives. CEO Sundar Pichai said computing is transitioning to an AI-first world, just as it moved to a mobile-first world just a few years ago. "Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user," Pichai said. "We want to build a Google for each user." Google services along those lines include Google Assistant, software that's designed to answer questions and retrieve information, conversation-style. Google Assistant made its debut in a chat app called Allo a few weeks ago. It will also be part of Home and the new Pixel phones. The features demonstrated Tuesday seem similar to what Amazon and Apple already offer with their virtual assistants. Google officials have repeatedly emphasized that its AI technology is in the early stages -- so it remains to be seen what this new era for Google will lead to. Image Credit: Google/Made by Google.

The speaker has Google Assistant built right in and is designed to rival the popular Amazon Echo, letting you say voice commands in your home. Google Home is very similar to the Amazon Echo. It is based on a minimal design that's meant to blend in with its surroundings. Several different finishes and base designs are available, covering a range of colours in both metal and fabric variants. To ensure Home is welcome in your home, Google has made it as unobtrusive as possible. There are no blinking LED lights or buttons to detract from its clean appearance, although four LEDs and a mute switch can be found on the top panel. Home is designed to be controlled with your voice. When you talk to Home, you interact with Google Assistant, the company's new artificial intelligence software that's an integral part of the hardware it launched yesterday. It enables you to communicate with Google by talking using natural language queries, starting a conversation between you, the search engine and third-party services. As with Echo, Home can be activated from anywhere in the room it's placed in. You can ask Google for help with whatever you're doing. If you're busy in the kitchen but want to play some music, Home will be able to do it for you. Alternatively, if you want to check the weather while watching a film, Home allows you to get the current conditions by simply asking the question. Home's interaction model is based on human communication. Google Home Google Home includes a daily briefing capability that fills you in on the latest news and reminders for the day ahead, when you wake up. Saying "Tell me about the day" in the morning will deliver curated personal information to help you prepare for work each morning. Home can also act as an alarm clock to get you out of bed. "With Google Home, it’s as simple as using your voice to turn up the music, get answers to a myriad of questions, manage tasks around the house, and even adjust the thermostat or lights," said Google. It allows you to bring the Google Assistant into your kitchen, living room or anywhere else around the house." Home's assistant capabilities are its headline feature but Google has also taken care to ensure it excels as a general-use speaker. It uses a high-excursion driver in a dual-passive radiator design to spread audio across a room, despite being packaged in a compact body. According to Google, it delivers "crystal-clear highs and deep lows." You can play music from anywhere in your house by streaming over WiFi. Google envisions that people will want multiple Home speakers in their house, one for each major room. To lower the risk of several devices chiming in each time you say "OK Google," each speaker is linked together if signed in with the same Google account. When "OK Google" is detected, the speakers will work together to figure out which unit is closest to you. That one will then start the conversation. Google Home Google Home has a strong feature set but is coming to the market considerably behind established rivals, most notably Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo. The Echo has proven to be an unexpected hit in households. Google is understandably keen to replicate Amazon's success. The company is betting big on artificial intelligence being the driving force for future tech. It wants to have a presence in every area of the field. That includes building its own hardware to run its Assistant AI, in case Alexa should win customers over before Assistant has even launched. Google Home is available to pre-order today for $129, significantly less than the $179 Echo. Google is also bundling a free six-month trial of YouTube Red, including unlimited access to ad-free music and video. Home will start shipping to customers in November.

Mello Jr. Oct 5, 2016 9:00 AM PT Google on Tuesday unveiled a new smartphone and home hub that squarely aim at products from market leaders Apple and Amazon. The company's new branded smartphone, called "Pixel," marks a departure from past efforts. Up to now, Google's Nexus phones were made by a variety of manufacturers that sold them under their brands. "Google is trying to position itself as a complete supplier rather than simply offering Nexus-branded handsets that were rebatched by another company," said Jeff Orr, senior practice director for mobile devices at ABI Research. Google announced Pixel, along with its home entertainment and smart device hub, called "Google Home," at a launch event at Ghiradelli Square in San Francisco. At the forum, the company emphasized the unity of the ecosystem behind its new hardware offerings. "That's more of a challenge to a device leader such as Apple than an announcement of the next generation of Google-branded handsets," Orr told TechNewsWorld. Next Big Innovation Google needed to go into hardware to address an information explosion, said Vice President for Hardware Rick Osterloh at the launch event. "These informational changes mean that technology needs to be smart and just work for you. This is why we believe the next big innovation is going to take place at the intersection of hardware and software with AI at the center," he explained. "Hardware isn't a new area for Google, but now we're taking steps to showcase the very best of Google across a family of devices designed and built by us," Osterloh added. Google's new devices can provide new experiences for users. "The announcement of Google's phone comes into a market where we're seeing growth slow down in the premium segment," observed Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. That said, "they're bringing experiences to the phone way beyond the typical interaction we have on smartphones today," he told TechNewsWorld. Fast-Charging Battery In moving from providing an operating system -- Android -- to offering hardware for sale, Google is emulating another big tech player, noted Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. "Google is using the strategy Microsoft used with its Surface tablets," he told TechNewsWorld. "They're trying to make a statement with their brand." Microsoft isn't the only big tech player Google is cribbing notes from. "What Google is doing is trying to show how they can integrate all their software, services and hardware in a unified way -- in the same the way Apple does," O'Donnell said. "It's definitely a page out of Apple's book in that regard." Google's Pixel phones come in two models. The chief differences between them are the screen and battery sizes. The Pixel has a 5-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch), while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch AMOLED with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels (534 ppi). The Pixel has a 2,770 mAh battery, while the Pixel XL's is 3,450 mAh. Both batteries have a quick-charge feature that gives the phone seven hours of runtime on a 15-minute charge. Highly Rated Camera Both Pixel models have f/2.0 12.3 megapixel rear-facing cameras with large pixels -- 1.55 microns -- and support for 4K video. Their front-facing cameras are 8 MP with an f/2.4 aperture and support for HD video. The front-facing camera received high marks from testing outfit DxOMark. "With an overall DxOMark Mobile score of 89, Pixel, the latest Google smartphone, is the highest-rated smartphone camera we have ever tested," wrote reviewer David Cardinal. "Its image quality scores are impressive across the board, but it is particularly strong in providing a very high level of detail from its 12.3MP camera, with relatively low levels of noise for every tested lighting condition," he continued. "It also provides accurate exposures with very good contrast and white balance, as well as fast autofocus," Cardinal added. Pricing for the Pixel models starts at US$649 with 32 GB of memory. Units will be sold exclusively through Verizon, although unlocked versions of the phones will be offered through the online Google Store. Customers can preorder the Pixel now in the United States, UK, Canada, Australia and Germany. Google Home Pixel users who want to dabble in virtual reality will be able to do so with another new product introduced at the Google event. Daydream is a fabric headset that allows Pixel to be used as a VR screen. It will sell for $79 starting in November. Google also rolled out a competitor to Amazon's Echo home hub. Called "Google Home," the unit is voice-controlled and can play music, communicate with other devices in the home, provide anticipated information, and assist in everyday tasks like creating shopping lists, making dinner reservations and buying concert tickets. Google Home will sell for $129 -- about $50 less than Echo -- and it includes six months of the YouTube Red premium service for free. It is available now for preorder at the Google Store, as well as at Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Despite already owning an Echo, Tirias Research Principal Analyst Kevin Krewell already has preordered a Google Home. "The search on Echo is no way near as effective as plugging into Google search," he told TechNewsWorld. "When it comes to search, there is really no one better than Google at it."

In a report published Wednesday, Sheridan stated that Google announced during a presentation on Tuesday a new set of hardware devices which are intended to integrate the company's software and application innovations, including Google Assistant which "will rise in importance" heading forward. Related Link: Dollar Stores See Tailwinds Dissipating Google's increased focus on hardware based on its new devices signals a shift away from Google's prior strategy of relying on manufacturers to design the Android and Chrome ecosystem. Today, Google is now in a better position to compete against the likes of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the "escalating battle for mobile/home computing." However, Sheridan acknowledged that while Google is now in a better position to better control the user experience for its services, questions remain unanswered as to how other manufacturers will "digest Google's newfound role in the marketplace." In addition, the analyst cautioned that while Google's new products are price competitive relative to their competition, the new "go-to-market" is a "clear hurdle to wide acceptance" and will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome. Bottom line, Sheridan concluded that any success in Google's new hardware products could drive revenue upside it would also likely be paired with margin pressure. Shares of Alphabet remain Buy rated with an unchanged $925 price target. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

Register for an Exam Today> Google's New Lineup of Phones and Gadgets: A Quick Glance By Michael Liedtke and Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 05 2016 Google is taking a page from Apple's playbook by making a bigger push to build its own hardware. Rick Osterloh, head of Google's new hardware group, said that in doing so, Google can take full advantage of capabilities it's designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long designed both iPhone hardware and the iOS operating-system software that runs on it. Now, Google is doing the same with the upcoming Pixel phones running Google's Android system. The Pixel is one of several gadgets Google announced Tuesday in San Francisco. New Phone, New Branding, New Marketing Google's previous phones, dubbed Nexus, had limited distribution. Now, the company is casting aside the Nexus name in favor of Pixel, a brand that Osterloh said has "always represented the best of hardware and software designed by Google." And instead of relying primarily on online orders, as was the case with Nexus, Google will offer Pixel through Verizon as well, starting Oct. 20. Advance orders began Tuesday starting at roughly $650 for the 5-inch version and $750 for the slightly larger 5.5-inch screen. Google will also make Pixel available at Best Buy and various wireless carriers outside the U.S. One of the advantages Google phones have long had is their quick access to Android updates. With other phones, individual manufacturers and carriers have to approve changes, resulting in delays . Google said Verizon will still have to approve updates for Pixel, but the process will be streamlined and done ahead of time. Google promises a spectacular camera and unlimited online storage for phones at full resolution. When storage space on the phone is low, the Pixel will free up storage and rely on the online copy. Apple takes a similar approach with its iCloud Photo Library, though free storage is limited to 5 gigabytes, or a few thousand photos. It's in Your Head Google's new virtual-reality headset, Daydream View, will differ from other headsets like Samsung's Gear VR in having a companion motion controller and compatibility with a wide range of phones, including Pixel. Daydream is also a challenge to more sophisticated, but expensive systems from Facebook's Oculus business, HTC and Sony -- as well as to Google's own Cardboard effort. Cardboard is cheap -- available for as little as $15 -- but it doesn't offer much control over VR environments beyond pushing a button on the headset as you move your head. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can function like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79. You'll need a new Android phone , as existing phones won't have the right hardware. Google also plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers to make Daydream headsets and controllers. An Echo of Amazon's Echo Google is promoting its new Home smart speaker as a way to access Google's knowledge -- hands free. Home will be able to perform many of the same tasks as Echo, Amazon's internet-connected speaker. Both will use voice commands to play music, field questions and control home appliances -- assuming you've installed "smart" versions of them. If you're feeling creepy about a speaker listening to your conversations, Google says you can turn the microphone off. Home will be available on Nov. 4 for about $130, with advance orders starting Tuesday. The cylinder-shaped Echo costs $180, though Amazon also sells a smaller version shaped like a hockey puck that sells for $50. What Else? Google's new video-streaming device, Chromecast Ultra, will support a higher-resolution video format called 4K. Larger, more expensive streaming devices such as the $100 Amazon Fire TV already do that. Ultra will cost $69. Meanwhile, Google wants to improve Wi-Fi in the home by creating its own router. The company said people use internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the home. The new Google Wi-Fi system will cost about $130 for the main device. A three-pack for larger homes will cost about $300. Beyond Google Even as it pushes Pixel, Google isn't abandoning the Android system that other manufacturers can use for free. That means Samsung, LG and others can keep making their own phones with Google software. In that sense, Google's approach is more like Microsoft's than Apple's. Microsoft also has been making hardware through its line of Surface computers running Windows. That puts Microsoft -- and now Google -- in the awkward position of promoting both its own devices and those of rivals that run the company's software. Beyond Hardware Google predicts that artificial intelligence will play a greater role in our lives. CEO Sundar Pichai said computing is transitioning to an AI-first world, just as it moved to a mobile-first world just a few years ago. "Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user," Pichai said. "We want to build a Google for each user." Google services along those lines include Google Assistant, software that's designed to answer questions and retrieve information, conversation-style. Google Assistant made its debut in a chat app called Allo a few weeks ago. It will also be part of Home and the new Pixel phones. The features demonstrated Tuesday seem similar to what Amazon and Apple already offer with their virtual assistants. Google officials have repeatedly emphasized that its AI technology is in the early stages -- so it remains to be seen what this new era for Google will lead to. Image Credit: Google/Made by Google.
