The Good The edgeless display on Xiaomi's Mi Mix is simply amazing, and the ceramic rear gives the phone a luxurious feel. The base model has 128GB of storage. The Bad The phone is only sold in China and in limited quantities, and it's also Xiaomi's most expensive yet. The camera's pretty average at best and taking selfies can be awkward. The Bottom Line The Xiaomi Mi Mix is a glimpse of the all-screen future of phones. But Xiaomi needs to improve on basics like the camera and find a way to make more of these before we can wholeheartedly recommend it.

And believe me, it's awesome. The 6.4-inch screen covers almost the entire face of the phone, and the buttons you'd usually find on the front are now onscreen. The premium ceramic back gives the phone a luxurious high-end feel with a very good grip, quite unlike glass. But while the material is pretty hard and scratch resistant, you definitely don't want to drop it. There are some weird omissions and weaknesses. There's only one speaker in the traditional sense, which plays music and video. For calls, the phone uses a "cantilever ceramic piezoelectric actuator", which just means that the phone's body vibrates to deliver sound. The camera isn't great, either. The Mi Mix is only on sale in China, and even there in limited quantities. While you can get it from third-party online resellers, good luck getting it fixed if you break it, as the parts used in the phone are rare as hens' teeth. Plus its 4G LTE bands are limited, so it may not work properly outside China. Xiaomi's Mi Mix is one amazing almost bezel-less... See full gallery 1 - 5 of 16 Next Prev It's also the most expensive Xiaomi phone so far. Our review model costs 3,499 yuan, which converts to around $510, AU$680 or £420. In China, that's about half the price of phones like the Google Pixel. There's also a premium model with 18-carat gold embossing, 6GB 0f RAM (up from 4GB) and 256GB of onboard storage (up from the base model's 128GB) for 3,999 yuan, which is roughly $590, AU$770 or £480. If you're thinking of getting one, bear in mind that Chinese phones don't come with Google services installed (like Google Maps and even Google Play), and you'll have work to do to get those integrated properly. Big screen phones like the Google ​Pi​xel XL or the iPhone 7 Plus are much more easily procured -- you'll just have to accept a smaller screen than the Mi Mix's mammoth 6.4-inch display. Crazy-beautiful edgeless display is incredible I kid you not. While our photos and video might be enough to convince you, it's when you pick up the phone, hold it in your hand and watch the 6.4-inch screen come to life that the whole idea of a magical bezel-less phone sinks in. I've been using the phone for around a week now, and I still can't help but feel amazed every time I turn it on. Now, I'm really not a fan of big-screen phones. I personally feel anything above 6 inches is unusable, and I didn't really like the Xiaomi Mi Max (the company's other super large 6.4-inch phone). Strangely, I found myself learning to like and use the Mix a lot more. The screen is still pretty big, but it doesn't feel it compared to the Max, which is bigger in size thanks to its bezels. The palm rejection system on the Mix is a lot better too, which means you don't tap as many things by accident. View full gallery Look ma, (almost) no bezels! Aloysius Low/CNET An edge-to-edge screen means my palms were almost always touching the display, but despite that I didn't accidentally press buttons I shouldn't have or move the home screen while holding the phone in my hand. This is great, particularly compared with my experiences with phones that don't properly implement this feature. Big screen phones tend to feel unwieldy, but not so with the Mix. While it's a little on the heavy side at 209 grams (7.37 ounces), it's perfectly balanced in your hand. I've been able to use it one handed at times, though it's obviously a lot easier with both hands depending on what you want to do with it, like typing long messages. To get a phone that's mostly all screen, with a 2,080x1,080-pixel display, Xiaomi had to do some pretty nifty engineering. The phone's selfie camera got moved to the bottom of the phone -- not necessarily a good thing, as I'll explain below -- and underneath the display is the piezoelectric actuator that replaces your front speaker. The actuator converts digital signals into analog vibrations, using the body of the phone to deliver sound to your ears. It works, though you can feel the whole phone rumbling in time to your voice call. There's only one thing about the phone I don't really like -- well, apart from how much of a fingerprint magnet it is. It's that the ambient light sensor, located at the bottom chin of the phone, is easily blocked if you're resting the phone on say, a pillow, while using it, leading to a dimmer screen which can make things hard to see in normal light. You can turn off auto-brightness as a solution, so it's a minor irritant in the grand scheme of things. View full gallery While it lacks bezels at the top and sides, the bottom is where you'll find a chin as well as a 5-megapixel selfie camera. Aloysius Low/CNET Android-powered...somewhat Like most Chinese smartphones, the Mi Mix is powered by Android -- in this case, Android 6.0, but a heavily customised version of it called MIUI. This is Xiaomi's version of Android, and it has features taken from both iOS and Google's software.

Several people who recently bought Google's new Pixel phone on behalf of a New Hampshire dealer are now suffering that punishment after the company detected their online purchases and judged they violated its terms of service. Those rules, outlined in a document that few people read closely , forbid the purchase of the Pixel for "commercial" resale. "There isn't an hour that doesn't go by that I don't think about the enormity of what Google has done to me," said one of the affected resellers, Shmuel Super of Brooklyn, New York. "This is like a digital death sentence." FILE- In this Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, the new Google Pixel phone is displayed next to a Daydream View virtual-reality headset, right, following a Google product event in San Francisco. Google is teaching a devastating lesson to some of its unwitting users: if you dare violate the company¿s policies, you can be abruptly cut off from your Gmail account and other digital services where vital information, indispensable documents and cherished photos are stored. Consumers who recently bought Pixel phones for a New Hampshire dealer are suffering through that harsh punishment after the internet company detected online purchases that violated its terms of service. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) SELL YOUR PHONE, LOSE YOUR ACCOUNT Super and his fellow resellers got into trouble for buying up to five Pixel phones from Google's online store and having them delivered to New Hampshire for resale. They received $5 for each phone. As of Sunday, some started finding themselves locked out of their Google accounts. In a Thursday statement, Google described the resale arrangement as a "scheme" devised by a dealer looking to sell the Pixels at marked-up prices in violation of its policies. Google declined to say how many people were affected by the account lockdown. DansDeals , a consumer-focused website that first reported Google's crackdown, concluded that more than 200 people had been blocked from their Google accounts after talking to the New Hampshire dealer behind the Pixel buying spree. The Associated Press was unsuccessful in its efforts to identify and interview the dealer. The crackdown may come as a surprise to the hundreds of millions of people who now routinely rely on Google, Facebook, Apple and other tech companies as the caretakers of their digital lives. Few of the people involved in this situation appear to have backed up their data outside of Google. Google said it plans to restore the accounts of customers who it believes were unaware of the rules, although the company didn't specify how long that might take. LIVING WITHOUT GOOGLE Once they figured out why they were being locked out, the exiled consumers realized how dependent they had become on Google as the custodian of their digital communications, records and other mementoes. Some said they couldn't retrieve confirmation numbers for upcoming flights or notices about an upcoming credit-card payment. Others couldn't fetch work documents or medical records. Some started getting phone calls from friends, family and colleagues wondering why they weren't responding to emails. Like other two other people interviewed by the AP, Super said he had no idea that he was violating Google's policies when he bought the Pixels for the New Hampshire dealer. He can't believe Google would do something as extreme as locking him out of his account without warning, rather than just banning him from buying its phones in the future. "Google's slogan is 'Don't be evil,' but to me, there is nothing more evil that what Google has done here," Super said. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT Some of the Pixels purchased for resale were delivered before Google recognized the violations and meted out a punishment spelled out in a separate terms-of-service document . "We may suspend or stop providing our services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct," Google warns in one section. Google doesn't give any advance notice before it shuts down an account, and doesn't make distinctions between minor and major violations. Affected users can appeal for reinstatement, though it's unclear how long that might take or what criteria Google uses in such cases. Apple also forbids online purchases of iPhones for resale, although its terms of service say only that the company reserves the right to cancel any order suspected of breaking the rule. Daniel Levy, who has been locked out from his Google account since Monday, said he has learned a hard lesson, though not necessarily the one the company intended. "They confiscated my property and shouldn't be trusted," said Levy, who lives in Lakewood, New Jersey. "I will never use their services again."

The reports are claiming that Google has basically suspended the accounts of hundreds of people who took advantage of a sales tax loophole and made a little profit when reselling their Pixel devices. Basically what happened is that these customers bought the Pixel phones through Google’s Project Fi carrier and shipped them directly to New Hampshire, a state that has no sales tax. The reseller in the state then split the profit with the customers who sold them the phones. According to reseller Dan’s Deals, they have been exploiting this loophole for years without any issue, so it is curious as to why Google is suddenly cracking down on it. It should also be noted that the suspension is for the user’s entire Google account. This means that any emails, contacts, photos, videos, documents, and etc. that are linked to the account have been locked, and that the account’s owner can no longer access them. One user even claims that an account that was not used to buy the phone was also suspended as it was listed as the backup address for the main account. Google has yet to comment on the bans, but according to Daniel Eleff, the owner of the site, “I’m not defending those who violated the terms of the sale, but I do think it is heavy handed for Google to block access to all of their services for doing so. Was violating Google’s phone resale policy really worthy of an effective digital death penalty?” Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Google, Legal and pixel.

Updated: November 20, 2016 @ 10:56 am Full Forecast Obituaries News Sports Fun Buy & Sell Close AP Will Snapchat Spectacles Succeed Where Google Glass Failed? newsfeedback@fool.com (Leo Sun) Updated Nov 17, 2016 0 Snap's Snapchat recently started selling its Spectacles -- glasses with a built-in camera for video capture -- in vending machines. However, the $130 device has been tough to find since the "Snapbot" vending machines are as ephemeral as Snapchat's vanishing pictures -- they only stay in a single location for 24 hours before disappearing, and Snapchat only announces the next location 24 hours in advance. Image source: Snap Inc. It's a clever marketing strategy which has generated lots of hype. Wired reports that people were lining up in the L.A. area to buy the Spectacles, and that they quickly sold out. Shortly afterwards, reports claimed that scalpers were selling the device for as much as $5,000 online. Customers seem much more eager to buy Spectacles than Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Glass -- but will this initial momentum help it succeed where Glass failed? Why Google Glass failed To see if Spectacles can succeed, we should remember why Google Glass failed. First, the "Explorer" version of Glass cost a whopping $1,500 -- limiting its appeal to affluent gadget enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers. Second, the device looked awkward, and hiring acclaimed designer Diane von Furstenberg to make them more fashion-friendly didn't help. Google also tried to add smartphone-like apps to Glass' heads-up display, but many were implemented poorly and ran slower than they did on regular smartphones. It was also unclear who Glass was designed for. Instead of promoting the device for practical uses in education, law enforcement, or construction, Google advertised it as a device for capturing experiences from a first-person view akin to GoPro's (NASDAQ: GPRO) action cameras. However, GoPro cameras were cheaper and more durable, and captured much higher-quality images and videos than Glass. Google also didn't realize that people didn't like Glass "Explorers" wandering into public areas and staring at them. Since there was no visible indicator of whether or not photos and videos were being captured, businesses banned Glass users from their establishments. Google issued etiquette guidelines for Glass to counter the backlash, but the device was so widely mocked that it was finally discontinued last year. Google Glass. Image source: Google. Why Spectacles might succeed To sell Spectacles, Snap is leveraging something that Google lacked -- a growing social networking presence. Between June 2014 and June 2016, Snapchat's daily active users soared from 59 million to 150 million. With that reach, especially among millennials (about 70% of its user base, according to eMarketer), Snap has the clout to expand its ecosystem with new software and hardware products. Snap also seems to have done its homework regarding Glass' shortcomings. Spectacles come in much cheaper at $130, and the ephemeral vending machine strategy generates much more hype than Google's Explorer sign-up program. The Spectacles also look like wacky toys instead of serious tech devices -- which may make them more socially acceptable. Its case, which doubles as a charging dock, is also more innovative than Glass' basic USB charging cable. Instead of featuring a wide variety of mediocre apps, Spectacles only does one thing -- take first-person Snaps. Most importantly, the device alerts bystanders by lighting up while capturing content, eliminating the creepiness factor of Google Glass.

But other companies besides Snap are clearly learning from its failure.  Sony (NYSE: SNE) subsequently promoted its SmartEyeglass AR headset to enterprise users instead of mainstream consumers. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) made its "mixed reality" HoloLens headset a tethered PC-based device for productivity and entertainment instead of a free-roaming AR one to be worn in public. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is also reportedly testing out a pair of AR glasses for mainstream consumers, and might address Glass' shortcomings in the same manner as Snap. It's unclear if Spectacles will succeed where Glass failed, and Snap probably won't release any hard sales figures for the device. But the initial demand and buzz indicate that it's off to a strong start, and it may finally pave the way for AR glasses to gain mainstream approval.

SUBSCRIBE Moz beefs up Moz Local with new features, distribution and automation With new activity alerts, GMB sync and reputation management, the expanded Moz Local is intended to equally serve the small business, agency and enterprise markets. Greg Sterling on November 17, 2016 at 3:31 pm More Moz has overhauled and enhanced its Moz Local offering, adding new features and automation the company says were requested by users and the broader local SEO community. The product previously offered listings monitoring and syndication. Moz says that it had conversations with its numerous customers, agency partners and the broader community before revamping the product. The new features add speed and workflow improvements, according to the company. These new features include: Google My Business sync: automatically synchronizes listings with GMB. Users can manage changes and updates directly from the Moz dashboard Listing alerts: provides an activity feed if listings data are overwritten or in some other way changed vs. the information in the Moz-managed listing Reputation monitoring/management: new monitoring of Google reviews, which joins comparable functionality for a range of directories, including Foursquare, Yelp, YP and others. New reviews are also available as they’re published, within the Moz dashboard. Users can respond to Google reviews as well. Expanded distribution: new data providers/partners added to its existing sources (Acxiom, Factual, Infogroup, Neustar Localeze and “a few powerful directories”). Those new distribution sources include Hotfrog, Apple Maps, HERE, TomTom and Navmii. Some of these come through a partnership through NavAds. Improved SEO metrics for organic rankings and the Local Pack. In the same post announcing the product expansion, Moz identifies its major competitors: Brandify Bright Local MomentFeed Rio SEO SIM Partners Vendasta Yext One of the more interesting new features is the activity feed, which shows agencies or marketers that the system is working. This has been one of the challenges for SEO practitioners, especially when it comes to the SMB market: proving that listings/presence management is actually delivering value. Expanded reputation management has been added, in part because Google review counts and corresponding scores are now ranking factors. However, it’s also a key consumer consideration. Moz competitor Yext recently launched a new reviews product because of their growing importance on various fronts. Many will read this and think these features already exist elsewhere. Indeed they do; however, Moz argues its local SEO expertise is unsurpassed and that, holistically, the new tools together produce a superior product. Moz also says that use of its software delivered a nearly 20 percent average “Listing Score” increase across its customer base, as well as greatly improved visibility/reach. The new and improved Moz Local is intended to equally serve the small business, agency and enterprise markets. It’s available in three tiers: essential, professional and premium, which range in price from roughly $9 to $21 per month.

Samsung’s $8 billion buy now makes it a market leader in mobile devices, home automation, and connected cars. Should Apple and Google start worrying? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 17, 2016 at 5:06PM Samsung Electronics (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) recently agreed to buy Harman International Industries (NYSE:HAR) for about $8 billion to expand its presence in connected and automotive electronics. Harman, a market leader in connected car solutions, supplies over 30 million vehicles with infotainment, telematics, safety, and security solutions. Image source: Harman. About 65% of Harman's $7 billion in revenues last year came from the automotive market, and its backlog orders hit $24 billion at the end of June. Samsung CEO Oh-Hyun Kwon claimed that the acquisition "perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time." Merging Harman's automotive businesses with Samsung's mobile and smart appliances businesses would make the tech giant a force to be reckoned with in the Internet of Things (IoT) market -- and that could spell trouble for companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Why Samsung needed Harman Samsung is the world's biggest manufacturer of smartphones and consumer electronics. The company's biggest weakness is its dependence on mobile devices, which accounted for 46% of its top line last quarter. That business has been shrinking due to commoditization and its costly Note 7 blunder. To diversify away from that market, Samsung launched new wearable devices and smart appliances to expand its software ecosystem, and acquired smart home company SmartThings two years ago. To reduce its dependence on Google Android, Samsung launched its own OS, Tizen, for wearables and select smartphones. Image source: SmartThings. With those products in place, Samsung carved out a decent moat against rival ecosystems like Apple's HomeKit and Google's Home/Nest. But one area where it lagged behind was the auto market. Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto took over dashboards with their mirroring features, but Samsung users were stuck with MirrorLink, a clumsier protocol which is also used by Sony and HTC devices. But by acquiring Harman, Samsung instantly becomes a Tier 1 auto supplier, and it will generate cost-cutting synergies by vertically integrating its processor and display businesses. Furthermore, Harman's future products will be built with Samsung's ecosystem integration in mind -- which should work more smoothly than products that are merely "compatible" with Apple and Google's mobile and IoT devices. How Samsung counters Apple and Google Simply put, a person who owns a Samsung phone, Samsung/SmartThings smart appliances, and a Harman-equipped car could easily have their personal data synchronized across all three "hubs." This is the kind of "ubiquitous computing" Google has talked about for years, and the kind of game-changing expansion Apple needs to diversify away from its core hardware devices. Neither Google nor Apple can compete against Samsung's dominant position in first-party consumer electronics like smart TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines. Both companies need third-party appliance makers to make their devices compatible with Home or HomeKit for them to sync to their mobile apps. That strategy is a fairly safe one, since Google and Apple merely leverage their leading positions in mobile devices to expand their IoT ecosystems without shouldering the costs of manufacturing new hardware. However, that strategy also relies on those partners making reliable appliances which work correctly with their smart home ecosystems. The same issues could affect cars which don't sync correctly with iOS and Android devices. Why Google and Apple shouldn't worry... yet Samsung's game plan sounds ambitious, but it could be bogged down by technical issues. Samsung's SmartThings platform was plagued with glitches earlier this year, and researchers claimed that the platform was poorly protected from malicious hacks. The recent Mirai botnet attack, which used hijacked IoT devices like routers and IP cameras to knock major websites offline, could also discourage consumers to connect everything to the internet. Samsung's previous attempts to carve out its own non-Google ecosystem -- like Tizen, S Health, Milk Music, and the Galaxy Apps Store -- also haven't been very effective. Instead, each attempt merely revealed that the majority of Samsung owners preferred using Google's services. Samsung might now have the leverage in mobile hardware, consumer electronics, and connected cars to start building a cohesive IoT ecosystem, but Google and Apple's clout in mobile operating systems will likely counter that push by simply convincing hardware makers to tether their products to their Android and iOS-based apps. Therefore, Samsung's purchase of Harman was a smart move which will give it a growing automotive parts business, but it probably won't enable it to topple Google, Apple, and others in the growing smart home/car market just yet.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Delete Your Gmail or Google Account Maybe you haven’t actually used Gmail for years. Maybe you want to take a stand against Google in general. Maybe you’re not sure why you created a Google account in the first place. Whatever your reason, Google makes it surprisingly easy for you to delete your account. First: Download Your Google Emails and Other Data Once you delete your account, it’s completely gone, and that includes all of the information you’ve stored on Google services. If you want to save your emails, your YouTube uploads, and everything else you’ve added to Google products over the years, you’ll have to back them up first. Happily, Google offers a tool for doing this. Head to Google Takeout and you can download, en masse, all of your Google data. Your Gmail history, for example, is offered as an mbox download that you can open in an email program like Mozilla Thunderbird. The process is straightforward, but there are a lot of choices. We’ve outlined how to use Google Takeout before, if you want more details. Alternatively, we outlined another way to back up your Gmail account before proceeding, so check that out if you’re not sure what to do with an mbox download. RELATED ARTICLES How to Create and Download an Archive of All Your Google Data How To Download/Backup Your Gmail, Google+, Calendar, and Docs Data Deleting Your Account: You Have Two Options Head to Google’s official preferences page and you’ll see a couple of options: delete products, or Delete Google account and data. The first option lets you delete specific services, including Gmail. Use this and you can delete all of your emails, along with your email address, but leave the rest of your Google account up and running. The second option deletes everything your Google account does, including YouTube and Google Drive, and all the documents you’ve uploaded to those services. Here’s how both of these options work, with screenshots for every step of the way. Delete Only Your Gmail Account The first option, “delete products,” gives you a list of Google services you use, and a trash can you can click to delete any of them. To delete your Gmail account, click the trash can next to Gmail. According to Google, deleting your Gmail account means: Your Gmail address can’t be used by you or anyone else in the future. Your emails will be deleted. Your Google Account, including purchases made on Google Play and your search history, won’t be deleted. When you click the trash can next to Gmail, you’ll be told to add another email address here, which you will use to access your other Google services (Google Drive, YouTube, etc). Enter your current primary email address (not the address you’re deleting) then click “Send Verification Email.” An email will be sent to that account, and it will look something like this: Go ahead and click the link. You’ll be taken to yet another page, where you can confirm one more time that this is what you want to do. This is your last warning, so be absolutely certain that everything is backed up before you click the checkbox and click “Delete Account.” Once you do that, you’ve officially deleted your Gmail account. You can still log into your Google account to access things like YouTube, but you’ll need to use the new email address you provided earlier. Delete Your Entire Google Account If deleting your Gmail account isn’t enough, you can also delete your entire Google account. We recommend you download and archive all of your Google data before doing so. This includes your emails, your contacts, your documents on Google Drive, and even your YouTube uploads. The process of deleting your entire Google account is actually simpler than just deleting your Gmail. First you’ll be asked to confirm that this is what you actually want to do. Be absolutely certain this is the case before you check the boxes and click “Delete Account”, because all of your data will go away when you’re done. Next, you’ll be told that your account is deleted. That’s it. You have a very short window to potentially recover your account, but be quick about it. Really, it’s best that you don’t start this process until you’re completely certain you’ve backed everything up and have no further use for the account.

However, there are many news sources you can choose from, so here’s how to customize what you want to listen to. RELATED ARTICLE How to Set Up Google Home Amazon recently changed the way you choose what news sources you can listen to on your Amazon Echo, by requiring you to download individual Alexa Skills for each news source. However, Google Home makes it a bit easier to pick and choose what you want to listen to. To start, open up the Google Home app on your smartphone and tap on the Devices button in the top-right corner of the screen. Next, tap on the menu button in the upper-right corner. Select “Settings”. Tap on “More”. Select “News”. You’ll see a list of current news sources that Google Home uses, but tapping on “Customize” will allow you to change this. Simply place a checkmark next to a news source that you want to use, and uncheck any sources that you don’t want to use. Sources are sorted by topic, so you can scroll through and easily find sources you want based on the topic. Once you select the news sources you want, go back to the previous screen by hitting the back arrow in the top-left corner. Next, tap and hold on the far right side of a news source to drag it up or down the list to prioritize what you want to listen to first. Any changes will instantly save and you can now exit out of the app and take advantage of your new lineup of news sources. By saying “Ok Google, listen to the news”, audio versions of your selected news sources will play one after another. Any time you want to stop listening, just say “Ok Google, stop”.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Knights Mill mega-chip to take on GPUs in A.I. Lack of a high-quality GPU may hold Intel back on A.I. and VR Intel snags Nervana for a crash course on deep learning Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel is taking a new direction in chip development as it looks to the future of artificial intelligence, with the company betting the technology will pervade applications and web services. Intel on Thursday said it is developing new chips that will handle A.I. workloads, which will increasingly be a part of its chip future. For now, the A.I. chips will be released as specialized primary chips or co-processors in computers and separate from the major product lines. But over time, Intel could adapt and integrate the A.I. features into its mainstream server, IoT, and perhaps even PC chips. The A.I. features could be useful in servers, drones, robots and autonomous cars. Intel is aggressively chasing these sectors as it tries to diversify outside the weakening PC market. A.I. computing is dominated by GPUs from Nvidia and custom chips from companies like Google. Intel's plan is to offer a wide range of alternate non-GPU chips for deep learning in a bid to accelerate its entry to A.I. Intel lost an opportunity in the mobile market because it was a late entrant, and it doesn't want to repeat that mistake in A.I. Intel lacks a potent GPU to chase A.I. but hopes the alternative chips will fill the gap. The company believes it does not need a GPU and doesn't want to put all its eggs in one basket, like Nvidia has.  Intel is developing a monster A.I. chip, code-named Knights Mill, that's targeted at deep learning, and it will be part of the Xeon Phi chip family. The company has shared few details about the chip, but it will be four times faster in deep-learning tasks than the current Xeon Phi chip, code-named Knights Landing, said Jason Waxman, corporate vice president in the Data Center Group at Intel. Knights Mill will ship next year, and the timing provides a snapshot of how urgently Intel is trying to speed up its entry into the A.I. space. There was a four-year gap between the release of its two previous Xeon Phi processors. Knights Mill will have several unique features compared to other chips Intel has developed. Unlike Intel's high-performance chips that focus on precise calculations, Knights Mill will string together a series of speedy, low-level floating-point calculations to reach conclusions. Those conclusions get to the essence of deep learning -- some conclusions like the identification of an image may not always be precise. But as the computer deep-learning model grows stronger, the conclusions will be more accurate. In the first half of next year, Intel will also release the first deep-learning hardware from its recent acquisition of Nervana Systems. That chip will be targeted mostly toward training -- creating computer models for deep learning. It could also be used for inferencing, which enhances deep-learning models through additional input. The Nervana chip will be mainly targeted toward servers. Intel will initially release it as a card that can be plugged into a standard PCI-Express port. But over time, the hardware will be integrated closer to the processor, said Naveen Rao, vice president and general manager of artificial intelligence solutions at Intel and the founder of Nervana Systems. The two new chips will add up to a stash of A.I. chips already in Intel's arsenal. Intel recently acquired Movidius, maker of computer vision chips used in Google Glass. The Movidius chips could be used in wearables, drones and robots for object recognition and depth measurement. Intel also sells FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which are circuits that can reprogrammed to do specific tasks. Intel wants to put FPGAs in servers, autonomous cars, robots and drones. Intel next year will ship the Deep Learning Inference Accelerator, an FPGA that competes with inferencing chips like Google’s Tensor Processing Unit. Intel's urgency is sparked by a surge of interest in A.I., a technology still in its infancy. Digital information is being fed from sensors, and A.I. is an emerging technique to make sense of that data. Large companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are deploying software and hardware that can try to make sense of the large amounts of information. One A.I. example is Microsoft's Cortana, which applies algorithms and FPGAs to recognize speech. The effectiveness of these systems is heavily defined by the software stack used to sandbox deep-learning models. The software stack acquired from Nervana will serve as Intel's parallel programming framework for deep learning. The open-source framework will compete with popular options like Caffe, Torch, Google's TensorFlow, and Microsoft's CNTK (Cognitive Toolkit). But will all these A.I. chips cause confusion for customers? The more the better, Waxman said; Intel wants to provide customers with a wide range of alternatives. Some chips are better at specific tasks. For example, FPGAs are better at single-inferencing tasks like recognizing cats or dogs in images, Waxman said. It's important that Intel move quickly to get a piece of the A.I. market, said Jim McGregor, the principal analyst at Tirias Research. By throwing many A.I. chips into the market, Intel wants to see which one will stick, he said. "It's good Intel's getting out there with multiple solutions. But Intel doesn't have any advantage over anyone else," McGregor said. But there are risks. Intel bought Nervana Systems for its software stack, and any attempt to lock customers to those tools won't be accepted by the industry, McGregor said. Nervana's tools are open source but are designed for Intel's chips, but competing frameworks like Caffe are gaining in popularity. "It's a questionable strategy. Intel's done this for the past decade, and they tried to push everyone down their path," McGregor said. But deep learning is in its infancy. It will take time to perfect computational techniques for deep learning, and new types of hardware like quantum computers and brain-mimicking chips could alter the landscape. "We're still learning how to learn," McGregor said. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

The more logical of the cases is Google Earth-themed, which changes your phone’s wallpaper to a different landscape photo pulled from Google Earth each day. You can press the shortcut button to learn more about that location, too. The live wallpaper magic relies on a NFC connection. Okay, so the Google Earth case sounds nifty and perhaps even useful for discovering new places. Good job, Google. Google The other new phone case is truly questionable. The Google Trends Live Case sets trending search topics as your wallpaper, which could get depressing real fast. For now, the cases are only available in the US and Canada, but the topics will change depending on where users are located. Double tapping on a trending topic will flip to a new one, whereas pressing the shortcut button will provide more details. These are the trending searches in the US right now: Would you want any of these to pop up right as you take out your phone? I’m not sure. I’d hate to be constantly reminded of current events, but maybe you’re more masochistic than me. As an aside, the cases look lovely. Google Both the Google Earth Live Case and the Google Trends Live Case cost $49.99 and are available through Google’s online store, Best Buy, and Verizon.

Read more about the stories in today's news: IBM Opens Global Headquarters for Security Services IoT Devices Evolving Rapidly as Favorite DDoS Attack Tool, Experts Say Google, Facebook Act to Keep Ads Off of Known 'Fake News' Sites Microsoft Takes Platinum Membership in Linux Foundation       Today's topics include the official opening of IBM's new security services headquarters in Massachusetts, security experts’ warnings that the cyber threats to the Internet of Things will only increase, Google and Facebook’s plan to block advertising traffic to fake news sites and Microsoft’s announcement that it is now a Platinum member of the Linux Foundation. IBM is officially opening its new global security headquarters in Cambridge, MA, providing a new base of operations for the company's $2 billion a year security business. Along with the new headquarters, IBM is opening what it calls the industry's first "commercial Cyber Range," which is a cyber-threat simulator to train clients who need to learn how to deal with cyber-attacks. IBM is also launching a new Incident Response and Intelligence Services team. After massive Distributed Denial of Service attacks in October, security experts are warning that the relative lack of security of the Internet of Things will continue to make connected devices favored targets of attackers looking to create botnets to drive DDoS traffic to new unprecedented scales. On Nov 16 security experts testified before two subcommittees in the U.S. House of Representatives, warning Congress that a lack of focus on security has made the Internet of Things a playground for hackers. The hearing follows the October attacks against Internet-infrastructure provider Dyn, which struggled for more than 11 hours to mitigate a flood of data that caused its domain services to become unreachable and resulted in intermittent service outages for its clients, including Twitter, Netflix, Etsy, Paypal and Spotify. Google this week joined Facebook in announcing that it would restrict revenue-generating advertisements from being placed on websites purveying fake news. The move appears to be in response to the criticism that both companies have received in recent days for allowing some websites to distribute fake news pertaining to the recent U.S. presidential election. Some believe that the false reports, a majority of them unfavorable to presidential contender Hillary Clinton, played a role in President-Elect Donald Trump's victory. Going forward, Google will also restrict ad service on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the primary purpose of the website or the publisher's content. In a move that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, Microsoft today announced it is becoming a Platinum member of the Linux Foundation. As a Platinum member, Microsoft will provide $500,000 a year to the Linux Foundation and pledges to support the group's open-source and Linux efforts. Microsoft has been moving incrementally toward embracing Linux and open source over the past eight years, though the interaction with the Linux community initially was somewhat hostile. Now, however, Microsoft's $500,000 yearly Platinum membership dues will help the Linux Foundation in its many efforts to advance Linux and open-source technology.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Nov 17, 2016 at 4:28PM Image Source: AMD. What happened Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged for the second day in a row on Thursday following the announcement that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google planned to integrate AMD's server GPUs into its cloud platform. AMD stock was up about 9.5% at 3:30 p.m. EST, adding to a gain of nearly 10% on Wednesday. So what Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) already has a presence at most of the major cloud-computing vendors, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform. For AMD, the Google deal marks the second significant cloud win for the company in recent months, following a deal that will put its GPUs into Alibaba's cloud. The Google deal represents progress for AMD, which has failed to capitalize on the growing trend of GPUs being used in the data center to the same extent as NVIDIA. NVIDIA's data center business is booming, with revenue tripling during the third quarter, to $240 million. AMD doesn't break out its data center GPU sales. While some optimism is warranted due to this deal, Google is also adding NVIDIA GPUs to its cloud platform. This move fits in with Google's general push to make its cloud platform heterogeneous, not dependent on any single vendor. The company is working on developing a server based on IBM's POWER9 CPU, for example. Supporting both major GPU vendors makes sense given this strategy. Now what A recent note from analyst Ian Ing estimates that artificial intelligence could be a $15 billion opportunity for chip companies by 2025. NVIDIA is singled out as having an advantage in this area, while AMD is considered "too resource constrained to fully address the opportunity." With AMD fighting to win back market share in the GPU and CPU markets on a research and development budget that has been slashed over the past few years, that concern seems valid. The Google cloud deal is certainly good news for AMD. But a 20% move in two days is hard to justify. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Finding good sources is trickier, which is where the Google Play Newsstand app can lend an assist. Like many of Google’s apps, the Google Play Newsstand app is linked up to your main Google account. The new app is easy to peruse with scrollable categories across the top for things like Top News, Sports, Technology and Entertainment among others. Seeing what is going on in the world is as simple as firing up the app and looking at the main screen, but you can tailor things to a degree including notifications. If you want to adjust your feeds, you can do so through the Library section which allows you to alter your sources. The app is smart as well, so it will pick up on the types of stories you enjoy and make sure to include them in your feeds once it learns your habits. Multimedia has also been greatly enhanced and improved for mobile use. If you prefer your news on a larger screen have no fear as the new Google Play Newsstand app can handle that as well. Google Play Newsstand is now available through a new web app. Again, it’s synced up to your account which gives you a seamless experience whether you are browsing on your mobile and switch to the web or vice versa. Just like it’s mobile counterpart, the web app has a clean style and looks to be easy to navigate as long as you’re savvy to the icons. When it comes to apps, you never know what you will get from Google or when you’ll get it. That is especially true for updates as this one has been a long time coming. The Google Play Newsstand app is something plenty of folks forgot about, but something you’ll want to pick up now that it’s been revamped. The app is available to download for Android or iOS if you are on a mobile or you can opt for the web app on PC’s and Macs.

Resell Your Google Pixel, Get Locked Out of Your Account? By Angela Moscaritolo November 17, 2016 03:10pm EST 10 Comments More than 200 Pixel phones shipped by buyers to a dealer in New Hampshire have been bricked by Google. Update 11/18: It looks like Pixel resellers are in luck. The Guardian reports that Google has reversed its decision to disable the accounts. The company emailed affected users, telling them that it they can once again access their accounts. In its email Google reportedly warned, however, that "repeated violations of our terms may lead to account termination." Original Story 11/17: Considering a little side gig reselling Pixel handsets for a small profit? It might be easy work, but if you care at all about being able to access your Google Account, we'd advise against it. Word has it that Google has disabled the accounts of more than 200 people for reselling Pixels. DansDeals.com reports that these individuals all bought Pixel phones and had them shipped directly to a dealer in New Hampshire, who paid them a profit on each device. "There is no sales tax in New Hampshire and the phones are then resold to others," the report notes. The only issue with this plan: Google doesn't allow it. The company's terms of service states that people may only purchase devices for personal use or to give as a gift. Google prohibits people from commercially reselling any device. Apparently the dealer "feels awful" about the whole thing. That doesn't really help the more than 200 people who are now locked out of their accounts, and can't access their Gmail, Google Drive, or any other Google services. "Google has apparently closed the accounts of everyone who shipped their phones directly to his address in New Hampshire, regardless of how many phones the account ordered or whether the phones actually shipped or were cancelled by Google," the report notes. //Related Articles Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7: Android Flagship Showdown Google has sent messages to those people's recovery emails stating that all their account data will be deleted if they don't successfully appeal the suspension. Some of the people reportedly used several different accounts to place orders for phones, however, so they're locked out of all of them. On a positive note, the dealer in question is reportedly "more than happy to return all the phones to Google if it will rectify the situation." Apparently, this person has been doing the same thing since Google launched the original Nexus, and has never had a problem before now. We've reached out to Google about the situation, but have yet to hear back.

This is the second app Google has overhauled just this week, following Google Play Music. The updated news app has a new design and is generally meant to make it easier to find something to read; it’s also launching on the web for the first time. Newsstand now has four tabs to make it easier to navigate the news. The main For You tab houses both a personalized briefing and an AI-powered recommendation stream at the bottom of the screen. The app has reworked its interface to combine top stories, major headlines, and suggested articles based on a user’s interests and preferences. This blend of content makes identifying top stories simpler, while allowing for deeper exploration of potentially interesting topics. The Library, Explore, and Read Later tabs contain sites and subjects you’ve picked out, additional stories to browse through, and saved articles, respectively. This version of the Newsstand, 4.0, also includes full-bleed images, autoplaying videos, and built-in playback controls for podcasts. In the For You tab, each recommended article or source will now be accompanied by a short justification for why Google thinks it might make a good fit, allowing users to adjust their feeds to better reflect their preferences. Despite a host of improvements to Google’s news app, there are downsides to a feed that is constantly refreshing itself with personalized content. This technique provides readers with news they want to read, which doesn’t always coincide with the news that’s most important. A phenomenon known as the “filter bubble” on Facebook recently received backlash after many users realized they were being exposed to news that mainly reinforced their worldview. Google says its AI recommendation stream “gets better the more you use it,” but that may create its own kind of bubble. The update is now available on Android and iOS, and a web version has launched as well. More From The Verge Sand's End Facebook won’t call itself a media company.

Smart Smiley constantly analyzes what Google Allo users are typing and draws up a changing lists of emoji to help users get creative with their conversations. According to Google's blog, people only use about three percent of the total emoji stock on average. This leaves literally hundreds of characters languishing in the obscurity of deep keyboard pages. Smart Smiley lets users break away from these limited patterns and explore the full range of emojis and stickers. Google Allo will now come with the Smart Smiley button on the keyboard.

SEND ANOTHER EMAIL CLOSE share How a 1-Way Trip to New Zealand Led an Ex-Googler's Startup to Pay it 'Forward' 2.0K Dylan Martin - Staff Writer, Tech 11/17/16 @2:51pm in Tech 11/17/16 @2:51pm Grant Burgess had it pretty good after graduating college in 2008. He had landed a job at Google's Boston office, where he started out working on the company's small business solutions team. But after moving up to become a relationship manager for Google's agency business development team and reaching his fourth year, he realized he wasn't finding a lot of meaning at work. "It was just not the place for me to be a happy, healthy person," Burgess said. So after quitting, Burgess decided to do some soul-searching and bought a one-way ticket to New Zealand. From there, a serendipitous meeting led him to work for his first actual startup. Then, eventually, he came back to the U.S. to start his own. The Boston startup is called Forward.gift, and it operates on a very basic principal: gratitude. The idea, Burgess said, is if you feel grateful for someone in your life, you can go to his startup's website to email them a gift, free of cost. Related Mike Volpe Joins Fast-Growing Cybersecurity Startup as CMO The gifts come in the form of vouchers for free items at local businesses, such as a free coffee at Commonwealth Cambridge. New users start out with one free gift, and if they sign up for Forward's newsletter, they are given five new free gifts to give out every month. Participating businesses, which cover the cost of the vouchers, currently include Fajitas & 'Ritas, Gracenote Coffee, Kwench Juice Café, Beacon Hill Athletic Clubs and Pawsh Dog Boutique, among others. "The best thing you can do is express gratitude to others and we don't do it enough," said Burgess, who added that he did a lot of research into positive psychology. "We’re in a culture where we’re always in it for ourselves. I think there's a huge gap between the way we’re meant to be and the way we actually act, and I think that everyone wants to be happy." When I used Forward to send a free coffee voucher to my wife one day in October, it seemed to have the desired effect Burgess is looking for. "You made me happy-cry," my wife told me an instant message after getting the email. The best thing you can do is express gratitude to others and we don't do it enough. Burgess said the idea for Forward came after he worked for GenieWallet, the startup he joined in New Zealand. Like Forward, GenieWallet operated in the small business space, and its main appeal was giving people dollar rewards for shopping at local businesses. One of the things you could do with your GenieWallet rewards balance was gift some or all of it to your friends. From that, Burgess had his eureka moment: "What if there's nothing in it for us but the point of giving a gift?" "That opened up the pay-it-forward model" for his startup," Burgess added. Forward is still in its early stages and completely bootstrapped so far, Burgess said. One way he's aiming to raise awareness of his website is by designating Sunday, Nov. 20, as "Boston Gratitude Day" and holding an hour-long gathering at noon at Boston Common, where there will be live music and apple cider donuts. With consumers paying nothing to send gifts to friends, family and colleagues, there's the inevitable question of "how can it all be free?" The way Burgess describes it, the way Forward can eventually make money is by becoming a word-of-mouth marketing service for small businesses. While bringing in revenue isn't his goal right now, small businesses could eventually pay to offer free vouchers that consumers can give away as a way to get people in the door. For now, Burgess said, his main goals are to test the how consumers use the site and to get more local businesses on board. FILED UNDER: News, Small Business, First Look Related News What Tech Co.

For starters, they're all make-believe - and invented by the same man. Decision 2016 Trump brings transition team to NJ Trump agrees to settle Trump University lawsuits A high school student weighs in: Why Clinton lost Paul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he's British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. "South Park" lawsuit last year. But in recent months, Horner has found the fake-news ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential: In March, Donald Trump's son Eric and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, even tweeted links to one of Horner's faux-articles. His stories have also appeared as news on Google. In light of concerns that stories like Horner's may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, the Washington Post called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. Question: You've been writing fake news for a while now - you're kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I'd call it hoaxing or fake news. You'd call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? Answer: Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore - I mean, that's how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn't care because they'd already accepted it. It's real scary. I've never seen anything like it. Q: You mentioned Trump, and you've probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? A: My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything - they'll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist. Q: Why? I mean - why would you even write that? A: Just 'cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that's just insane. I've gone to Trump protests - trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it. I thought they'd fact-check it, and it'd make them look worse. I mean that's how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it's false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters - they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he's in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels (bad). Q: You think you personally helped elect Trump? A: I don't know. I don't know if I did or not. I don't know. I don't know. Q: I guess I'm curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election - especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs - why didn't you stop? Why keep writing? A: I didn't think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn't messing them up as much as I wanted - but I never thought he'd actually get elected. I didn't even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should've seen this coming - everyone assumed Hillary (Clinton) would just get in. But she didn't, and Trump is president. Q: Speaking of Clinton - did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson's, for that matter? (Horner's Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.) A: No. I hate Trump. Q: Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that "no joke ... in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it's the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans." That makes it sound like you've found targeting conservatives is more profitable. A: Yeah, it is. They don't fact-check. Q: But a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right? A: It's great for anybody who does anything with satire - there's nothing you can't write about now that people won't believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff - like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line - and people went along with it! Q: Facebook and Google recently announced that they'd no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? A: This whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense - like, you wouldn't believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense. I know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I'll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I'd be OK. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from (advertising on fake news sites) for them to just get rid of it. They'd lose a lot of money. But if it did really go away, that would suck. I don't know what I would do. Q: Thinking about this less selfishly, though - it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you're describing are pretty scary. A: Yeah, I mean - a lot of the sites people are talking about, they're just total BS sites. There's no creativity or purpose behind them. I'm glad they're getting rid of them. I don't like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do - I spend more time on it. There's purpose and meaning behind it. I don't just write fake news just to write it. So, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they're listing, and I'm like - good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I'm glad they're getting rid of those sites. I just hope they don't get rid of mine, too.

Orlando-based virtual reality expert Richard Terrell weighs in on news that AMD, which employs 150 here, has been on a roll lately and why VR's emergence will help them. Marco SantanaContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel AMD sees surge from news that Google will adopt its microprocessors Advanced Micro Devices has seen its stock surge more than 25 percent this week after the tech giant Alphabet announced it would use the company's processors in its Google platform. AMD, a global microchip designer that employs about 150 in Orlando, saw its stock close at $6.97 per share Tuesday evening before it began its climb, which has taken its share price as high as $8.76 on Thursday before closing at $8.46. The surge shows that the company's efforts based in Orlando have been resonating, spokesman Drew Prairie said. "AMD's recent success, including our improved financial performance which has been reflected in our rising stock price, is a clear indication that there is growing demand for the types of high-performance graphics products that our Orlando engineering team helps create," he said. As more companies jump into technologies such as virtual reality, which requires high-speed processors to mimic reality on a device, the sector has seen a boost in demand. AMD, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has been battling for control of the microprocessor market with Intel and Nvidia — rivals who have been competing for decades. A Jon Peddie Research study released this week found that AMD holds 13 percent of the graphics processor market — up from August, when it held a 12.3 percent share. Intel remains the dominant player, holding 70.9 percent of the market share in the latest release. Nvidia holds 16.1 percent.

Translating word-by-word often leads to hilarious gaffes like this sign, but there’s a better way. That better way is all about context, which is the focus of a major update that Google just delivered to Google Translate. To deliver translations that better maintain their meaning after Google does its thing, they tapped the power of their neural network. Google has been investing heavily in machine learning for a number of years. In September, they announced that they were almost ready to deliver Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to the masses. English and Chinese were the first pairings offered up, and now they’ve expanded to include French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish. That’s enough to cover roughly 35% of all the queries that are submitted to Google Translate right now. That also means that if you’re looking to have some fun by forcing Translate to cook up some badly-mangled conversions that you’ll need to stick to the non-NMT languages. The big difference between NMT and the old method (phrase-based) is that NMT processes whole sentences. That results in much more natural translations. Google Translate’s machine-assisted translations are actually getting quite close to what a skilled human translator would suggest. They’re particularly good at handling English/Spanish and French/Spanish. Chinese is a close third, which is impressive. Chinese/English is generally considered to be “a notoriously difficult language pair,” according to Google’s NMT research team. Just take a quick look at the sign again for confirmation on that one.

Using Google, students are able to collaborate and have access to tools that allow them to research smarter. "This has truly been a great collaborative project that has both the students and fourth grade teachers excited!" said fourth grade teacher Patricia Perhavec. Google Classroom is part of a set of apps including Gmail, Docs, Drive, Sheets, Slides and Drawings that connect the students and teachers, wherever they are, through the St. Michael School domain. "The students have been enjoying Google Classroom," said Google Certified computer teacher, Linda Merk. "When we tell them it's time to shut down their computers, many students respond with 'class is over already?'"

So when something container-related comes out of Google you'd be wise to take a look — the company knows what it's talking about. For more information on Data Center Management and Monitoring Why Lenovo for Hyperconverged? Partner Offers That's particularly true of Kubernetes, the open-source container cluster management system that was designed at Google before being handed over to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes aims to provide a platform for automating deployment, scaling and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. That's how it describes itself. We might call it a container management system. There's been just one problem with Kubernetes — up till now there's been complaints that it's been spectacularly difficult to get up and running. This may explain in part why so many container management systems have hit the scene that are based on Kubernetes but which also offer a proprietary overlay of software to make the system easier to deploy and run (as well as delivering other features.) Making Kubernetes Easier to Install and Use It's something the project has been acutely aware of, according to Aparna Sinha, a product manager at Google who works on Kubernetes. "One of our top user requests has been making Kubernetes itself easier to install and use," she says. And so the good news. "We've taken that feedback to heart," says Sinha. How? The latest version of Kubernetes, version 1.4, was released at the end of September. And in it is the fruit of the labors of over 20 contributors who came together to greatly simplify the Kubernetes user experience, according to Sinha. Improvements have been made throughout the system, including installation, startup, certificate generation, discovery, networking, and application deployment. Perhaps the biggest innovation is the introduction of a new tool called "kubeadm," which provides a way for users to provision nodes, install Kubernetes and boot strap a cluster on a public cloud, a private cloud, or on a bare-metal cloud. It reduces bootstrapping to two commands, with no complex scripts involved: once Kubernetes is installed, "kubeadm init" starts the master while "kubeadm join" joins the nodes to the cluster. Installing Kubernetes has also been made easier by packaging Kubernetes with its dependencies on major Linux distros, including Red Hat's and Ubuntu Xenial, so it's possible to install Kubernetes with little more than an "apt-get install" or a "yum install." As Google well knows, cloud-native applications are often built to run in containers. But existing applications don't always make easy bedfellows with containers. In particular, stateful applications like databases or ones that use batch processing don't always play nicely, but in Kubernetes 1.4 there are a number of new features designed to make deploying stateful applications less traumatic. An example is ScheduledJob, which has been introduced (albeit in Alpha release) so users can run batch jobs at regular intervals. And Init-containers (Beta release) addresses the need to run one or more containers before starting the main application — for example, to sequence dependencies when starting a database or multi-tier app, Sinha says. Other New Features and Enhancements in Kubernetes 1.4 There's also a feature that enables cluster administrators to expose multiple storage provisioners and allows users to select them using a new Storage Class API object. Kubernetes 1.4 also adds curated and pre-tested Helm charts for common stateful applications such as MariaDB, MySQL and Jenkins, which will be available for one-command launches using version 2 of the Helm Package Manager. There's more in the update too, including the ability to build applications with clusters that span regions and clouds, security enhancements including support for the AppArmor security system, and a new Kubernetes dashboard UI that has 90% CLI parity. Of course, there's no shortage of container management systems to choose from these days: Rancher, Docker Swarm, ContainerX, Mesosphere Marathon, Azure Container Service, CoreOS's Tectonic, which is built on Kubernetes, and even Google Container Engine, which is also built on Kubernetes, to name but a few. Many of these container management mongers push the story that Kubernetes is too raw and difficult to use by itself, and that you'd be better off using something with a proprietary finish to take the edges off Kubernetes. While they may have a case, with version 1.4 Kubernetes is showing its working hard to address this issue.

CST November 17, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST A Google Docs file is spreading across the internet after both Facebook and Google announced their goals to combat fake news. Melissa Zimdars, an assistant profess at Merrimack College, created the document which includes news sites that are either fake, misleading, or satirical in nature. The document has popped up in the Los Angeles Times, Forbidden Hillcrest, and even on Reddit. One of the sites that is on the list, Inquisitr, even wrote an article on it. Inquisitr claimed that sites like Raw Story and GlobalResearch.ca have already been removed from the list, citing that there may already be a backlash against the list from some publishers. Zimdars puts the news sites into four categories. Category one deals with sites that rely on "outrage culture", using distorted headlines or misleading information. Category two are sites that "circulate misleading and/or potentially unreliable information." Category three is for more click-bait type websites that still deliver questionable information. And category four deals with satires news site like The Onion. The satires sites are included into the list because Zimdars thinks they sometimes contribute to the cycle of misinformation. The list includes sites like Info Wars, Occupy Democrats, Project Veritas, and Breitbart News. Recently, Breitbart's former executive chairman, Steve Bannon, was named as President-elect Donald Trump's chief strategist. Zimdars also gives tips to avoid what could potentially be a fake news site. She said that sites that end with ".com.co" tend to emulate real news sources. "Watch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story," she said. "Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event." While she calls out sites like The Daily Kos, The Huffington Post, and Fox News for having the same problems as some of the sites on the list she doesn't include them. Those sites, she said, can and do offer up legitimate news coverage. She also said that it's best to read multiple news sources on one issues that way you can get a variety of viewpoints. This also helps for you to not get trapped in an echo-chamber of news that may be slanted or skewed. Zimdars is continually updating the document, meaning she may add more sites or remove any or all of the sites that are currently compiled on the list.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us TWRP now available for the Google Pixel, Pixel XL By John Hoff - November 17, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter It must have crossed your mind, this question of when we will be able to flash a custom ROM on a Google Pixel. Of course, stock Android 7.1 Nougat is wonderful and all that, but the innate curiosity of Android users will probably get the better of them in the end. We’ve just taken a step closer to custom ROMs on a Pixel with TWRP releasing their custom recovery for Google’s new flagship phones. Team Win Recovery Project, or just TWRP for those who use it, has been the go-to custom recovery for Android users and tweakers since they took over the mantle from ClockworkMod because of their easy-to-use, easy-to-learn touch-based interface. A custom recovery is essential for flashing 3rd party software into an unlocked Android device, and we now just got TWRP for the Pixel phones. Installing TWRP on to a Google Pixel phone will be a bit different since the file system is primed for Nougat’s “seamless updates”. To make sure you are following the correct instructions, check out the source link at the bottom of this article. Follow it to the letter, if you don’t want to brick your expensive Google Pixel phone. TWRP developer “Dees_Troy” also outlined things that could go wrong, again available at the source link below. Since this is an “alpha” build, there are bound to be things that will go wrong, so we recommend you take extreme care of your valuable data and follow installation instructions to the hilt.

AWS, which has become an increasingly important segment of Amazon's operations, continues to dominate the IaaS business with a 45 percent share of the global market, which is more than twice that of the next three competitors combined -- Microsoft, Google and IBM. "It's very important to Amazon," said John Dinsdale, who wrote the report for Synergy. "It is a key growth driver for the company overall, and it is also a foundation technology and service that underpins Amazon's business lines." In the public PaaS market, the level of competition is much stronger; however AWS still holds firm, with well over 30 percent of the market. The other three major competitors -- Salesforce, Rackspace and IBM -- have slightly more market share when combined. Amazon Sets Tone Amazon has dominated by getting well out in front of the competition and being aggressive with both pricing and new technology that keeps AWS well ahead of its nearest competitors, who got into the game relatively late. After 10 years in the market, Amazon has assembled more than 1 million customers in 190 countries around the world. AWS doubled operating income to US$861 million the third quarter, compared with $428 million a year ago, on sales of $3.2 billion, compared with $2.09 billion in the year-ago quarter. The firm has assembled a major roster of customers, including leading technology firms like Intuit, Netflix, IMS Health, Splunk and others. A major advantage Amazon has developed over the competition is its global infrastructure reach, with 38 availability zones across 14 geographic regions worldwide. The company just announced plans to open another nine zones, including in Canada, the UK, France and China. IBM Leads Private Cloud Market IBM resides at the top of the managed private cloud segment, according to Synergy, with just under 20 percent of the market. The next three competitors -- AWS, Rackspace and NTT -- own about 20 percent combined. However, IBM's ranking in the Synergy report is questionable, according to Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "No one else I know includes IBM in the top four cloud providers for all segments," he told the E-Commerce Times. IBM reported $8.9 billion in technology services and cloud revenue for the third quarter, compared with $8.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company reported a 45 percent jump in strategic imperatives revenue, driven mainly by increased hybrid cloud services performance. IBM was named the top firm in terms of hybrid cloud environments in an August report from Technology Business Research. Cloud revenues industry wide are well over $8 billion per year, Synergy estimated, with strong growth of more than 50 percent per year.

Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, the Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, made the disclosure in a statement in Lagos. “Google search in the just concluded week from Nov. 9 to Nov. 16, was filled with intrigues from internet users. “People went online to learn more about Donald Trump, the newly-elected president of U.S., and Wole Soyinka’s response to the news of his winning the presidential election was also a burning issue. “Also searched is TB Joshua’s rather ‘uncertain’ prophecy, and some other exciting stories,” he said. Kola-Ogunlade said that the internet trolls decided to haunt Nigeria’s Nobel Laureate, Soyinka by bringing up his pledge to tear his green card if Donald Trump emerges as America’s president. “Soyinka, who made the statement at Oxford University, was caught in crossfire by critics and agonists, who asked him to put his words into action. “The Laureate responded to his accusers in a long article, schooling them on figures of speech and language use. “This week on Google, Donald Trump shocked the whole world to emerge as the 45th president-elect of the U.S., to ‘trump’ Sen. Hillary Clinton,’’ he said.

He said that the controversial Pastor, TB Joshua, founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), also became a ‘dramatis personae’ in the American elections when he predicted that ‘a woman’ would win. “Tables turned on him when Donald Trump emerged as winner. “Joshua came out to suggest his prophecy was misinterpreted, by referencing the final results where Clinton won ‘the vote of the majority of Americans,” Kola-Ogunlade said. He said that the death of world-famous Canadian singer, Leonard Cohen, who died in his sleep following a fall in the middle of the night, at his home in Los Angeles, also got attention online. “The 82-year-old Cohen was known for songs like “Hallelujah, Bird on the Wire, and Suzanne. “His 14th album, `You Want It Darker’, was released last month,’’ Kola-Ogunlade said. Other issues that got the attention of internet users are the announcement of the one-week warning strike by Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). The former National Security Adviser, NSA, retired Colonel Mohammed Sambo Dasuki, who did not attend his father’s burial was also a topic of discussion. Other searches which topped Google search include Jumia’s Black Friday promotional deals to buyers for the 12 days began last week, the Nigeria vs Algeria World Cup Qualifiers with Nigeria winning 3 – 1. Also featured online was the crash of the Canadian Immigration website as American search how to move to Canada with Donald Trump’s victory and the historic first meeting of Michelle Obama and Melania Trump. Google Trends was launched in May, 2006, to allow people to see popular issues in terms of searches, trending on Google over a period of time. - NANFor the latest on national news, politics, sport, entertainment and more follow us on Twitter and like our Facebook page. - NAN Tags nigeria wole soyinka national NEXT ON NEWS24 NIGERIAX Senate uncovers governors', minister’s imported luxury cars in Lagos 20 November 2016, 17:02 share: &nbps; Read more from our Users Submitted by Bethel Tanifo Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, ...

 Google just made a very smart hire in its quest to topple Amazon in the cloud Matt Weinberger Nov. 17, 2016, 1:43 PM 7,322 facebook linkedin twitter email print Sam RamjiScreenshot/YouTube Google has hired Sam Ramji, the CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, to serve as a senior executive under Google Cloud boss Diane Greene, Business Insider has learned. Cloud Foundry is an increasingly popular technology in programmer circles, providing developers with a set of tools that help them deliver code at the same breakneck pace and tremendous scale as Google or Facebook. As CEO of the non-profit foundation that oversees the project, Ramji is a very visible figure in that community. Prior to the Cloud Foundry Foundation, Ramji served as Chief Strategy Officer of Apigee, a publicly-traded company that Google recently snapped up for $625 million. Even after stepping down from his executive role, Ramji remained as advisor to Apigee.  And before Apigee, Ramji spent 5 years as a Microsoft executive, from 2004 to 2009, helping refine their outreach to software developers. At Microsoft, Ramji's job was to oversee the company's efforts around open source technologies like the free Linux operating system — during a period when the company was still wary of any non-Microsoft tech. All of which to say that Ramji has been around the block a few times when it comes to building technologies that appeal to developers.  Google head of Machine Learning Jia Li, formerly of Snapchat.Twitter Given that Google Cloud has been looking to win a lot of support from those same developers as it works to compete in the cloud with the leading Amazon Web Services, Ramji is a smart hire that can talk the talk and walk the walk with customers. Indeed, Google has been on something of a roll with its cloud hires: Earlier this week, the search giant announced that it had hired away one of Snapchat's top artificial intelligence experts to bolster Google Cloud. As for the Cloud Foundry Foundation, it's promoted Abby Kearns, formerly the head of strategy, to Executive Director, to replace Ramji. Chip Childers will serve as CTO. Google confirmed Ramji's hire to Business Insider, but declined to offer additional details.  SEE ALSO: THE END TIMES ARE HERE: Microsoft embraces Google, Apple, Samsung and even Linux in one go NOW WATCH: Here's how Facebook and Google's new 8,000-mile deep sea data cable will work Loading video...

It's been a splashy year for Google's cloud platform, following the hiring of VMware co-founder Diane Greene last November to run the business. In addition to aggressive pricing and a big rebranding effort, Greene's strategy to chase down Amazon Web Services has centered around partnerships with key players in the business world. On Thursday, Google and Intel said they're working together on technology to help enterprises securely move data to the cloud. By linking up with Intel, Google is following through on its plan to lure businesses that have been reluctant to embrace the cloud. Customers don't have to think about it as a wholesale shift, but rather can count on an existing vendor — Intel — to help guide them. Despite Google's advances, AWS still controls the market. According to Synergy Research Group, AWS' share of the cloud infrastructure market sits at 45 percent, while Microsoft, Google and IBM have less than 20 percent combined. At the end of the second quarter, Google had only 5 percent of the market, according to Synergy. And while virtually all emerging companies and new applications are being developed in the cloud, only 41 percent of all enterprise workloads are running in a public or private cloud, according to 451 Research, with the rest still sitting in data centers on premises. By mid-2018, that number will be up to 60 percent. In teaming up with Intel, whose chips power traditional servers, Google can layer in software that simplifies the process of migrating data from their own machines into the cloud and back as needed. Google's homegrown Kubernetes technology allows developers to package information in virtual containers to make it movable and accessible from more places and a multitude of devices. "You just can't pick up and move every workload," said Nan Boden, head of global alliances at the newly branded Google Cloud, in an interview. "You have to come up with an architecture that makes it practical for these companies to be able to take advantage of these new technologies in the cloud and new economics in the cloud." Revenue from public cloud services, including software and infrastructure, is expected to more than double to $195 billion by 2020 from $96.5 billion this year, according to IDC. Google Cloud previously partnered with Autodesk on technology for entertainment companies to quickly render 3-D images and with Okta to help businesses securely deploy Google Apps. In an interview with CNBC.com in May, Greene said that she's "super partner-oriented." Google and Intel aren't disclosing if there's a revenue split in the products they're developing. Raejeanne Skillern, vice president of Intel's data center group, said the partnership is focused on serving clients' needs and creating technology that's secure and accessible. In addition to Kubernetes, another Google product that Skillern is excited about is TensorFlow, software that brings machine learning tools into more applications. "This is definitely groundbreaking for our work with Google," Skillern said.

We reported back in April that this feature would be on the way in the near future, and now it has rolled out in US desktop and mobile search. Here is an example of what it looks like: We launched a nifty feature on Google Search that shows when (and on what channel!) you can watch your favorite show or movie. 🙂 pic.twitter.com/KhEfYcI879 — Satyajeet Salgar (@salgar) November 15, 2016 As you can see, after searching for the name of a show Google will display when it will be on TV soon. Google provides the date, time, channel, and episode number. There are no immediate plans to expand this feature to other markets, but Satyajeet Salgar says the company would ultimately like to broaden the availability. Since I live in Canada I haven’t been able to experiment with the feature personally, which is unfortunate because I have some unanswered questions. For example, what happens if you search for a show during its off-season? Will Google tell you that the show is not currently airing, or will the box simply not display? Will Google be able to pick up air dates for a show if it’s being syndicated on a local network? Or does it only pick up major networks? If anyone feels like feeding my curiosity by finding out the answers to those questions, I would be much obliged. I will also update this post with the new information. A Threat to Other TV Listing Sites? When we first heard about this feature back in April, one of my immediate thoughts was that this is going to be a considerable threat to sites like TV Guide and others in that niche. However, Google makes decisions based on what is best for searchers, and its hard to deny the convenient of the new TV listings box. Online searches for TV shows are becoming a big deal, especially on mobile. Google has stated searches for TV shows and films on mobile are up than 55 percent over the past year. When more searchers take notice of the new TV listings box, it’s possible that number could grow by even more next year.

Sam Lubell Design Date of Publication: 11.17.16. 11.17.16 Time of Publication: 12:56 pm. 12:56 pm Google’s A-Team Architects Will Shape Its New London HQ Google Bjarke Ingels Group and Heatherwick Studio—the same design firms working on Google’s Mountain View, CA headquarters—are now moving ahead on the company’s new London offices. Unlike most of Google’s buildings, this one will be vertical—a 10-story structure that the two firms describe as a cross between a Silicon Valley startup garage and a London train shed. “We’ve tried to create an interestingness that fits the scale and the community of King’s Cross,” the two firms noted in a statement released this week, of a project they say “couples clarity with eccentricity and anchors innovation with heritage.” Google wouldn’t let the design firms comment directly, but a massing model released by BIG shows a wedge-shaped building that abuts John McAslan’s lacy, semi-circular addition to the King’s Cross train station’s Western Concourse. In recent years a massive redevelopment has transformed King’s Cross, on London’s North Side, into a burgeoning urban hub that includes 50 new buildings, 10 new parks, and 30,000 new residents. It’s a central part of London’s so-called Knowledge Quarter, which includes 75 research and innovation organizations within a mile radius of King’s Cross. BIG and Heatherwick’s new edifice will be Google’s first purpose-built structure outside the United States. (The company often reuses existing structures.) It joins a growing Google campus at King’s Cross, which will eventually include three offices and house 7,000 employees in more than 1 million square feet of space. BIG And like most of Google’s buildings, it’ll likely be designed to keep those employees around as long as possible. A scrapped plan for the site by London-based AHMM featured rooftop gardens meant to encourage employee lounging, eating, and relaxation. An interior rendering of the new office shows a multi-level, open work space warmed by wood walls, internal plantings, and natural light. Google has at times struggled to fit into new neighborhoods, its force of money and culture overwhelming its locality and driving up rents. It’s hard to say what impact it will have on this rapidly evolving part of London, but it’s tempting to look to Heatherwick’s other King’s Cross development, Coal Drops Yard, for clues. The firm transformed the former coal yard into a canal-side shopping area by stitching together two 19th century buildings by their curved, gabled roofs. This respect for history, combined with an audacious willingness to create something utterly new, is likely to be echoed in BIG and Heatherwick’s plans for Google. Both design firms are experts at nailing a place’s aesthetic. Whether they can do the same for its culture remains to be seen. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

You often don’t know where to look for one and in many situations reject the restrooms you do stumble on because they’re too unhygienic. Google’s now come up with a solution to this in the form of a Toilet Locator feature. As per International Business Times India, Google’s collaborating with the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) to launch the new Toilet Locator within Google Maps. The basic mission of the project is to help citizens across India find the nearest and cleanest lavatories in their vicinity. Google’s restroom radar facility is apparently going to be piloted in the National Capital Region (NCR) sometime between November 16 and 30. This will be in keeping with the MoUD’s Swachhata Pakhwada or Cleanliness Fortnight celebrations. The work for the NCR region is supposedly almost done and will be available in Google Maps within a fortnight. Also See: Google’s new PhotoScan app turns your old prints into digital images Officials from the ministry spoke about the Google tie-up under the condition of anonymity, stating that it would cover public toilets, metro stations, malls, hospitals, and petrol pumps. To get started, you’ll have to fire up Google Maps and search for keywords like toilet, swach, lavatory, shauchalay, shulabh, and swachhata. Interestingly, Google’s seemingly going to allow people to rate loos based on factors like whether or not it’s clean. It appears the system will be heavily reliant on crowdsourcing and the subsequent feedback the feature will get. The program is set to be scaled up across the nation to reach 2041 urban local bodies (ULBs) eventually. Other than trying to solve the clean toilet dilemma facing Indians nowadays, Google has also launched a brand new ‘Find an ATM near you’ search option on its local home page to help you get through the currency crisis. Clicking on the link takes you to Maps and pins down all machines located nearby.

GoodGopher.com, which I created and launched over a year ago, indexes all the independent media websites that are right now being targeted by radical left-wing totalitarians who despise America and want to silence the free press. A left-wing hate professor named Melissa Zimdars, of Merrimack College, a discredited institution reviled by its own students, is among the many totalitarians on the left who are right now trying to SILENCE conservative, independent websites like Breitbart.com, Infowars.com and NaturalNews.com. The totalitarian left, which systematically traffics in false information, rigged news stories and highly deceptive social engineering tactics disguised as news, decided recently to label all independent news websites "fake news." The only "real" news, they claim, comes from organizations like CNN, a group of unethical presstitutes who abandoned journalism long ago to push the election of Hillary Clinton, an international war criminal who sold out the U.S. uranium supply to the Russians. To the totalitarian left, you see, the only news that's "real" is their progressive propaganda. Everything else, no matter how well investigated or documented, is labeled "fake." They've even labeled Project Veritas videos "fake" even though James O'Keefe is truly one of the few remaining real journalists in America. GoodGopher.com was designed from the start to be an independent search engine that's free from corporate corruption and government propaganda. The site indexes thousands of independent news sites and scans them daily for new articles and posts. News sites that are not yet included, but wish to be, can submit their site at this link. Being indexed is free. Not an all-purpose search engine: Best for NEWS searchesImportantly, GoodGopher.com is not an all-purpose search engine. It doesn't cover the entire web. Its focus is independent news and information, including conservative, libertarian and freedom-oriented sites. It's also important to note that all ranking criteria are universally applied to all sites in the index. In other words, there is no "bonus" in the rankings for my own sites such as NaturalNews.com or NewsTarget.com. GoodGopher.com is a level playing field that ranks every included site using the exact same methodology, producing results that are based 100% on merit, not "search cronyism." Try it now with the following searches, all of which are banned, censored or artificially suppressed by Google: Hillary Clinton seizures Bayer war crimes Vaccine injuries All the sites being banned or punished by Google are welcomed to get listed in GoodGopherGoogle hates the truth. Google is a corrupt, dishonest search engine run by fanatical leftists who directly colluded with Hillary Clinton to skew the election in her favor. They are literally forming an Orwellian "Ministry of Truth" propaganda machine that deliberately favors LIES over TRUTH. This is their intent! Furthermore, Google has banned all truthful news sources from Google News, leaving it as nothing more than an index of leftist propaganda featuring all the mainstream media liars you've come to know: CNN, Huffington Post, MSNBC and so on. Many people are already recommending DuckDuckGo.com as an alternative to Google, and I agree that's a great alternative for a general purpose search. But DuckDuckGo, for all we know, may start censoring all the truthful, independent news websites at any day. To my knowledge, the site hasn't committed anything to protecting free speech or truthful, independent news. But GoodGopher.com is run by my company, and my credentials for protecting free speech and supporting independent media are unassailable. For almost two decades, I've battled against the unapologetic lies of the mainstream media, and since I take money from no one (no Google money, no government money, no investor money, no bank money), I can call all my own shots. That means I'm 100% dedicated to honest, independent media and the power of free speech to achieve universal freedom for humankind. Alternatives to leftist totalitarianism are already on the riseI run GoodGopher.com at a loss, by the way. It loses money every month. But I'm going to keep it running because it is rapidly becoming one of the very last remaining ways to search for truthful, independent news. As the totalitarian leftists increasingly censor independent media websites, Google will first cut off their revenues, then Google will simply blacklist them all from its search index. Facebook will ban them, and Twitter will delete all the "alt right" accounts it doesn't like, all in an effort to stifle dissent and destroy the voices of reason in a society made half insane by lunatic leftists. As that is happening, an "alternative" universe of internet technology companies will rise up, offering solutions for search, videos and social media. Seen.life is one such example, and it already has something like 200,000 social media users. There's also Gab.ai and other social sites coming online in 2017. Here at Natural News, we're working on an improved video solution to make Youtube irrelevant, and we're also studying ways to improve GoodGopher's search engine results. The truth cannot be silenced. We the People shall overcome all the censorship, hate and lies of the totalitarian left. We will work together to defend the First Amendment, Second Amendment, and all the human rights described in the Bill of Rights. In fact, we are now living in a society where the dishonest political left is imploding by the hour, with CNN losing viewership at an accelerating rate, and Google losing users by the millions. Even ESPN, which has adopted a lunatic leftist progressivism cultural stance, is losing subscribers by the millions as people drop cable subscriptions. The NFL is imploding, too, and nobody believes anything they read anymore in the NYT or Washington Post. The revolution for human freedom has begun!

Online database of psychiatric drug-linked shootings launched by the Health Ranger... PsychDrugShooters.com About the author:Mike Adams (aka the "Health Ranger") is a best selling author (#1 best selling science book on Amazon.com) and a globally recognized scientific researcher in clean foods. He serves as the founding editor of NaturalNews.com and the lab science director of an internationally accredited (ISO 17025) analytical laboratory known as CWC Labs. There, he was awarded a Certificate of Excellence for achieving extremely high accuracy in the analysis of toxic elements in unknown water samples using ICP-MS instrumentation. Adams is also highly proficient in running liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and mass spectrometry time-of-flight analytical instrumentation. Adams is a person of color whose descendents include Africans and American Indians. He self-identifies as being of American Indian heritage, which he credits as inspiring his "Health Ranger" passion for protecting life and nature against the destruction caused by chemicals, heavy metals and other forms of pollution. Adams is the founder and publisher of the open source science journal Natural Science Journal, the author of numerous peer-reviewed science papers published by the journal, and the author of the world's first book that published ICP-MS heavy metals analysis results for foods, dietary supplements, pet food, spices and fast food. The book is entitled Food Forensics and is published by BenBella Books. In his laboratory research, Adams has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice protein products imported from Asia to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food science researcher to document high levels of tungsten in superfoods. He also discovered over 11 ppm lead in imported mangosteen powder, and led an industry-wide voluntary agreement to limit heavy metals in rice protein products. In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or vastly improve their nutrition. Through the non-profit CWC, Adams also launched Nutrition Rescue, a program that donates essential vitamins to people in need. Click here to see some of the CWC success stories. With a background in science and software technology, Adams is the original founder of the email newsletter technology company known as Arial Software. Using his technical experience combined with his love for natural health, Adams developed and deployed the content management system currently driving NaturalNews.com. He also engineered the high-level statistical algorithms that power SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, a massive research resource featuring over 10 million scientific studies. Adams is well known for his incredibly popular consumer activism video blowing the lid on fake blueberries used throughout the food supply. He has also exposed "strange fibers" found in Chicken McNuggets, fake academic credentials of so-called health "gurus," dangerous "detox" products imported as battery acid and sold for oral consumption, fake acai berry scams, the California raw milk raids, the vaccine research fraud revealed by industry whistleblowers and many other topics. Adams has also helped defend the rights of home gardeners and protect the medical freedom rights of parents. Adams is widely recognized to have made a remarkable global impact on issues like GMOs, vaccines, nutrition therapies, human consciousness. In addition to his activism, Adams is an accomplished musician who has released over a dozen popular songs covering a variety of activism topics.

After a strong push into machine learning and AI earlier this week, Google has announced a strategic alliance with Intel to increased enterprise cloud usage. The two companies have already been working for many years on engineering and validating data center processor technology and are now expanding the collaboration to accelerate the use of cloud technology in the enterprise. Specifically, Google and Intel will help enterprise businesses move existing infrastructure to the cloud. These efforts include joint advertising efforts, technical education, and technology integrations. Of course, there is a focus on machine learning and optimizing TensorFlow performance on Intel processors, as well as improving the security between Intel hardware and the Google Cloud Platform. The full areas of focus are below: Kubernetes – Optimizing Kubernetes for Intel architecture to support a broad range of workloads. Intel is a major contributor to the Kubernetes ecosystem and enables enterprises to run OpenStack as a managed Kubernetes workload. Intel and Google engineers have already delivered code optimizations that have improved feature transparency on Intel architecture. This work is also expected to improve workload capabilities, including virtual network performance and prioritization of shared resources. Machine Learning – Accelerating TensorFlow performance on Intel processors, for example by allowing TensorFlow to leverage all CPU cores and vector lanes for improved parallelism, integrating high-performance libraries such as the Math Kernel library (MKL) into TensorFlow, and optimizing memory allocation and data layer operations across a range of topologies. IoT – Creating a secure platform for connecting Intel’s IoT edge devices to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), where the data can be analyzed to inform better decisions — a critical capability for industries like retail and manufacturing. Security – Enhancing security integrations between Intel hardware and GCP infrastructure that will further improve security for enterprise customers.

Qualcomm is manufacturing its next-generation mobile processor, the Snapdragon 835, in a partnership with Samsung, the companies announced today. The two are increasingly rivals when it comes to chips for smartphones and tablets, but Qualcomm said it chose Samsung to produce the Snapdragon 835 in part because the Korean tech giant is the first to offer 10nm chip fabrication. Although Samsung uses Snapdragon processors in some of its devices, including the flagship Galaxy S7, it also makes its own Exynos-series mobile chips. "This collaboration is an important milestone for our foundry business as it signifies confidence in Samsung's leading chip process technology," Samsung's chip foundry head, Jong Shik Yoon, said in a statement. The 10nm fabrication process allows mobile chips to deliver either 27 percent higher performance or 40 percent lower power consumption. Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 835 is in production now and expected to ship in commercial devices in the first half of 2017. Qualcomm today also revealed the next generation of its Quick Charge technology for smartphones and tablets, one week after Google strongly encouraged Android manufacturers to ditch Quick Charge and other similar technologies over compatibility concerns. Quick Charge 4 will be 20 percent faster at charging devices and includes new protections against battery overcharging. It will start to show up in consumer devices in early 2017, Qualcomm said. Last week, Google criticized third-party charging technologies for modifying the voltages of Android-powered devices beyond default levels, explaining that they may interfere with its own USB Type-C quick charging technology. Google's USB Type-C specification requires between 4.45 and 5.25 volts, while Qualcomm Quick Charge typically uses 9 or 12 volts. Qualcomm said new power-management controllers in Quick Charge 4 make it compatible with any high-voltage power source, including Google's USB Type-C specifications. "Quick Charge 4 is compatible with this requirement in that it uses the Power Delivery method to negotiate for higher voltage," Qualcomm Senior Director of Product Management for Quick Charge Ev Roach told PCMag. //Related Articles Google Slams Proprietary Fast Charging on Android Devices In April, Qualcomm issued a statement that said it has "received no reports of user experience or device malfunction issues with or without USB Type-C connectors." There are more than 100 Quick Charge-compatible mobile devices and more than 300 unique accessory products such as wall and car adapters, battery packs, and docking stations. In total, Qualcomm said, over 600 million mobile devices and accessories support Quick Charge technology. For most devices, Quick Charge 4 will provide up to 50 percent battery charge in 15 minutes or less. By comparison, Google's own fast charging on the Pixel XL lets you charge the phone to 35 percent in 30 minutes, and fully in 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Technology experts have reacted positively to Google Earth VR, but more than a couple have pointed out that they get headaches after using it for too long.

Cloud Foundry Foundation CEO Sam Ramji departs for Google Posted Nov 17, 2016 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Mozilla launches Firefox Focus, a private web browser for iPhone Sam Ramji, the founding CEO of the open-source platform as a service Cloud Foundry Foundation, is joining Google in a yet-to-be-disclosed executive role. Abby Kearns, the current VP of Industry at the Cloud Foundry Foundation and an industry veteran, will take over as Executive Director while Chip Childers will become the organization’s CTO. Ramji is leaving Cloud Foundry at a time when open source is becoming increasingly important in the enterprise. It’s unclear what exactly his role at Google is going to be, but chances are it will involve Cloud Foundry in some form. Over the last few years, Cloud Foundry has found its niche in large enterprises, after all, and that’s exactly the market Google is currently trying to attract to its own public cloud platform. Ramji tells me we will have to wait until Monday to hear more details, though (“Cloud Foundry is pretty damn important to the Google Cloud Platform,” is all I got out of him). It’s worth noting that Google also recently acquired Apigee, a company where Ramji was Chief Strategy Officer from 2009 to 2015. The Cloud Foundry Foundation board appointed Ramji as CEO in early 2015. Before joining the Cloud Foundry Foundation earlier this year, Kearns worked on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and at Verizon. Her job now is to steer the project and build upon its current momentum. “Abby reminds me of Tron, in that she fights for the user,” Ramji said. Childers spent 18 years working on large-scale computing projects before he joined the foundation as its Technology Chief of Staff in 2015. “As we’ve thought about where we want to go for 2017, we’re going to focus on doubling down on the work we’ve been doing with CIOs and CTOs with our enterprise customers and help them be successful,” Kearns told me when I asked her about her goal. She also noted, however, that the foundation plans to go after the developer community more. “If you attended our events in the past, you haven’t seen much of the narrative in sessions and even keynotes directed at developers,” she said. Going forward, the foundation’s events and its messaging will include far more developer-centric discussions. The reason why the foundation didn’t quite do this before is because a lot of the traction Cloud Foundry got in the last few years came from the C-suite. Childers echoed this and added that the companies that have adopted Cloud Foundry now often find themselves struggling to find the talent necessary to operate their platforms and write applications for them. The foundation plans to soon launch a certification program to help ease this issue. Childers also noted that the project needs to ensure that its tools fit into the complex IT setups that many of these enterprises already operate today. To this, Kearns added that as enterprises move their Cloud Foundry experiments into production, the project will also need to ensure that it can meet their scaling needs. Looking ahead, Ramji told me that he would like to see more end user-focused companies as foundation members going forward and he believes that it will be pivotal for Cloud Foundry to add service certifications, too, especially as the Cloud Foundry ecosystem continues to grow. He also argued that for Cloud Foundry, adoption is currently ahead of awareness, so the foundation’s job going forward will be to bring more balance to this.

A blocked Thai website shows a notice from Thailand's Ministry of Digital Economy and Society with the message, "This website contains content and information that is deemed inappropriate. It has been censored by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society."  (The Associated Press)   By The Associated Press Thu., Nov. 17, 2016 BANGKOK—Thai authorities cracking down on online insults to the royal family following the recent death of their king pressed Google and Facebook for help as they shut down 1,300-plus websites last month — more than they had in the previous five years combined, according to records released exclusively to The Associated Press. While the nation has collectively grieved since the Oct. 13 passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the government has also focused on eliminating online remarks it deems offensive to the late monarch, his queen or his heir-apparent, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. Thailand’s lese majeste law, the world’s toughest, makes defaming any of the three a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Since the king’s death, Thailand has charged more than 20 people with making anti-royalty statements, requested deportations of suspects from at least seven countries and attempted to wipe out content it finds offensive from websites and social media. “The amount of content restricted in Thailand under these laws is absolutely of concern, particularly as the lese majeste provisions are used to stifle legitimate dissent, both through blocking and content removal,” said Madeline Earp, who researches Asian internet censorship for the non-profit Freedom House. The military says the lese majeste law is necessary to safeguard the monarchy and national security. Article Continued Below Data compiled by the Ministry of Defence’s support group and released to the AP shows that the government shut down 1,370 websites in October, more than the 1,237 shut down in the previous five years. Just two had been shut down in September. Thailand orders the country’s internet service providers to block offensive websites. Users who click on them see only a government seal and a statement in Thai: “This website contains content and information that is deemed inappropriate. It has been censored by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society.” Deputy Prime Minister Prachin Chantong said the government has set up a team to quickly control online content. “Thais have been attacked by websites that twist the truth,” Prachin said. The approach is different for Google, Facebook and other online and social media platforms based outside of Thailand. Prachin said he has contacted those companies and asked them to monitor and remove content that could insult the monarchy. Prachin said Google and Facebook agreed. Both companies dispute that, and say they are only responding to complaints brought to them rather than actively seeking content offensive to the monarchy. “We have never provided account information or content of any Facebook user to the government of Thailand, nor do we proactively monitor people’s content or conversations for potential violations of local law,” Facebook spokesman Tim Inthirakoth said after his company met with Prachin on Thursday. Google said that last year it removed 1,331 items at the request of Thai authorities, up from 74 items in 2014. Facebook said it had five requests related to criminal cases in 2015 and didn’t produce data for any of them. Facebook and Google refused to release how many requests they’ve had since the king’s death, saying they will publish that in their regular biannual online reports. Thailand has long censored online content deemed insulting to the monarchy, but has done so more frequently since a military coup ousted an elected government in late May of 2014. According to the Ministry of Defence data, the junta censored 974 websites in its first two years, more than three times as many as the prior government censored in its last two years. Thai authorities are thought to be particularly concerned with websites with content about Vajiralongkorn, the 64-year-old designated heir to the throne who lacks the popularity of his father. The public at large has long traded rumours about Vajiralongkorn’s finances, hot temper and other matters. Three stormy marriages are a matter of public record. But critical news reports from abroad about Vajiralongkorn are commonly blocked in Thailand. Thailand remains sombre in many ways more than a month after the death of Bhumibol, who was 88 and the world’s longest-reigning monarch. Millions continue to dress in black or white every day, boisterous events have been cancelled and mourners are flocking by the tens of thousands to pay their respects at the Royal Palace. Online, for the first 30 days many websites and Facebook pages were also without colour. Even Google’s trademark red, green, blue and yellow search box was, in Thailand, simply monochrome. Daphne Keller at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society said internet companies doing business in countries with laws restricting speech know they will be expected to comply with the rules. One common means of doing so without deleting lawful speech elsewhere is to offer country-specific versions of services, like YouTube Thailand, said Keller. “The company can then honour national law on the version of the service that is targeted to, and primarily used in, that country,” she said. Emma Llanso, who directs the Free Expression Project at the Washington, D.C., based Center for Democracy and Technology, said internet companies have to grapple with how to respond when told to shut down websites. “This is a perfect example of the kinds of conflicts that make it difficult to protect freedom of speech in the digital age,” she said.

For starters, they're all make-believe - and invented by the same man. Related News/Archive Trump White House could boost Tampa defense industry, experts say 3 Days Ago Mark Zuckerberg outlines Facebook's ideas to battle fake news 18 Hours Ago Former Trump girlfriend says New York Times article was 'spun' to make Trump look bad (w/video) 6 Months Ago Paul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he's British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. "South Park" lawsuit last year. But in recent months, Horner has found the fake-news ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential: In March, Donald Trump's son Eric and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, even tweeted links to one of Horner's faux-articles. His stories have also appeared as news on Google. In light of concerns that stories like Horner's may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, The Washington Post called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. Q: You've been writing fake news for a while now - you're kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I'd call it hoaxing or fake news. You'd call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? A: Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore - I mean, that's how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn't care because they'd already accepted it. It's real scary. I've never seen anything like it. Q: You mentioned Trump, and you've probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? A: My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything - they'll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist. Q: Why? I mean - why would you even write that? A: Just 'cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that's just insane. I've gone to Trump protests - trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it. I thought they'd fact-check it, and it'd make them look worse. I mean that's how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it's false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters - they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he's in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels (bad). Q: You think you personally helped elect Trump? A: I don't know. I don't know if I did or not. I don't know. I don't know. Q: I guess I'm curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election - especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs - why didn't you stop? Why keep writing? A: I didn't think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn't messing them up as much as I wanted - but I never thought he'd actually get elected. I didn't even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should've seen this coming - everyone assumed Hillary (Clinton) would just get in. But she didn't, and Trump is president. Q: Speaking of Clinton - did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson's, for that matter? (Horner's Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.) A: No. I hate Trump. Q: Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that "no joke ... in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it's the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans." That makes it sound like you've found targeting conservatives is more profitable. A: Yeah, it is. They don't fact-check. Q: But a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right? A: It's great for anybody who does anything with satire - there's nothing you can't write about now that people won't believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff - like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line - and people went along with it! Q: Facebook and Google recently announced that they'd no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? A: This whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense - like, you wouldn't believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense. I know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I'll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I'd be OK. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from (advertising on fake news sites) for them to just get rid of it. They'd lose a lot of money. But if it did really go away, that would suck. I don't know what I would do. Q: Thinking about this less selfishly, though - it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you're describing are pretty scary. A: Yeah, I mean - a lot of the sites people are talking about, they're just total BS sites. There's no creativity or purpose behind them. I'm glad they're getting rid of them. I don't like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do - I spend more time on it. There's purpose and meaning behind it. I don't just write fake news just to write it. So, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they're listing, and I'm like - good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I'm glad they're getting rid of those sites. I just hope they don't get rid of mine, too. Facebook is under fire for failing to rein in fake and biased news stories that some believe may have swayed the presidential election.

Created using neural networks, the software gets better as it goes along and works in a similar way to handwriting recognition software GOOGLE SHOW AND TELL  Google’s recently introduced a new Show and Tell picture recognition algorithm that can automatically caption images. According to the firm, the AI can now describe images with nearly 94 per cent accuracy and may even ‘understand’ the context and deeper meaning of a scene. Last month, Google released the open-source code for its image captioning system, allowing developers to take part, the firm revealed on its research blog. The AI was first trained in 2014, and has steadily improved in the time since. Now, the researchers say it is faster to train, and produces more detailed, accurate descriptions. Built by Jonas Jongejan, Henry Rowley, Takashi Kawashima, Jongmin Kim, with friends at Google Creative Lab and Data Arts Team, the challenge is part of Google's newly released AI Experiments site. The site includes a number of machine learning experiments including one that enables users to take a picture of something to find out how it's said in another language.  The idea is anyone can try out the experiments, while the site also encourages coders to submit their own.

The software uses image recognition software to label was its the pictures and then turns these into lyrics.  One of the experiments uses machine learning to map sounds which can then be made into beats thanks to a drum sequencer.  Another creates a sonic map of birdsong relying solely on supplied audio. Continuing the musical theme, one of the experiments uses neural networks to create a map of notes and timings and will then then respond when the users plays just a few notes.  One of the developments enables people to see what neural networks like Google's Deep Dream see, through their web cam.   Read more: Quick, Draw!

It’s one small part of a vastly expanded suite of color adjustments added to Google’s built-in photo editor, and at first I couldn’t understand what it was for. It did nothing when I swung it back and forth on my indoor shots of avocados and headphones. But then I tried it on a photo with some sky in it and wow! What Google’s put together is essentially a vibrance slider dedicated to the color blue. If you have a daytime sky, even a wintry one like in my photo below, this thing will saturate the blue to a rich, summery shade in a hurry. Same goes for any waterscapes or other blue-rich pictures in your collection that could do with a boost. I’ve messed around with the "Deep blue" setting on most of my outdoor shots, and it frankly works too well. There’s no real cost to using it, the image quality isn’t degraded and the rest of my colors are left untouched (obviously there’s some fringing and imperfections in the sample photo I provide, but that’s why it’s a slider and not a binary toggle). The temptation is to just give each image a perfect sky, but then what’s the point of taking a photo if I’m going to turn it into some idealized simulacrum through Google’s infinitely powerful tools? With so many filters available from so many sources — Google Photos, VSCO, Instagram, Twitter, Flickr, and practically every other photo app in existence — it takes real discipline for me to just leave an image alone. When I do, it’s unsatisfying at the moment when I have cravings to tinker, but it always ends up more rewarding in hindsight, giving me the most realistic recreation of what was actually happening. You appreciate and value memories more once they start fading. Realism takes a backseat to prettiness in most people’s imaging preferences, and Google is serving that demand This is what troubles me about where Google’s going: perfect photos result in imperfect memories. Ever since the launch of Google+ and its "auto awesome" photo functions, Google has been pursuing all sorts of software-based ways to optimize and prettify mobile photographs. I think the company’s made amazing strides toward that goal, and I’m now in geeky love with the Pixel XL because of its sophisticated computational camera system that lets me take sharper and more detailed photos with the help of a ton of complex mathematics. But realism isn’t Google’s priority. Google knows most of us would rather have things looking pretty than realistic, and it’s producing tools to achieve that. This "Deep blue" slider is just another incremental step to really lovely and cheery pictures coming out of every phone. That’s fine, that’s cool, but I think I’ll exercise my discipline and leave at least a few of my photos looking as bleak as the real world is.

Matt Kamen 3 days ago By Matt Kamen Thursday 17 November 2016 Google Google is massively expanding its Google Earth product – and turning it into what could be the gateway drug to virtual reality for millions. ADVERTISEMENT Like the regular Google Earth, the virtual reality version lets you tour some of our planet's most breathtaking locations, making it possible to experience places you might never otherwise visit. Google Read more When AR takes over we will all rent virtual diamonds and have AI personal shoppers at home When AR takes over we will all rent virtual diamonds and have AI personal shoppers at home By Liat Clark The project takes things to the next level though, allowing you to walk around the likes of the Hong Kong Stadium or Rome's historic Colosseum, or climb the Matterhorn. Having been rebuilt for room scale VR though, this revamped Google Earth also lets you soar around them, flying through the air for first-person views that are almost impossible in real life. Google It's a truly global spectacle too – you can fly into orbit and examine the Earth as a celestial body. You can zoom in and out of anywhere on the planet, rotate the globe on its axis, and transport to points of interest. Knowing that the Earth itself is pretty big (196.9 million square miles), Google has also built in curated tours, with cinematic excursions around some of the most popular and breathtaking locations. Google ADVERTISEMENT "Ten years ago, Google Earth began as an effort to help people everywhere explore our planet. And now, with more than two billion downloads, many have," said Mike Podwal, product manager at Google VR, in a blogpost. "Today, we are introducing Google Earth VR as our next step to help the world see the world." The software, available now via Steam for free, is currently exclusive to HTC Vive. Other platforms – unconfirmed, but likely to include Oculus Rift – will follow next year. With Google having just launched its own Daydream VR headset, we wouldn't be surprised to see a mobile version come along, too.

Maybe it isn't a coincidence then, that after the well-received launch of the first made-by-Google phones, OnePlus snuck in an incremental end-of-year upgrade to the OnePlus 3. Let's compare the new OnePlus 3T to Google's Pixel XL. Size The Pixel is a smidge taller and wider, but sizes come out very similar. Weight Like the OnePlus 3 before it, though, the 3T is 6 percent lighter than the Pixel XL. Build Nothing out of the ordinary here: Both phones have aluminum unibody designs. Colors One of the handful of changes in the OnePlus 3T is that it ships in a new gunmetal color. Display size Both have spacious 5.5-inch screens. Display resolution The Pixel XL has a terrific display that comes out 33-percent sharper than the OnePlus 3T's. Display type No change from the OnePlus 3 here: Both of these use AMOLED panels. Processor This is one of the key upgrades from the OnePlus 3 to the 3T, as it jumps from the Snapdragon 820 (early 2016) to the new (late 2016) Snapdragon 821 – same as the Pixel. RAM OnePlus put an industry-leading 6 GB of RAM in both the 3T and 3. Storage OnePlus 3T doubles the Pixel's storage on the entry-level tier, and adds a 128 GB option that wasn't available for the OnePlus 3. MicroSD Neither phone gives you the option of expanding that internal storage. Battery Another big upgrade in the 3T, the new model has almost as big a battery as the Pixel XL. But the OnePlus 3, which had a 12-percent smaller battery than the 3T, already scored higher than the Pixel XL in our battery benchmark (thanks in part to its lower-res display). Logics suggests the 3T will widen that gap even further. Fast charging Both phones, like all Android flagships, have fast-charging tech. OnePlus, though, is advertising that its "Dash Charge" can better maintain high charging speeds while doing intensive tasks like watching video or playing games. Camera megapixels OnePlus updated the front camera in the 3T, but not the rear. Unless you need poster-sized selfieds, though, that may be trumped by the Pixel XL having the best smartphone camera we've used. Camera aperture (rear) The Pixel pulls off this feat, despite having "only" ƒ/2.0 aperture. The secret is Google's HDR algorithms, which quickly and automatically combine a variety of shots into one. Water resistance Neither phone has any meaningful water resistance. Virtual assistant The Pixels launch (exclusively) with Google's new Assistant, the next evolution of the old Google Now, which OnePlus is stuck with. VR Speaking of exclusivity, the new Google Daydream VR platform is currently tied solely to the two Pixel phones. Hi-Fi audio This year we saw LG and HTC phones add DACs (digital-analog converters) and high-res Bluetooth (AptX and AptX HD) support, to cater to the Hi-Fi audiophile crowd. Neither of these phones does that. Fingerprint sensor OnePlus' fingerprint sensor is on the home button, while Google's is on the backside. Software Both run Android Nougat. Google's version is 100-percent pure and will always be up-to-date with the latest version, while the OnePlus 3T runs a near-stock customization dubbed Oxygen OS. Release OnePlus is putting the 3T up for sale on November 22. Starting price (full retail) With a better camera, Google Assistant and completely-stock Nougat, the Pixel XL is likely the better phone. But is it US$330 better? OnePlus' flagships keep creeping up in price, but the constant is that they've all provided terrific value. We'll reserve final judgment for our full review, but so far that appears to be the case with the 3T as well. For more you can check out New Atlas' review of the Pixel XL.

Mi Box is an affordable 4K HDR streamer, but dragged down by Android TV Posted Nov 17, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Sprinklr acquires Little Bird, a tool for finding experts on anything via Twitter The Mi Box is Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi’s play to take on devices like Roku, Apple TV, Android TV and Fire TV. Priced at only $69, and sporting features like integrated Google Cast and voice search, the 4K- and HDR-supporting device seems worth a look. But at the end of the day, Mi Box is still an Android TV player, and subject to limitations of that platform — which are many. At a Glance: Quad-core 2GHz ARM processor 2 GB RAM and 8 GB storage (expandable via USB) Bluetooth remote with voice control 4K video support at 60 FPS The Mi Box is quite thin. This roughly 4 x 4-inch matte plastic device is only about a quarter-inch thick. That’s smaller than the Apple TV, Fire TV and Roku’s higher-end boxes, though I’m not convinced that people buy streamers largely for their portability. (Or, when portability is a concern, they probably opt for a stick or dongle like Amazon Fire TV Stick or Chromecast.) On the back of the Mi Box is a power port, USB (which can support adding storage or Ethernet via an adapter), and a 3.5mm headphone jack that also can be used to connect to external speakers. Included with the device is the power cord, HDMI cable and a simple Bluetooth remote. Set-up Getting started with the Mi Box was not the most seamless experience, but, to be fair, set-up tends to be one of the more frustrating aspects to configuring any new device. img_1230 img_1231  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit An on-screen animation prompts you to press a button on the remote to get going, but some accompanying text would be helpful. (After all, why are they moving both thumbs to press a single button? Is their finger over the circular home button or the volume up? The diagram could be more clear). You then step through a fairly standard series of Android TV configuration questions, like language, Wi-Fi network, location services switched on… oh, and you’re cool with giving Google your personal data and letting it download updates as needed? Great. There’s an option to use your Android phone or tablet to simplify set-up, or you can visit a URL on your phone and enter a code. (The webpage didn’t work on my iPhone, though. You could enter the code, but not click through.) Alternatively, you can sign in to your Google account directly on-screen. There’s an extra level of hell for anyone using two-factor authentication that involves typing in your Google account email and password, then having to type it in again after Mi Box realizes you’ll need to go through a different authentication flow. Yay. Thank goodness set-up is a one-time affair. Remote The Mi Box remote isn’t cluttered with buttons, which mostly is a good thing. As to whether you like the choice to use the directional pad over player controls (play/pause, rewind, fast forward) may come down to personal preference. But the built-in volume controls are great to have. There’s also a power-off button, which is different. I tend to leave my Roku on all the time for the lovely background images, but you might like having the option to put your box to sleep when not in use. Just be careful — when my mind wandered, I once hit the power button out of habit, because Roku’s home button is also at the top. That was fun. User experience People may be compelled to buy the Mi Box because it delivers 4K/HDR streaming at a lower price point than rivals like Roku’s 4K-ready Premiere ($80, 4K), Premiere+ ($100, 4K/HDR) and Ultra ($130, 4K/HDr), or the high-end NVIDIA Shield ($200). Meanwhile, Mi Box will support 4K Ultra HD and the HDR10 standard (the latter, enabled from Android N and onwards). But it is user experience that truly makes someone love their device, and being built on top of Android TV has pluses and minuses. On the upside, Google has great voice recognition capabilities and it’s handy to be able to kick off a voice search with just a press of a button on the remote. You can search for content beyond simply naming a title or actor you want to seek out. For instance, you can ask to see “Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar movie,” or questions like who played a certain character in a film. With voice commands, you can also launch apps, change channels, search the web, go to some TV shows and movies directly and more. You even ask non-TV related questions, like what’s the weather, or (as my kid likes to do), basic factual questions, like “how far is the moon?” (It’s a trick she picked up from Alexa.) Navigating using the remote, though, is snappy. You can move quickly through selections and by holding down on the directional remote, you can fly across the on-screen items. This is (unfortunately) especially handy, since the rows of apps you install are laid out in long, horizontal rows across the home screen. Apps also load quickly, and games ran smoothly. (Note that Mi Box supports external game controllers, but this was not included with the review unit. ) mi-box_10 mi-box_01 mi-box_05 mi-box_02 mi-box_04 mi-box_08 mi-box_03 mi-box_06 mi-box_09  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Unfortunately, Android TV has its downsides. If you’re fine with being a bit locked into the Google ecosystem, you may not mind the fact that there’s no way to access Amazon’s content library or Prime Video, or that the “recommendations” at the top promote everything Google, like YouTube videos or Google Play Movies & TV, alongside a bunch of tips like “How to cast.” The Mi Box also ships with an annoying row of “Mi Box Recommends” app links. This includes a bunch of standard fare, like Netflix, Sling TV, Vudu, Pandora, HBO Go, Hulu, CBS All Access, VLC and others. But you can’t delete this row, and to remove an app from this row you have to first install it, then uninstall it. Meanwhile, though Android TV supports most of the major streaming apps, to install them you have to visit the Google Play store from the device. Apple TV, by comparison, organizes apps into categories as part of its larger user interface design. Then there’s the problem with navigating in and out of apps. While hitting the “back” button may exit you out of YouTube after some clicks, for instance, doing the same with Netflix takes you to its settings screen. This is a minor issue, perhaps, but one that can have you hesitating when mindlessly mashing your remote control. Another feature that seems great in theory, but fails in practice is Android TV’s Live Channels. The idea here is to give you an easy way to tune into live television programming served up via apps. However, there are only a few apps that support this right now, like Pluto.tv, but not the major players like Sling TV or PlayStation Vue. And when you start the live channel, then return to the home screen, the video keeps playing. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out how to shut the video off beyond entering, then exiting, another app. Why Mi Box? The market for Mi Box comes down to wanting to cater to tech enthusiasts who are already looking for a 4K or HDR streamer and are intrigued by the lower price point. Apple TV doesn’t yet support 4K, and Roku’s options are more expensive. But on that latter front, you get what you pay for. On Mi Box, you’re on your own to find 4K content across apps that support it, like Netflix, YouTube, Vudu, UltraFlix and Sony’s Ultra streaming service. Roku’s software, on the other hand, highlights where to find and watch 4K video. There’s also the fact that, at the end of the day, this is Android TV. Enthusiasts may see this as an advantage over Apple’s more closed ecosystem. On Mi Box, you can sideload apps, like Kodi, for instance. But you can do this on Amazon Fire TV, as well, which supports 4K, has Alexa and is getting a refreshed user interface. Android TV has been largely forgotten in the streaming media race, and there’s a reason for that. It’s an unfinished — and way too Google-y — experience. If you’re going for platform lock-in, it’s hard to choose Android TV over Apple’s better-designed Apple TV. Or for those who want to stay in the Android universe, Amazon Fire TV seems a better choice. That said, given its price point for 4K and HDR, and its availability both in Walmart stores and on Walmart.com, Mi Box will likely make its way into a number of U.S. consumers’ homes in the months ahead. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Xiaomi Founded 2010 Overview Xiaomi Inc. manufactures and distributes mobile phones and consumer electronics.

China’s Baidu – often referred to as the Google of China – is also developing self-driving cars. The company has now started testing its autonomous cars on public roads in the People’s Republic. It’s running public tests with actual passengers on board. The tests have already transported more than 200 people in a 2 mile stretch of road located in the tourist destination of Wuzhen. The company says that this road has been “mapped with centimetre accuracy.” Baidu’s self-driving cars are fitted with millimeter wave radar, Velodyne LiDAR, several video cameras as well as a powerful computer that’s capable of processing all of that data. The car is capable of driving itself, negotiating intersections, switching lanes, passing slower cars and even making U-turns. It can drive itself up to a maximum speed of 37 miles per hour which is the speed limit in that area. As with all public tests of self-driving cars, a human driver is present behind the wheel at all times should something go wrong, but that doesn’t mean it necessarily will. There’s also a display inside the car which shows passengers information about traffic and objects along the way as they take a ride in a car that can drive all by itself. Baidu is shooting for the first commercial self-driving cars powered by its technology to hit the roads in China by 2018. It wants to achieve mass production by 2021. Filed in Transportation.

Menu Home Events Library Jobs Topics Newsletter Search Commercial Residential Tech Design Products Green Econ Legal/Regs Infrastructure Corp Brief Google unveils plans for massive London headquarters Author By Kim Slowey @kimslowey • Published Nov. 17, 2016 Dive Brief: Google has revealed its plans to establish a new London headquarters near the city's iconic King's Cross station, according to Business Insider. This will be the company's first such campus built outside the U.S. and is expected to create at least 3,000 new jobs by the time it is completed in 2020. Google currently employs approximately 4,000 people in the U.K. Google currently operates out of a 380,000-square-foot leased space in London and is scheduled to move into another leased space in 2018. In addition to these buildings, the new headquarters will include a 10-story, 650,000-square-foot Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG)- and Heatherwick Studios-designed building, resulting in approximately 1 million square feet of space, according to Building Design + Construction. Dive Insight: At a time when many businesses are leaving the post-Brexit U.K., Google said it's "very optimistic" about the future of its U.K. business, although the decision to leave the European Union may have complicated its plans for the longer term. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the U.K. is a worthy investment because of the innovation taking place there, in addition to its skilled workforce and educational opportunities in the area of computer science. Google spent $1.6 billion on the land, which it purchased several years ago, but it shelved those plans for a new headquarters in search of a better option. As far as Brexit's effect on the overall U.K. construction industry, it now faces the prospect of higher building costs and a deepening of the current skilled labor shortage, as E.U. tradesmen will no longer automatically be able to work in the U.K. In addition, the fate of non-British managers and design professionals, estimated to represent 40% of Britain's AEC payroll, is up in the air. BIG also designed Google's new 600,000-square-foot building near its Mountain View, CA, headquarters. The building has been described as a "futuristic circus tent" because of a unique, opaque cover. The building will house 3,000 additional employees and tie into its existing campus.  The new structure also includes photovoltaic solar panels for renewable energy, clerestories for natural light, native landscaping and bird-friendly design elements.  Recommended Reading: Engadget Google unveils new plans for its London HQ Business Insider Google plans to open a new British HQ and create 3,000 more jobs Building Design + Construction Bjarke Ingels Group and Heatherwick Studios confirmed as architects for Google’s new London Headquarters Follow Kim Slowey on Twitter share tweet post email print Filed Under: Commercial Building Design Corporate News GET THE TOP NEWS Select Newsletter: Construction Dive Topics covered: commercial, infrastructure, design, green, regulation, and more.

AI 'Singularity' May Take A While, Google Executive Says By Clark Mindock @clarkmindock On 11/17/16 AT 10:07 AM Close In the world of science fiction, robots given artificial intelligence often play a menacing role capable of killing human beings either on their own volition or at the behest of their programmers. Think movies like “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Blade Runner” or even "I, Robot," for instance. However, even with all of the recent advances leading to an increasing daily reliance on artificial intelligence, the prospect of technology running the show and outpacing humans may still be a long ways off, a Google executive said this week. “There is a lot that machine learning doesn’t do that humans can do really, really well,” Diane Greene, Google’s senior vice president of cloud businesses operations, said Tuesday at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco. “Nobody expected some of the advances we are seeing as quickly as we’re seeing them but, the singularity, I don’t see it in my sentient lifetime.” Related Stories Google To Remove MacBook Pro With Touch Bar's Ad-Skipping Feature? This AI Robot Isn’t As Smart As Your Baby Greene’s comments came in response to a question wondering how far off “the singularity” — which refers to the prophesized moment when artificial intelligence surpasses that of humans— is. They also came just hours after Google hired a group of leading experts in artificial intelligence onto its team. As shown by Google making those recently announced hires, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly important component for businesses that rely on the technology to quickly extract insights from large data sets that are stored in the cloud. In addition to Google, other technology companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are competing in the market to provide the service to companies and consumers. Businesses and investors alike have noted that improving technology is an important part of long-term planning. AI offers the ability for companies to quickly adapt to new and unexpected challenges as well as new questions that may arise. “You don’t plan for the highest likelihood scenario. You plan for agility,” Vinod Khosla, a venture capitalist, said earlier this week. Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Since few of us will ever manage to see all the world's most stunning sights, Google is offering users the opportunity to explore the planet from the comfort of their own homes. All that's required is a virtual reality headset -- the HTC Vive is the only model currently compatible -- and a specially dedicated application called Google Earth VR. The system takes users on a fully immersive virtual flight above planet Earth, taking in big cities and landmarks, as well as sites of exceptional natural beauty, all from a bird's eye view. Google Earth VR lets users cover 196.9 million square miles (510 million km2), with a wealth of places to visit and hours of entertainment in a truly exceptional experience. The app even includes a selection of cinema-style tours, taking in the Swiss Alps, the Grand Canyon and the Amazon River. For the moment, only lucky owners of the HTC Vive VR headset can enjoy this application, available to download free via the Steam game platform. This isn't the first time that Google has launched a HTC Vive exclusive, as Google Earth VR follows the Tilt Brush VR painting app, which landed earlier this year. The HTC Vive is one of the most accomplished VR headsets on the market. It sells for $799. Note that Google Earth, which launched more than 10 years ago, has already been downloaded two billion times (across all operating systems).

Snap’s Spectacles address nearly all of Google Glass’ shortcomings, but will they achieve mainstream adoption? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 17, 2016 at 8:33AM Snap's Snapchat recently started selling its Spectacles -- glasses with a built-in camera for video capture -- in vending machines. However, the $130 device has been tough to find since the "Snapbot" vending machines are as ephemeral as Snapchat's vanishing pictures -- they only stay in a single location for 24 hours before disappearing, and Snapchat only announces the next location 24 hours in advance. Image source: Snap Inc. It's a clever marketing strategy which has generated lots of hype. Wired reports that people were lining up in the L.A. area to buy the Spectacles, and that they quickly sold out. Shortly afterwards, reports claimed that scalpers were selling the device for as much as $5,000 online. Customers seem much more eager to buy Spectacles than Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Glass -- but will this initial momentum help it succeed where Glass failed? Why Google Glass failed To see if Spectacles can succeed, we should remember why Google Glass failed. First, the "Explorer" version of Glass cost a whopping $1,500 -- limiting its appeal to affluent gadget enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers. Second, the device looked awkward, and hiring acclaimed designer Diane von Furstenberg to make them more fashion-friendly didn't help. Google also tried to add smartphone-like apps to Glass' heads-up display, but many were implemented poorly and ran slower than they did on regular smartphones. It was also unclear who Glass was designed for. Instead of promoting the device for practical uses in education, law enforcement, or construction, Google advertised it as a device for capturing experiences from a first-person view akin to GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) action cameras. However, GoPro cameras were cheaper and more durable, and captured much higher-quality images and videos than Glass. Google also didn't realize that people didn't like Glass "Explorers" wandering into public areas and staring at them. Since there was no visible indicator of whether or not photos and videos were being captured, businesses banned Glass users from their establishments. Google issued etiquette guidelines for Glass to counter the backlash, but the device was so widely mocked that it was finally discontinued last year. Google Glass. Image source: Google. Why Spectacles might succeed To sell Spectacles, Snap is leveraging something that Google lacked -- a growing social networking presence. Between June 2014 and June 2016, Snapchat's daily active users soared from 59 million to 150 million. With that reach, especially among millennials (about 70% of its user base, according to eMarketer), Snap has the clout to expand its ecosystem with new software and hardware products. Snap also seems to have done its homework regarding Glass' shortcomings. Spectacles come in much cheaper at $130, and the ephemeral vending machine strategy generates much more hype than Google's Explorer sign-up program. The Spectacles also look like wacky toys instead of serious tech devices -- which may make them more socially acceptable. Its case, which doubles as a charging dock, is also more innovative than Glass' basic USB charging cable. Instead of featuring a wide variety of mediocre apps, Spectacles only does one thing -- take first-person Snaps. Most importantly, the device alerts bystanders by lighting up while capturing content, eliminating the creepiness factor of Google Glass. Snap isn't the only one to learn from Glass' failure In hindsight, it's easy to see Google's mistakes with Glass. But other companies besides Snap are clearly learning from its failure.  Sony (NYSE:SNE) subsequently promoted its SmartEyeglass AR headset to enterprise users instead of mainstream consumers. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) made its "mixed reality" HoloLens headset a tethered PC-based device for productivity and entertainment instead of a free-roaming AR one to be worn in public. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also reportedly testing out a pair of AR glasses for mainstream consumers, and might address Glass' shortcomings in the same manner as Snap. It's unclear if Spectacles will succeed where Glass failed, and Snap probably won't release any hard sales figures for the device. But the initial demand and buzz indicate that it's off to a strong start, and it may finally pave the way for AR glasses to gain mainstream approval.

News World Americas Facebook fake news writer: ‘Trump is in the White House because of me’ The man responsible for many of this year's viral political hoaxes thinks he may have swung the election Caitlin Dewey @caitlindewey Thursday 17 November 2016 14:55 BST Click to follow The Independent US Trump meets outgoing President Barack Obama in Washington What do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they’re all make-believe - and invented by the same man. Paul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he’s British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. “South Park” lawsuit last year. But in recent months, Horner has found the fake news ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential: In March, Donald Trump’s son Eric and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, even tweeted links to one of Horner’s faux-articles. His stories have also appeared as news on Google. Read more Edward Snowden addresses Facebook fake news claims Facebook has a fake news problem. These students solved it in 36 hours BREAKING: the internet Facebook employees 'form secret task force' to purge fake news Google is banning fake news sites from its ad service In light of concerns that stories like Horner’s may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, Intersect called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. This transcript has been edited for clarity, length and - ahem - bad language. You’ve been writing fake news for a while now -you’re kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I’d call it hoaxing or fake news. You’d call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore - I mean, that’s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn’t care because they’d already accepted it. It’s real scary. I’ve never seen anything like it. You mentioned Trump, and you’ve probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don’t fact-check anything - they’ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist. Why? I mean - why would you even write that? Just ’cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that’s just insane. I’ve gone to Trump protests - trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it. I thought they’d fact-check it, and it’d make them look worse. I mean that’s how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it’s false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters - they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he’s in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels [bad]. You think you personally helped elect Trump? I don’t know. I don’t know if I did or not. I don’t know. I don’t know. I guess I’m curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election - especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs - why didn’t you stop? Why keep writing? I didn’t think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn’t messing them up as much as I wanted - but I never thought he’d actually get elected. I didn’t even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should’ve seen this coming - everyone assumed Hillary [Clinton] would just get in. But she didn’t, and Trump is president. Speaking of Clinton - did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson’s, for that matter? (Horner’s Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.)  No. I hate Trump. Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that “no joke... in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it’s the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans.” That makes it sound like you’ve found targeting conservatives is more profitable. Yeah, it is. They don’t fact-check.

It’s great for anybody who does anything with satire - there’s nothing you can’t write about now that people won’t believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff - like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line - and people went along with it! Facebook and Google recently announced that they’d no longer let fake news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? This whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense - like, you wouldn’t believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense. I know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I’ll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I’d be okay. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from [advertising on fake news sites] for them to just get rid of it. They’d lose a lot of money. But if it did really go away, that would suck. I don’t know what I would do. Thinking about this less selfishly, though - it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you’re describing are pretty scary. Yeah, I mean - a lot of the sites people are talking about, they’re just total BS sites. There’s no creativity or purpose behind them. I’m glad they’re getting rid of them. I don’t like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with The Onion. The stuff I do - I spend more time on it. There’s purpose and meaning behind it. I don’t just write fake news just to write it. So, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they’re listing, and I’m like — good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I’m glad they’re getting rid of those sites. I just hope they don’t get rid of mine, too.

Is Google Shutting Down The Accounts Of Users Who Resell Their Pixel Phones? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Is Google Shutting Down The Accounts Of Users Who Resell Their Pixel Phones? November 17, 2016 9:40 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk locked out google google pixel phones project fi Hundreds of people who ordered Google Pixel phones and then resold them are reportedly finding themselves locked out of their Google accounts, potentially causing a lot of headaches for anyone who enjoys having access to their emails, photos, and other files. Members of moneysaving site Dan’s Deals are reporting that they’ve been shut out of their Google accounts over the past few days — that means no Gmail, no Google Drive, no Google Photos, no nothing. Not having access to your primary email could also mean being unable to authenticate sign-in attempts for other accounts as well. About 200 people have reported being shut out, and have received e-mails stating that their data will be deleted if they don’t successfully appeal the suspension. Everyone who has been blocked said they have one thing in common: they bought the Pixel phones through Project Fi and shipped them to the same phone dealer in New Hampshire, who paid them a profit on each phone. There’s no sales tax in that state. There is a warning warning against reselling in Google’s terms of sale, though it doesn’t say what the consequences will be for violating that condition: “You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift.” While yes, you should always abide by a company’s terms if you want to continue using their products, Daniel Eleff, owner of the Dan’s Deal site, thinks Google’s actions are a bit extreme. “I’m not defending those who violated the terms of the sale, but I do think it is heavy-handed for Google to block access to all of their services for doing so,” he writes. “Was violating Google’s phone resale policy really worthy of an effective digital death penalty?” We reached out to Google for comment and more information regarding whether or not Pixel buyers are warned that their accounts may be blocked if they resell the devices. A Google spokesperson told Consumerist in an emailed statement that the company had identified “a scheme in which consumers were asked to purchase Pixel devices on behalf of a reseller, who then marked-up the cost of those devices in order to resell them to other customers.” Google is willing to take pity on some of those folks who are locked out, but not all. “We prohibit the commercial resale of devices purchased through Project Fi or the Google Store so everyone has an equal opportunity to purchase devices at a fair price,” the rep added. “Many of the accounts suspended were created for the sole purpose of this scheme, but since some customers were not aware of these Terms of Sale and are now locked out of many Google services they rely on, we’re restoring access to these customers’ accounts.” Want more stories from Consumerist?

Stevey's Blog Rants Random whining and stuff. Wednesday, November 16, 2016 The Monkey and the Apple It's been a while! I took a couple of years off blogging because I felt I didn't have much left in the way of interesting things to say.  So I've been just been programming, and studying, and learning this and that.  I've been doing a bit of Cloud development, and I taught myself iOS development, and after years in the Google cocoon I poked my head out and learned how people do things in the real world with open source technologies. And lo at long last, after some five years of tinkering, I finally have something kind of interesting to share.  I wrote a game!  Well, to be more precise, I took an old game that I wrote, which I've perhaps mentioned once or twice before, and I turned it into a mobile game, with a Cloud backend. It has been waaaay more work than I expected. Starting with a more-or-less working game, and tweaking it to work on Cloud and mobile -- I mean, come on, how hard can it be, really?  Turns out, yeah, yep, very hard. Stupidly hard. Especially since out of brand loyalty I chose Google's cloud platform, which 3 or 4 years ago was pretty raw.  And let's face it, iOS APIs have evolved a ton in that timeframe as well.  So even as "recently" as 2013 I was working with some pretty immature technology stacks, all of which have come leaps and bounds since then. And now I have all sorts of stuff to share.  Definitely enough for a series of blog posts.  But I also have less time than before, because it's all happening in my non-copious spare time, all late nights and weekends.  And running an MMORPG is a fearsome task in its own right. Incidentally, I've just opened the game up for beta testing, so if you want to try it out while you read along, visit http://ghosttrack.com to request an invite.  You'll need an iPhone, iPad, or iPod running iOS 10.2 (Edit: 9.2!) or later.  I'd love to do Android and PC, but there's only one of me.  For now. So where do I start?  I guess the logical thing to do would be to start at the beginning, but screw all that, I'm starting with the monkey. The Monkey I had the following conversation with my wife the other day. It went something like: Wifey: Baby, I lost all my stuff! (A lot of our conversations have started this way since April, give or take, when she started playing the game.) Me:  What stuff baby? Wifey: (wailing) All the stuff I had in my house!!  I dropped it all there and them boom, it disappeared, right in front of my eyes.  I was watching it and then five seconds later it was gone.  This happened before, and I didn't want to tell you because I wasn't sure, but I just saw it!  It happened! Me:  OK baby I'll come look. Wifey:  See?  It was right there!  I had a lot of good stuff there and it's gone! Me:  (looking around)  I believe you baby. Me:  (looking around some more)  I think... I think the Monkey did it. Wifey:  What monkey?  What!?  That monkey took my stuff? Me:  (checking)  Yep.  It picked it all up and it's carrying it now. Sure enough, her pet monkey had picked up all her precious loot and valuables.  But while she stared in disbelief at this unexpected betrayal, I was worrying about how I was going to get her stuff back.  Because there were two problems. First, the monkey wasn't killable via combat, since I had marked pet creatures in your personal home as non-attackable.  I don't know if that was the best decision ever, but it seemed reasonable at the time.  And second, there was a chance that if I pulled out the big guns and killed it myself, for instance by invoking its kill() method directly at runtime, its inventory (her loot) would be replaced with the default monkey inventory of bananas and fur, or whatever I'd given them. I'm pretty sure that in most states, accidentally replacing your wife's hard-earned treasure with bananas and bits of fur is legal grounds for divorce.  So I was in a bit of a pickle. Wifey: How are you going to get it back?  I can't believe that monkey!  Can you just make it drop it? Me:  Well I could, but the AI will just immediately pick everything up again. Wifey: I worked hard for that stuff!  I can't even remember what I had!  An amulet, a sword, a girdle, all kinds of stuff! Me: Don't worry, baby.  Tap on the monkey, you can see it carrying everything.  Just give me a second to figure it out. The picture below shows the predicament.  Wifey is the naga warrior, I'm the old guy in the blue pajamas, just like in real life, and the monkey is barely visible 2 squares below her, by the Japanese shoji screen. Every creature in the game has an event queue and a command processor, and can respond to generally the same set of commands as players.  Normally the AI decides what commands to give a monster, but you can inject your own commands under the right circumstances, or even take control for a while (e.g. with the Charm Monster spell).  So I decided I'd try to command the monkey to give me the items, one at a time. The game is written mostly in Java, but a good portion (maybe 25%) is written in Jython, which is an implementation of the Python language on the Java virtual machine.  And, usefully, Jython has eval and exec functions for interactive code evaluation.  So I opened up my command interpreter and went to work. > exec monsters = me().map.monsterList Ok > eval monsters [monkey] > exec monkey = monsters.iterator().next() Ok > eval monkey Monkey > eval monkey.inventory The MonsterInventory contains:  - bit of fur (0.06 lb)  - bone (1.5 lb)  - Amulet of Acid Resistance (0.12 lb)  - bag (0.5 lb)  ... So far, so good.  I had a reference to the monkey in my interpreter, and I was seeing Wifey's stolen valuables, plus the expected monkey inventory.  Now for the coup de grace. > eval monkey.commandNow("give amulet to rhialto") > None > Monkey gives you Amulet of Acid Resistance. Woot!  Success.  I had to keep chasing the monkey around, since offhand I couldn't think of a way to make it stand still.  In retrospect I could have paralyzed it, or set its AI to the stationary AI used for immobile monsters.  But I couldn't be bothered to look up how right then, since I hadn't ever been in a situation quite like this before, and my wife was alternating between indignation, amused disbelief, and near panic over her stolen stuff. I had a mechanism for getting the items back, so I just followed the monkey and issued those commandNow() instructions. Unfortunately, and to my lasting surprise, the monkey started ignoring me after the fourth or fifth item.  It continued about its business, but it would not give me any more items.  I still don't know exactly why, since this was such an edge case scenario.  I have a large toolchest of utilities and commands for manipulating player inventories and map contents.  But it's rare that you need to command a monster to give you stuff.  Normally you get a monster's inventory the old-fashioned way. You pay the iron price. I was irked by the monkey's emergent nonchalance, so I pulled out the hammer: > eval monkey.kill(me()) > Ok > You killed monkey. Where me() in this case is the attacker. As I feared, the corpse's inventory was completely empty, because I clear out the inventory for pet monsters, to prevent abuses where you just create them in builder mode, take their stuff, and make infinite cash. So I busted out the clone() command and manually recreated the rest of the missing items as best I could, and gave them all back to Wifey.  I'm pleased to report that this story had a happy ending. How to Make a Game You look at a game like Wyvern, which is at its heart just a tiles game like the old roguelikes, and maybe a bit of a MUD, and you think, gosh, I could do that.  And you can! Off the top of my head, you will need:   * A cloud computing platform such as AWS, Azure or GCP.   * Xcode and a Mac, or else Android Studio and a whatever-you-want.   * A programming language and a compiler. These days, I would go with Kotlin.   * A service for browsing and licensing music and sound effects. They have those now.   * A service for hiring contractors for artwork and maybe level design. They have those too!   * A hosted datastore, because seriously it's 2016, don't administer your own.   * A source hosting and bug tracking service, such as Bitbucket.   * A good lawyer and a good accountant.   * About twenty years. Ha!  I kid.  I've only put about ten years into it, spread over the past twenty years.  I started in 1996; my character Rhialto will turn 20 on March 1st.  But in terms of total person-years, it's in the hundreds, largely due to area design contributed by dozens of passionate volunteers. It's amazing how much stuff we have access to since I started this project back in 1996.  Back then, I had Java, and we're not talking about Java 8 with fancy lambdas and streams.  We're talking Java 1.0.2, with that O'Reilly book with the referees on the the front.  You had to roll everything yourself back then.  Uphill both ways, in the snow.  (Actually the game started in C++ in 1995, but I migrated to Java and never looked back.) I went through something of a life crisis in 2004, after 8 years of working on the game, because my productivity had tanked as the code base grew, and I wanted it back.  So I stopped working on the game, for the most part, and went on a Grail-like quest to find a good language -- one that was ultimately unsuccessful, although I learned a lot and got some good rants out of it all. Nowadays, though, sheesh.  Between GitHub and its infinite supply of high-quality libraries, cloud providers and their hosted services, Stack Overflow and its infinite supply of answers to just about every question you'll ever encounter, and all the services available for payments and contractors and everything else you could want -- I mean, it's a startup's dream come true.  I am way more productive than I was in 2003.  All I needed was a time machine. Even so, a game like this -- which, despite its simple appearance, is a true MMORPG with surprising depth -- is basically an infinite amount of work.  Lifetimes of work.  So you have to practice triage, time management, and stress management. But really, anyone can do it.  You just gotta _want_ it bad enough. Apple vs. Android I have enough material for lots of blog posts now, and I'd love to spend some time exploring Google's Cloud Platform (GCP) in future articles.  I've learned a thing or two about Android as well.  And Kotlin is absolutely entrancing.  I haven't used it yet for anything serious, but it's one of the best new languages to emerge in a long, long time.  Would love to talk more about Kotlin at some point. For today, though, I thought I'd offer a few musings on Apple, iOS, and their store ecosystem.  I'm still no expert, and I don't do anything iOS-related at work.  This is just some very personal impressions I've collected while making the game. A lot of people have asked me why I did my first mobile client in iOS rather than Android.  The answer is monetization.  iOS is straight-up easier to monetize.  Android has cultivated a frugal audience, through both marketing and hardware choices, and that cultivation has been a success.  Android users tend to be frugal.  That doesn't mean they don't spend money, but it does mean they are more cautious about it.  I have friends who've done simultaneous iOS/Android releases for their apps, and invariably the iOS users outspend the Android users by anywhere from 4:1 to 10:1 -- anecdotally, to be sure, but a little Googling is enough to support just about any confirmation bias you like.  So I picked iOS. When I started, I didn't know Objective-C, and I started just before Swift came out, just a couple of months.  But by then I was far enough into development, and wary enough from prior experiences with new languages, that I opted to continue in Obj-C.  Obviously today I'd do it in Swift, and if I weren't always so time-constrained, I could even start introducing Swift class-by-class.  Swift is cool.  It actually reminds me a lot of Kotlin.  I think language designers must have some sort of clique these days, whether they know it or not. What about iOS?  Well, there's not much to it.  And that's a good thing.  It feels familiar, at least if you've done any sort of UI programming at all in your career.  I've done some Java AWT and Swing, some Microsoft MFC and whatnot, some X-windows work, some web programming, whatever -- rarely anything major, but I've tinkered with UI throughout my career.  Frontend UI is a skill every engineer should have, even if it's just one framework that you know well. Coming from all those frameworks, I had certain expectations, and they were 100% met by iOS.  It has an MVC framework, and you add views and subviews, and you have all the hooks and lifecycle events you'd expect -- after learning Objective-C, I'd say it was only about four days (thanks to the excellent Big Nerd Ranch book) before I was able to start cranking out reams of code by copying it all directly from Stack Overflow, as is tradition. Why am I making such a big deal about iOS's almost boring familiarity?  Because Android is the exact opposite of intuitive and familiar.  I've gotta be a little careful here, since I recently joined the Android tools team at Google, and I don't want to throw anyone under the bus.  They did the best they could with the environment and situation they had when they started back in the early 2000s, which featured phones that didn't even have memory -- they just had "address/contact slots".  It was awful.  They did fine. But now, thanks to Moore's Law, even your wearable Android or iOS watch has gigs of storage and a phat CPU, so all the decisions they made turned out in retrospect to be overly conservative.  And as a result, the Android APIs and frameworks are far, far, FAR from what you would expect if you've come from literally any other UI framework on the planet.  They feel alien.  This reddit thread pretty well sums up my early experiences with Android development. So as much as I'd love to make an Android client for my game, it's not going to happen for a while.  Plus I'm still iterating heavily on the iOS UI, so I might as well wait until it stabilizes a bit. That's enough about Android for today.  I always gauge how edgy my blog posts are by how likely I am to get fired over them, and my little indicator is redlining, so let's move back to Apple and iOS. Apple:  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Objective C isn't so bad.  They have continued iterating on it, so even though its string handling is comically verbose, and it has no namespacing, and there are tons of other modern features missing, the language is pretty capable overall.  It has generics, literal syntax for sets/dictionaries/arrays, try/catch/finally macros, extremely well-implemented lambdas with proper closure capturing (unlike nearly every other non-functional language out there), properties, and many other modern conveniences.  The syntax is awful, and it can get pretty weird when you're bridging to the C APIs, but on the whole you wind up writing less code than you'd think. In fact, various bloggers have measured it, and if I recall correctly, the consensus is that Android Java is about 30% more verbose than Objective-C.  Which is pretty counterintuitive, because the Java language itself, verbose as it may be, is clearly less verbose than Objective-C.  What's happening here is that iOS has such good APIs, you wind up needing to write a lot less code to get your job done. So Obj-C isn't bad, and Swift looks really good.  The APIs are good, the documentation is solid, and Apple is aggressively deprecating crummy old APIs (like UIAlertView) in favor of better-designed ones.  Everything is still there in the system, and you can see generations of whole layers of API access dating all the way back to the old NeXT computers from the late '80s (heck, everything in iOS starts with NS, for NeXTStep) But you don't have to use most of that stuff, because Apple has been constantly layering on new APIs that modernize it all.  Unlike, you know... some other, uh, people. >.> Xcode is pretty good. It used to be bad, but now it's not bad at all.  Yes, it crashes more than I'd like, and yes, its refactoring support is abysmal.  It's no Visual Studio.  But "pretty good" is good enough.  Because all I'm doing is copying code from Stack Overflow, really I have no shame whatsoever, and Xcode works great for that.  It even formats it for me.  Who am I to complain?  Besides, I use Emacs for any serious editing. So for the Good, we have the languages, the APIs, and the tools.  What about the Bad? Well, Apple's review process is really, really, really long and convoluted.  Sure, I can totally understand why.  They have millions of developers trying to shoehorn crap into their store, and they are trying to make a strong quality stand.  But it means you're in for a wild ride if you're making anything more complicated than a flashlight app. First you have to go through their checklist of roughly seventeen thousand rules, and make sure you have addressed each of them, since all of them can result a veto.  And wouldn't you know it, I checked exactly sixteen thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine of those rules very carefully, so my app was rejected.  Because they don't mess about.  You have to follow all of them. The story of my app's rejection is epic enough for an opera, but in a nutshell, Apple requires that all apps support ipv6-only networks.  But none of the major Cloud providers supported ipv6 at the time of my submission, in late September.  You're pretty well covered if you're just doing HTTP(S), but if you use sockets you're hosed.  My game uses direct TCP/TLS connections to my cloud instances, so it didn't work on an ipv6-only network, and my app was kicked to the curb like so much garbage.  At least they did it quickly. After some technical consideration, I did the only logical thing, and got on my knees and begged them for an exception, because what am I gonna do?  Some cheesy hack with an ipv6 tunnel provider to a fixed IP address on a single instance?  Well, yeah, that's exactly what I was going to do, if push came to shove, just to get through the review. Even though it's completely non-scalable.  Desperate times. Fortunately, after a mere six weeks, and me finally sending them an angry-ish (but still cravenly and begging) note asking WTH, they granted me the exception for 1 year, backdated so it was really only 11 months, but whatevs.  I was approved! The Ugly Just kidding, haha joke's on me, I was NOT approved.  Because when they gave me the exception, they also threw in a major feature request.  Lordy.  It's almost like they're a monopoly or something.  They didn't like that my game required you to sign in via a social network -- Facebook, Google, or Twitter for now, since those are the sign-in SDKs that I've managed to wire up so far.  So they asked me to implement Wyvern Accounts. Sigh.  I was so relieved that I got the exception, I didn't fight it.  I called back to ask if it was OK to require an email address, for account/password recovery functionality (but also because I use the email address to tie your characters together), and they said that was fine. So I went to work, even though my game had already been in Alpha for six weeks too long, and I implemented Wyvern accounts.  New database table, new web service, new API service, new UI screens for registration and account creation and password resetting, new plumbing for passing credentials to the server, blah blah blah.  God dammit, the nerve of them to ask for such a big feature. A week later when it was all finished, I realized FB/Google/Twitter all have minimum age requirements (all 13 years minimum because of COPPA), so I had been protected until Apple threw their curveball at me.  Now I need underage reporting and god knows what else.  Still working through it with the lawyers. I'd go back to Plan B (in iOS-land, B is for Begging), except that I actually sort of agree with Apple that I need this feature.  Not everyone is on a social network.  For example, there is an uncontacted tribe deep in the South American rainforest who are not on Facebook yet, although I believe they are still eligible for Amazon Prime.  And also some of my alpha testers were struggling with it.  I guess there are a lot of people who not only don't have GMail, but they prefer not to sign up for a free account.  I can only assume the NSA is responsible for this phenomenon.  But it means I most likely need Wyvern accounts. Another reason I sort of need Wyvern accounts is that Facebook, Google and Twitter all have very different philosophies about email-verification APIs. Facebook's philosophy is, roughly: "What's a few API calls between friends?"  They have quotas, but they're so high that I won't have to worry about them for years. Google's philosophy is, roughly: "Our APIs should scale with your business."  They have quotas, but they're so high that I won't have to worry about them for years. Twitter's philosophy is, roughly: "Go fuck yourself."  I exhaust their tiny quotas every day, even after adding credential caching so that players only re-validate once every 8 hours or so.  Even though I only have a few dozen, maybe fifty regular players right now, only a handful of which use Twitter.  Their quotas are comically, absurdly low. So I'm probably going to have to yank Twitter out before launch, which would limit people to FB and Google sign-in.  And that seems like... not enough options.  I don't like having to maintain my own accounts, but I think I'm pretty well stuck with it. The takeaway (well, other than "don't use Twitter APIs"), is that Apple can jerk you around pretty much all they want, and you'd better like it.  You should basically prepare for a long review. Back to The Good Despite the bumps in the (long) road so far, some stuff has been great.  TestFlight, which is Apple's beta testing system, is working nicely for me.  It provides me with crash reports which have identified half a dozen real issues so far.  The sign-up is a snap, and they'll let me have up to 2000 testers, which will help me make sure my stuff scales, if I can get that many. And their review turnaround time has been pretty good.  It generally takes about a day, in my experience.  I'm not sure why they require a manual review for my Beta builds, after they've already approved me for the actual store launch.  And every build requires another 1-3 day review.  But I've got a pipeline going, and I'm pleased overall with how straightforward it has been. I'm really worried about In-App Purchases.  I offer them in my game (though it's definitely not pay-to-play), but Apple's testing for IAP leaves a lot to be desired.  You have to sandbox it, and this requires setting up separate accounts.  It's not possible to enable production IAP (with real money) before the actual launch.  But their sandbox environment makes it really easy to screw up a transaction, after which your device will prompt you for a store login every 5 minutes for the rest of your miserable life, and likely into the hereafter.  It's a mess. You can sort of enable IAP in Beta/TestFlight, but it's *free*, which means players would be able to acquire millions of coins for free, and it would require me to perform a full reset of everyone back to level 1 before launch.  I'm trying to avoid that. So I have no idea if my IAP really works.  I got it working in the sandbox at one point, and I'm hoping it works in prod, but until I'm confident that it's working, I'm going to have to charge for my app, to forestall the possibility of a massive meltdown from casual players (tourists, basically) eating up my server resources.  I don't want to get a gigantic bill from Google.  So I need to limit the growth as best I can for a while. Going Forward Building this game has been a lot of fun.  I've learned more from doing this project than from anything I've ever done that was work-related, at any job I've had.  Something about having to do a big project yourself forces you to pay attention to everything in a way that you rarely have to do at a corporation. I don't know if it's going to be a hit.  Statistically, probably not.  But I have some pretty darn loyal players.  The game was down for five years (2011-2016), and when I brought it back up, a hundred or so old timers appeared out of nowhere.  Many of them had to purchase iOS devices just to play, but they splurged.  And they started playing insane hours.  The ratio of 7-day-active to concurrent players has been crazy.  In the old days it was about 100:1, so on a server that could comfortably support 100 concurrent players, I'd typically have about 10k 7-day actives.  It was self-limiting because I only had one server back then. With these alpha testers, the ratio has been about 4:1.  They're playing upwards of 8 hours a day, around the clock.  And they're all over the world -- I have testers in Japan, England, New Zealand, Spain, Nigeria, Toronto, east coast, west coast, I forget where they're all from.  But we're talking about a group of only about 60-70 regulars, so the diversity is quite remarkable. This letter they wrote me back in 2012, when the game went down so I could port it to Cloud, gives a pretty good sense of how much people like it. I'll report back in a few months and let you know how the launch went.  Meantime, if you want to play, visit http://ghosttrack.com.  Hope to see you online!

Delhi Park moves from Foley Road? Only on Google Jennie Key, jkey@communitypress.com 8:47 a.m. EST November 17, 2016 Buy Photo Delhi Park has a new sign and a new address to go with it. (Photo: Jennie Key/The Community Press)Buy Photo Where is Delhi Park? Google it, and you find it at 5125 Foley Road, but Delhi Township officials want visitors to find the park at 421 Delhi Park Drive. How do you move a park? It’s simple. Change the address. Delhi Park’s official address has been on Foley Road for years. If you used Google or use Mapquest to get directions, your route would be direct to the Foley Road entrance to the park and its ballfields, skate park and other amenities, avoiding the township’s business district altogether. Delhi officials say that’s not ideal and Plan the Pike consultant Stantec’s Urban Places Group suggested that changing the park’s official address from Foley Road to Delhi Park Road off Delhi Pike would drive traffic to the community’s business corridor. Administrator Pete Landrum says this is an easy fix that should pay off quickly for Delhi businesses on the Pike. “We are just changing the official address of the park,” he said. “We would have events like tournaments on the ballfields and people would ask if there was anywhere close by to get something to eat. Visitors had no idea our business district was so close.” He says the address change coupled with notifications to Google and other internet routers will direct park visitors to the park via Delhi Pike, and a new park entrance sign installed at Delhi Park Road will help them find the recreation facilities there. The parcel assignment will also reflect the new address Trustees approved the address change at a meeting last month, and parks director Joshua Torbeck says he’s working to get all the pieces in place to make the change. Torbeck says Glen Carder Lodge is keeping the Foley Road address, but he’s working with the U.S. Postal Service on the address change for the park. And it will take a while for the change to migrate out to internet sites such as Google. “It’s definitely a work in progress,” Torbeck said. 40 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2g1DSDk TOP VIDEOS La Salle wins regional championship 0:55 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01

The Warwick Rowers strip off every year for the calendar, which aims to raise awareness and promote greater tolerance among young people. The calendar is hugely successful, donating all of its profits to charities including pro-gay organisation Sport Allies and The University of Warwick. However, this is not the first time something like this has happened. Several years ago, the Warwick Rowers were removed from Google Checkout’s payment processing service without notice. This decision was later upheld at appeal, on the grounds that the Warwick Rowers were pornographers. In a statement The Warwick Rowers and their photographer, Angus Malcolm, said: “Several years ago, the plucky Warwick Rowers were thrown off Google Checkout’s payment processing service without notice – a decision that was upheld on appeal, on the grounds that the Warwick Rowers are pornographers. “Today, in a similar vein, YouTube has decided that the rowers’ public awareness campaign aimed at promoting greater tolerance among young people is unsuitable for, uh, young people. Way to go, Google!” They continued: “Bizarrely, Google were a lot more relaxed only a few days ago when the Warwick Rowers reported that a Google user was illegally sharing their charity fundraising content. “Google twice rejected the Warwick Rowers appeal for help, before shutting up shop for the weekend with the content still available, and did not manage to respond effectively until after the rowers threatened legal action against the corporation. “”And these are the guys who promise to do no evil,” commented one rower, saddened at seeing their hard work for charity being undermined by the massive corporation. “That’s not been our experience at all.” Today’s verdict has resulted in the Warwick Rowers having to resort to other channels to publicise their calendar. The Rowers are now urging those who have embedded the YouTube to replace it with the Vimeo version. @emsferg Share on Facebook More The Tab Warwick The Tab Warwick News Pingback: Charity Warwick Rowers banned from YouTube for being ‘pornographers’ – MaleSpace.com() The eight types of girl you’ll live with at some point in your life Warwick’s most eligible bachelor 2016 nomination: Tom Martin Sorry, but I’m not buying Emma Watson’s brand of twee, faux-feminism Literally just an appreciation post full of pictures of young Joe Biden Warwick’s most eligible bachelor 2016: Nominations are now open Warwick student starts petition to lower heating on campus We should have listened to Kylie Jenner about 2016 Campus style: Sweater Weather Why the Dirty Duck is the best thing about Warwick University Which Peep Show character is your uni?

The money was distributed to 124 projects in 25 European countries, with the lion’s share in terms of value going to Germany, Spain and France. All participants received at least 300 000 euros. The funding is part of Google’s Digital News Initiative, a project launched last year to “advance innovation in the news industry.” A first round of funding in March disbursed 27 million euros for 128 projects. The money is intended to help fund start-up media projects or to help established media organisations attempt to set up new programmes. Separately, Google announced that the German version of its Google News page will start carrying a “fact check” tab this week, which allows readers to access further information about reports. It said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper and Corrective website would soon start making use of the service. Google noted it does not fact check the items itself.

Charity calendar stars the Warwick Rowers banned from YouTube for being ‘pornographers’ · PinkNews Enter your email address to receive our daily LGBT news roundup Sign up No thanks You're free to unsubscribe at any time. Follow @pinknews News News Home UK US World Trans Politics Education Law Religion Business Entertainment Trans Opinion Travel Life Life Home Health Sport About Advertise Contact Privacy RSS Search Home UK US World Current Affairs Entertainment Opinion Travel Features Trans Community Charity calendar stars the Warwick Rowers banned from YouTube for being ‘pornographers’ Joseph Patrick McCormick, PinkNews 17th November 2016, 12:46 PM The Warwick Rowers were banned from YouTube The Warwick Rowers have been banned for YouTube despite achieving worldwide recognition after fundraising for equality. The naked athletes have been long standing supportive figures for the LGBT community, and in 2014 they were awarded the PinkNews Community Group of the Year award. At the time Mrs Morgan joked that she attempted to access the Rowers’ website but that it was blocked from Department for Education computers. She said: “My office tried to show me their website on the Department for Education computers, but then we found that their website was blocked. When they subsequently showed me on their iPhones, I quickly saw why. They have won a PinkNews Award for their full monty fundraising efforts, but I have to report that they are wearing their clothes tonight here in Speaker’s House.” But according to a statement from the University of Warwick’s rowing team, they were banned from YouTube for being “pornographers”. It now appears their account has been unblocked, but it is unclear how long they were blocked for and if they will be barred from posting again. A statement from photographer Angus Malcolm and the Rowers, reads: “Several years ago, the plucky Warwick Rowers were thrown off Google Checkout’s payment processing service without notice – a decision that was upheld on appeal, on the grounds that the Warwick Rowers are pornographers. “Today, in a similar vein, YouTube has decided that the rowers’ public awareness campaign aimed at promoting greater tolerance among young people is unsuitable for, uh, young people. Way to go, Google! “Bizarrely, Google were a lot more relaxed only a few days ago when the Warwick Rowers reported that a Google user was illegally sharing their charity fundraising content. Google twice rejected the Warwick Rowers appeal for help, before shutting up shop for the weekend with the content still available, and did not manage to respond effectively until after the rowers threatened legal action against the corporation. ‘And these are the guys who promise to do no evil,’ commented one rower, saddened at seeing their hard work for charity being undermined by the massive corporation. ‘That’s not been our experience at all.'” “And these are the guys who promise to do no evil… That’s not been our experience at all,” said one rower. Year on year the group produce a calendar and proceeds from sales are donated to charities, including the Sport Allies charity the team set up, that work towards equality. Sport Allies is about to launch an academic report on homophobia and gender inequality. A spokesperson for the Warwick Rowers said on announcing their 2017 calendar last week: “There has been a 147% increase in homophobic attacks post Brexit, and it seems likely the Trump vote will amplify this globally. “Never before has the LGBT community had greater need of its straight allies to assert that the battle for LGBT rights comes not from self-interest but from a belief in justice.” The Warwick Rowers project is one of the world’s most eye-catching straight ally projects, and its influence continues to grow. The team began their calendar journey in 2009, and have delivered their product globally. They aim to promote positive, inclusive and respectful attitudes towards people of all genders and sexualities through the content. The team went to London Pride for the first time this year to challenge homophobia and break down perceptions.

Google's latest handset launched last month, and several customers bought the phone through the company's Project Fi carrier – ordering the handsets to be delivered to a reseller in New Hampshire, where there is no sales tax. As money-saving site Dan's Deals explains (via The Guardian), the reseller was therefore able to make a small profit on the phones, which it split with the customers who had ordered the devices. Related: Pixel phone review Google users who participated in the practice have had their entire Google accounts suspended, leaving them unable to use Mail, Photos, Documents, or any other Google apps linked to their account. It looks like Google is taking a hard line on this one, with one user reporting an account that was listed as a back-up address for the main account used to buy the Pixel had also been suspended. The Pixel XL Google's terms of service prohibit reselling of Google products, stating that customers “may only purchase Devices for your personal use [and] may not commercially resell any Device”. But it seems, according to Dan's Deals, that the New Hampshire reseller has been taking advantage of the tax loophole for some years without Google taking action. Related: Pixel XL review Dan's Deals says: "There are over 200 people who are locked out of their Google accounts currently. Some of those people used multiple Google accounts in order to place orders for more than 5 phones and they are locked out of all of the accounts." "...In total a few thousand phones were ordered this time, which is fewer phones than were ordered in the past. However this time was the first time that they were ordered through Project Fi, as they were shipping out faster that way." Those who've had their accounts suspended will be unable to access stored photos or authenticate password changes that require email verification – making the ban potentially very disruptive. It's unclear whether the account suspensions are temporary at this time, or whether the affected users will be permanently banned for their actions. WATCH: Google Pixel Phone Overpriced?

Caption: Caption: GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt exits the stage after being interviewed at the Washington Ideas Forum in Washington, DC, on September 28, 2016. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Cade Metz. Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 11.17.16. 11.17.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Giant Corporations Are Hoarding the World’s AI Talent GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images General Electric builds jet engines and wind turbines and medical gear. But the 124-year-old industrial giant is also transforming itself for the digital age. It’s fashioning software that pulls data from all this hardware, hoping to gain an insight into industrial operations that was never possible in the past. The problem is that analyzing all this data is difficult, and the talent needed to make it happen is scarce. So GE is going shopping. The company just paid an undisclosed amount to acquire a Berkeley-based machine learning startup called Wise.io. “There’s thirty of them,” GE CEO Jeff Immelt says gleefully of the Wise.io team, which is heavy with astrophysicists. “You match them with aviation data, and they’re killer.” That’s great for GE and Immelt—and for their customers. But what if you’re a small software company trying to inject some AI into your operation? Wise.io was on a mission to “democratize AI”—to creating tools anyone could use to build machine learning services—but it’s now disappearing into GE. And at a time when machine learning is the prime way of staying competitive in the software world, that’s a notable thing. In the battle for scarce AI talent, companies like GE have an overwhelming advantage. The cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback. Not everyone can go out and grab thirty AI-happy astrophysicists. And if you can’t do that, the talent pool becomes very small very quickly, since these machine learning techniques are so new and so different from standard software development. Even the big players talk about the tiny talent pool: Microsoft research chief Peter Lee says the cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback. Over the past few years, other heavyweights have snapped up so many other AI startups you’ve never heard of. Twitter bought Mad Bits, Whetlab, and Magic Pony. Apple bagged Turi and Tuplejump. Salesforce acquired MetaMind and Prediction I/O. Intel acquired Nervana. And that’s just a partial list. And it’s not just software and Internet companies doing the buying. It’s also giants like Samsung and GE that are incorporating AI into physical things. As soon as startups spring up to meet the AI need, they get sucked up into the maws of the hungriest, richest corporations. “These big companies are establishing their advantage,” says Chris Nicholson, the founder of Skymind, a still-independent deep learning startup. “Technology is always a battlefield, and they’re tilting it with these acquisitions.” A Shrinking Pool Nicole Shanahan is seeing this firsthand. Her startup, ClearAccessIP, is building software that seeks to automatically analyze patent portfolios. The company uses the latest in machine learning techniques to mine relevant information for patent transactions. That means Shanahan needs data scientists, people with experience in deep neural networks and software like Google’s open source TensorFlow engine that drives this increasingly important form of AI. She’s trying to hire four data scientists who specialize in machine learning, and she can’t land even one. Last week, she put an offer out to a candidate in Canada, but he declined, saying he couldn’t make the move to the States. “It really slows us down,” Shanahan says. “We may end up hiring him as a contractor and letting him work from there.” Can’t she just hire ordinary coders? Not really. Building this machine learning technology is quite different from standard software engineering. It’s less about coding and more about coaxing results from vast pools of data. The irony is that Shanahan’s domestic partner happens to be Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, one of the main companies soaking up so much of the available deep learning talent. In 2013, Google acquired DNNresearch, nabbing one of the primary forces behind this technology’s recent rise: University of Toronto professor Geoff Hinton. Then it snapped up DeepMind, the company that recently shocked the AI world by building system that could crack the ancient game of Go. These acquisitions were the start of the industry’s buying spree.

We’ll Train Them Like Dogs But it’s not just that big players like Google are buying up so much of the talent. It’s that these big players are nabbing so many startups that were trying to make AI development tools accessible to all kinds of businesses—tools that would let businesses take advantage of AI without needing as much in-house talent. Like Wise.io, Metamind aimed to provide tools that anyone could use to build machine learning services, but it has now disappeared into Salesforce. Nervana, another option, is now part of Intel. So, in a way, the world needs even more AI talent than it otherwise would—though there are signs that some of the big players will pick up the mantle of democratized AI. In the wake of the US presidential election, it may be even harder for small players to find talent. Last week, University of Montreal professor Yoshua Bengio, another key player in the deep learning movement invited AI researchers and data scientists to Quebec, where he is trying to bootstrap an entire community of companies around deep learning research. “In the depressing aftermath of the US elections, I would like to point out that interesting things are happening in the great Canadian North, with a very different kind of government,” he wrote on Facebook. Yann LeCun, the French born head of AI at Facebook, reposted the invitation, no small thing in the tiny, close-knit global community of AI researchers. “Montréal looks like a good landing site if you are an AI researcher looking for a job in North America and you belong to one (or several) categories of now-undesirable people for the newly-elected US government,” LeCun said. That potential brain drain is not a big problem for big companies like Facebook and Google and Microsoft and, yes, GE. As Immelt points out, they’re international companies that can employ researchers practically anywhere. In his post, LeCun points out that Facebook now operates an AI lab in Paris. But that dispersal of talent could add one more layer of difficulty for smaller players here in the States. If researchers flee the country and others decline to come, the pool of available talent shrinks even further, receding beyond US borders and even further into the biggest companies. For smaller companies, the hope is that some of that expertise will trickle down in the years to come. Correction: This story has been updated to clarify the mission of ClearAccessIP. Go Back to Top.

The search giant has partnered with the Ministry of Urban Development in India to launch 'Toilet Locator', a new feature that will reportedly let you find the cleanest toilet nearby, for you know, those times when nature doesn't even call, just simply decides to barge in. Google will do a pilot run of the feature first in Delhi NCR starting sometime between November 16 to November 30. You will be able to locate clean toilets using Google Maps either around you or in any location. The feature is being introduced in collaboration with MoUD under the Government of India's "Swachhata Pakhwada" or Cleanliness Fortnight campaign. The Toilet Locator will pick up public restrooms in malls, petrol pumps, metro stations, hospitals and the likes and show them on Google Maps. An official told IBTimes mapping the toilets in the NCR region was almost over. All users need to do now is fire up Google Maps and search for toilets near them using keywords ranging from 'toilets' to lavatory, swach, swacchata, shulabh or shauchalay and Google will display the nearby restrooms on the map. Mapping the toilets is a crowdsourced effort and anyone can update the database. People can also rate the cleanliness of the toilets they last searched for, or even leave a review if you are feeling particularly poetic about the dump you just took. It's still not clear yet when the feature will be available to the rest of the country. "Mechanisms are in place for the facility to be scaled up, and for it to reach all the 2,041 urban local bodies of the country," IBTimes reported.

Credit: CUMP Ad Age's second annual Women to Watch Mexico event honored 15 outstanding women in marketing, advertising and media at a luncheon Nov. 14 at Club 51, on the 51st floor of the Torre Mayor, the third-tallest building in Mexico City. The event was organized by Adlatina, Ad Age's partner in Spanish-speaking Latin America. This year's honorees, who spoke at the luncheon attended by almost 200 people, are leading change in a fast-moving world. Liliana Inigo Elias brought a wealth of experience to Citibanamex when she joined as chief marketing officer four months ago. She started in packaged goods at Procter & Gamble and then Nestle, became the marketing head for a number of Walmart businesses in Mexico, then entered financial services at MasterCard. "The speed of retail is one of the most important things I learned," she told Ad Age. She oversaw the rebranding of Mexican bank Banamex as Citibanamex in October, and is involved in Citi's transformation to digital banking, opening three digital branches in October, with more to come. Paula Figueroa, Flock - Linked by Isobar.

She became a digital specialist just two years ago, after developing a longtime interest in social media and joining Flock last year, shortly before the independent digital shop was acquired by Dentsu Aegis Network. "I arrived with humility to say I don't know everything, but understand the integration of ideas," Ms. Figueroa told Ad Age. "Clients started to see us as not just a digital agency but as an integrated one." Other agency honorees include Rocio Elizondo, an entrepreneur who brought Havas Health to Mexico, and Marta Ruiz-Cuevas, chosen to bring together all Publicis Groupe's media brands in Mexico under the new Publicis Media. "We moved 500 people in a month," Ms. Ruiz-Cuevas told Ad Age. Honorees Liliana Inigo Elias, Rocio Elizondo, Paola Figueroa and Marta Ruiz-Cuevas. Credit: CUMP Publicis Media team.

Lourdes Berho, who became CEO of the Mexico Tourism board this year at the invitation of Mexico's tourism minister, said she is restructuring the country's international campaigns, based on a recent segmentation study in North America that found that 18 million people were interested in traveling to places like Mexico. "We'll identify what drives them to travel and what distribution channels we need to use," she said. A similar segmentation model is coming up for Europe. Honoree Xiomara Martin Matos, from Unilever, with her family. Credit: CUMP Known for mining strategies for both brands and buyers of Unilever's products as consumer marketing insights director, Xiomara Martin Matos is responsible for 15 categories in 15 countries in Latin America. She was one of several honorees to allude to the recent U.S. elections, saying that "a door has opened to hatred and validating sexism." She said three things are clear: "Believe in ourselves; have clear objectives; and unite, not just as women, but as Mexico." Alejandra Villarreal, a Unilever and Danone veteran, joined Henkel a year ago as director of marketing, for laundry products such as detergent brand Persil and homecare in Latin America, which includes markets like Guatemala, where she says many women still wash clothes by hand. She works with Greenpeace and children's groups such as UNICEF and her job at Henkel, which she says takes corporate responsibility seriously, aligns with her core values. "In Latin America, it doesn't matter if you have the resources, you are resourceful," she said. Google's Olga San Jacinto (center) with daughter Sofia (left), and Alejandra Villarreal, of Henkel.

Olga San Jacinto brought her 13-year-old daughter Sofia, with whom she made a joint decision to move to Mexico two years ago for Google, after working with Google Maps in New York and earlier being part of Google's initial launch team in Europe. In Mexico, her role is to accelerate revenue growth, including mobile. "That includes helping Mexican companies to sell in other countries digitally without opening physical stores," she told Ad Age. Esperansita Bejnarowicz's mother and sister flew to Mexico City from Toronto for the event. Ms. Bejnarowicz, a Canadian, moved to Mexico from Detroit six years ago to introduce digital initiatives for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Mexico and now oversees all advertising for the company's seven brands.

If you're ready, you use the energy to hit back harder." Another honoree from the auto industry, Ana Paulina Velazquez, was hired away from Renault last year to help launch the Kia brand, a latecomer to Mexico, and has already been promoted. Honoree Sharon Zyman, Turner. Credit: CUMP As proof that Mexico's honorees are truly women to watch, half of the 14-person inaugural Women to Watch Mexico class from 2015 has already been promoted or changed companies since last year's event in Mexico City. Maria Teresa "Mariate" Arnal, who was leading digital transformation as CEO of JWT Mexico, joined Twitter in September as director general for Spanish-speaking Latin America. Former Saatchi & Saatchi CEO Analu Solano has been general manager of Cheil Mexico for the past three months. Regional Coca-Cola Co. creativity and content exec Marta Fontcuberta has been promoted to a global Coke role in Atlanta, and Magdalena Ferreira Lamas has gone from VP-marketing at Avon to general manager. Laura Tapia, director of marketing capabilities for Latin America, has left P&G to be a consultant. And Carolina Arana, a former swimmer, took very early retirement from Kellogg to run and grow three swimming schools she started with her husband.

Home India news Government joins hands with Google to help you locate nearest clean public toilet Government joins hands with Google to help you locate nearest clean public toilet Sanitation has always been one of the bigger problems in a densely populated country like India. Tech giant Google has decided to do its bit in helping people in a way, to find hygienic sanitary utilities. By: FE Online | Published: November 17, 2016 5:21 PM Google is working with Indian Ministry of Urban Development to bring out a Toilet Locator, which will offer an easier way to find the fastest way to a clean toilet facility. (PTI) Sanitation has always been one of the bigger problems in a densely populated country like India. Tech giant Google has decided to do its bit in helping people in a way, to find hygienic sanitary utilities. Google is working with Indian Ministry of Urban Development to bring out a Toilet Locator, which will offer an easier way to find the fastest way to a clean toilet facility, according to an IBT report. Google Maps is the service which will be providing suggestions and recommendations for public restrooms which are located on the outside and also in public areas like stations, hospitals and malls. The Urban development ministry and Google together will fight will the problem by providing people with the ability to search toilets in Maps by typing in related words, either in English or native languages. Words such as lavatory, toilets, sulabh and Swachhata can be used to find the same. An official from MoUD informed IBT that they want people to let other users inform about a particular locations condition. The official was quoted as saying, “The system being put in place relies heavily on crowdsourcing, with people’s feedback helping fuel it.” People will be able to give reviews and rating based on their experience. The pilot plan of Google tool is now available in Delhi. It will not only show public restrooms but also, petrol pumps, hospitals and many other public places where people can go. According to the report, the ministry does not have a proper plan or timeline to execute in other cities and it will take some time to expand the program. As of now, 60 percent of the 1.2 billion people in India still defecate and urinate in the open, leading to serious sanitation issues, according to Public Radio International. Overall, 70 out of every 100 homes in the country still do not have proper clean toilet access. The MoUD official told IBTimes India, “Mechanisms are in place for the facility to be scaled up, and for it to reach all the 2,041 urban local bodies (ULBs) of the country.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Chrome Not Backing In-Built Ad-Blocking; Plans to Better Ads Instead November 17, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Google PhotoScan App to Digitize Your Old Photo Prints iPad Pro 2017; Apple Pushing for Bezel-Free Variant alongside Massive iPad Pro Ad-blocking services have garnered good demand among many net surfers in the recent years, that it has started arriving as in-built features in most of the browsers we have today. But that’s not the case with Google Chrome, as the world’s most preferred browser seems to be in no mood to shower lover over ad-blockers. Darin Fisher, Vice President of Chrome Engineering has clarified the views of the company with this regard while speaking to CNET, explaining that Chrome will not be roping in-built ad-blocking services like the rest. Instead, the company is eyeing to better ads, but for the better of the consumers. Google is backing a project with which they are trying to fix ads that causes sluggish load times instead of having them removed from the websites. Mr. Fisher has asserted that the ecosystem could be improved if publishers and advertisers incorporate ads the right way. Google remains one of the initiators of the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that intents to work upon the current ad algorithm in an effort to lift the curses showered by users over slow-loading ads. The move is currently backed by others like Facebook, The Washington Post etc. Despite having their views cleared, Chrome has still been working on curbing down the issues caused by ad with many services. Besides, the company also disables the running of document.write– a program that scrutinizes the ad performance in turn causing pages to load slower – by itself when detecting slow networks. Google’s incorporation of an in-built ad-blocker also never seemed like being longed by the users. But it was the recent trend that sparked the possibility of an ad-blocker inclusion. Opera was one major browser that adopted the move to include in-built ad-blocking services. There are also browsers that are rolling out today with ad-blocking services turned on by default.

Analysis Nine months after announcing its Telecom Infrastructure Project (TIP), Facebook has held its first summit and unveiled new partners and a first concrete project, a white box transponder/router for fibre backhaul, called Voyager. This is an indication, if any were needed, that the social media giant was not just tub-thumping when it pledged, at this year’s Mobile World Congress, to shake up the traditional network infrastructure supply chain. TIP membership expands, though no US giants The first TIP Summit was held earlier this month in Menlo Park, California. New operator members include Bell Canada, Middle Eastern carrier du, NBN and Telstra from Australia, Orange and the Nordics’ Telia. New vendor sign-ups came from Accenture, Amdocs, Canonical, HPE and Toyota InfoTechnology Center, among others. Founder members included Nokia, SK Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Intel and others, and in May they were joined by more major operators - Axiata Digital, Indosat, MTN, Telefonica and Vodafone – plus additional vendors. There are still significant gaps, notably the two US giants Verizon and AT&T (though they are part of Facebook’s similar, older initiative for data centre gear, Open Compute Project). TIP is a double-edged sword for those operators which have been accustomed to tight control of their circle of suppliers, since in return for the promise of lower costs, they hand the initiative in driving network infrastructure to Facebook – a company which, on the services side, is eating their lunch with over-the-top services such as Messenger and WhatsApp. But TIP now has about 300 members and has enough representation from major carriers to be capable of significant disruption to business as normal for the vendors, on a near-global basis. As with Google Android on the open software side, most of the technologies in TIP are, so far at least, coming from Facebook itself. That gives it a large level of control of how platforms evolve, but also leaves it with the bulk of the cost. Its latest contribution is Voyager, which it says is the first white box transponder/router, and which supports Open Packet DWDM (dense wave division multiplexing*). This design will be available to the TIP operators and vendors via one of its sub-projects, called Backhaul: Open Optical Packet Transport. Facebook debuts Open Packet Transport Facebook is already trialling its implementation of the Open DWDM platform, Voyager, which is designed to drive down costs in the same way as Facebook’s Wedge 100 white box switch did in the data center. Voyager uses the same Broadcom Tomahawk switch ASIC chip as Wedge 100. Facebook said that other partners in developing Voyager were Acacia Communications, Lumentum Holdings, Celestica and Snaproute. The first triallists are Equinix and MTN in South Africa. Equinix said preliminary trial results "showed zero packet loss and significant overall cost savings due to this disaggregated hardware and software networking model”. The first vendor to support the Open Packet Transport platform is ADVA Optical Networking, which plans to sell Voyager and pro-vide network management, operations support and maintenance. ADVA CTO and COO Christoph Glingener called Voyager: “A game changer that will open up networks to a whole new range of customers”. All this is not just about cost, but about keeping up the rate of evolution in important technologies such as DWDM*, which enabled a step increase in fiber network capacity when it was first commercialized. In a blog post, three Facebook engineers, Ilya Lyubomirsky, Brian Taylor and Hans-Juergen Schmidtke, wrote: “The pace of innovation has slowed over the past 10 years as we approach the limits of spectral efficiency”. They argue in the post that an open approach drives greater efficiencies into DWDM transport. "By unbundling the hardware and software in existing 'black box' systems, which include transponders, filters, line systems, and control and management software, we can advance each component independently and deliver even more bandwidth with greater cost efficiency," they wrote. Voyager is similar to many other small form-factor WDM units available in the competitive metro area fibre market, so will have to live up to its promises of low costs to make an impact, beyond Facebook’s own deployments, and to drive adoption of the open platform. It is an open one-rack unit DWDM device with eight 100Gbps quad small form-factor clients and four 200Gbps 16QAM on the line side. It can support long-haul transport and metro area data centre links. It may not be a revolutionary project per se, but the optical space is ripe for change in backhaul and data centres. The optical transport network is one of the areas where telcos are moving most rapidly towards software-defined networking (SDN), which is a major spur to migrate from proprietary equipment to off-the-shelf boxes. Google and Facebook blow apart network norms Along with Google, Amazon and Microsoft, Facebook has already started to transform the economics of webscale data centre infrastructure by commissioning in-house designs for servers and even processors, and then open sourcing some of that work to create a broad ecosystem around open, commodity hardware. That process is harder in networking, where there are far more different pieces of equipment to consider, and it is especially tough in the mobile network, with its exceptional performance patterns and its long history of proprietary, optimized designs from a small, closed and protective circle of vendors and chipmakers. But the financial pressures on operators, and the shift towards and virtualization, has made Facebook’s approach far more viable, at least in large portions of the network. More and more processes will run in software on off-the-shelf hardware, even though some of the more demanding mobile network functions will still need specialized coprocessors to hit optimal levels. Facebook’s contribution to blowing apart the traditional supply chain is coming from TIP, a telco version of its own Open Compute Project (OCP), and from a companion effort called OpenCellular, which is aiming to define an open platform for low cost base stations, with a particular emphasis on small cells to push coverage to remote areas. This, of course, is a key goal both for Facebook and Google, which are using a variety of methods to accelerate the pace of bringing high speed access to the unserved millions. They are building their own networks in areas where the established operators are slow to act, developing solutions based on drones, stratellites and new spectrum options such as TV white spaces. In Facebook’s case, it is also contributing some of its in-house developments to TIP and OpenCellular, to make them available to other vendors and hope to stimulate a wide, open ecosystem. This will make the networks more affordable and encourage other service providers to jump into the business of remote internet access – neither Facebook or even Google, surely, will want to be network operators if they can help it. Even in the case of Google Fiber, in the US, the primary motivation appears to be to kick the carriers into action. The end goal—controlling a billion more users In the end, the goal for these web giants is to bring more users online to consume their services and view their customers’ adverts. Google has not gone down the road of open source hardware yet, but does routinely open source key software developments, such as Android, to put itself at the heart of disruptive new mobile or telco platforms. In addition to its attempts to shake up the cost of infrastructure build-out, Facebook is also aiming to disrupt the cost of mobile service delivery with its internet.org initiative, which includes offerings like Facebook Basics – which provides some core apps, including Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, without counting towards the user’s data allowance. From internet-org and Facebook Basics to TIP and OpenCellular, operators are signing up with various degrees of enthusiasm or reluctance – but signing up they are, recognizing that, despite the compromises they are having to make to their own power, they cannot afford to have no voice at all in the new platforms, for fear the remnants of their influence are lost to new wireless service providers, from cablecos to OTT players. So Facebook is establishing itself all along the operator supply chain and service platform, but at the TIP Summit, of course, the focus was on hardware and the new cost base. “We have been working with partners to successfully test in the market and are excited about the ecosystem that has already come together around Voyager as part of TIP,” Jay Parikh, global head of engineering and infrastructure at Facebook, wrote in a company blog post. Other announcements at the TIP Summit included plans for the inaugural TIP Ecosystem Acceleration Center, which will be hosted by SK Telecom in South Korea, and is intended to be the first of a series round the world. TIP chairman Alex Jinsung Choi, who is also CTO of SK Telecom, said the centre will incubate local talent and accelerate innovation and product development. And a new project within TIP is the People and Process group, which aims to address the cultural and organisational changes which come with the shift to commodity hardware and software networking. The new group, co-chaired by Bell Canada and Facebook, will develop and share cultural and process transformation best practice to improve operators’ key performance indicators. Other members of the working group include Accenture, Agilitrix, Deloitte, HPE, NBN, SK Telecom, Tata, Telefonica and Telstra. NuRAN is first adopter for OpenCellular Of even more direct impact on mobile operators is OpenCellular, to which Facebook has already promised to contribute its core design for a rural small cell, for the Terragraph urban cell, and potentially for the Aries Massive MIMO system. Four months after it unveiled OpenCellular, Facebook announced at the TIP Summit that it had now open sourced all the project’s flies, including "schematic, lay-out, CAD files, specs and protocol as part of the TIP Access”. The speed of progress from Facebook itself has been impressive, but it needs to attract more third party support for commercial products based on its platforms. One small but highly relevant supporter, however, is NuRAN Wireless of Canada, whose LiteRAN 2G base station for remote areas is being validated under TIP, and which will distribute the OpenCellular products as they emerge. NuRAN provides outdoor GSM small cells with solar power for locations which have no access to traditional telecoms infrastructure. Now it will supply and support OpenCellular offerings as they go into trials. This will start early next year, and Facebook hopes to encourage broad familiarity with its platform to extend the ecosystem. The TIP and OpenCellular projects are in their very early days, and despite strong early headwinds, it is by no means certain they will achieve the transformations they are targeting in the telecoms industry, rather than becoming bogged down by processes and by the inherent conflicts of interest between many of the members. For MNOs, while they can clearly benefit from low cost, commoditized and open hardware platforms, these also lower the barriers to new entrants, especially as more unlicensed and shared spectrum comes into play, along with radical approaches to wholesale capacity such as bandwidth-on-demand and network slicing. How open can the mobile network become? As the network becomes an IT service platform, most of it should be indistinguishable from IT infrastructure, goes the thinking. Cloud computing, and to some extent Wi-Fi, have shown the way to this open infrastructure, not the mobile industry, and the new ecosystems often go hand-in-hand with open source software and, increasingly, hardware – a movement in which the mobile players have remarkably little influence. A research leader from no more subversive a company than Huawei, Peter Ashwood-Smith, posed the question last year: “Could 5G be more than 90 per cent code from open source origins?” Ashwood-Smith, head of IP research at Huawei Canada and chair of the ITU’s fixed line 5G focus group, described an entirely open source 4G network which could be deployed today, with Linux-based eNodeB and evolved packet core, Android devices, GNU radios and an open source HSS. In reality, this approach will take many years to become robust for commercial, large-scale networks. There are limits to the Facebook vision when it comes to cellular networks, especially when it comes to the radios and antennas themselves, which will have to become ever more sophisticated to deliver the promises of 5G, and will remain a source of cost and vendor differentiation for a long time to come. Aries is yet to be tested in anger, but there are sure to be many ways in which the established experts in antennas and MIMO will be able to differentiate themselves against it. The OpenCellular platform There is likely to be more impact in the near term from OpenCellular’s core platform, because it targets underserved areas where traditional vendors and operators continue to struggle with the economics of mobile broadband. Also, it provides a low cost, multi-operator small cell – a platform for which the industry is crying out. The initial OpenCellular design is a shoebox-sized unit which runs open source software and is designed to be mass produced by low cost vendors. It is a modular design which is software-defined and so can support a range of current and future protocols for licensed and unlicensed spectrum. It consists of a general baseband computer (GBC), equivalent to a baseband unit (BBU) in a mobile split architecture. This handles system functions as virtual network functions, and controls a separate subsystem with the software-defined radio, integrated analog front end, and system-on-chip functions where required, plus the antennas. The SDR and SoC versions support various open source and commercial cellular stacks. Facebook claims its system is very ruggedized and able to work in extremes of temperature and climate, but also self-installable to reduce cost and time to deployment, especially in remote communities. Its engineering team says it has “designed an innovative mounting solution that can handle high winds, extreme temperatures, and rugged climates in all types of communities around the world. The device can be deployed by a single person and at a range of heights — from a pole only a few feet off the ground to a tall tower or tree.” The split architecture mirrors the wider moves towards virtualized clusters of small cells, particularly to support indoor coverage and capacity. Small Cell Forum recently published nFAPI, an extension of its FAPI interface, which allows small cells from different vendors to interoperate. nFAPI applies the idea to a centralized baseband unit (BBU) which can control a cluster of radio/antennas (theoretically in a multivendor system). Facebook’s idea is similar, but fully open source. "Many people might not realize that running their own cellular networks is not only possible but also doesn’t require substantial technical expertise" – Khashif Ali, Facebook Its platform has been design tested in Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California and outdoor tests are now in process, while Facebook will work with OEMs and ODMs to ensure wide availability of OpenCellular once it goes commercial. Terragraph and Aries Terragraph, like Open Cellular (but more futuristic), is targeted at building low cost cellular and WiFi small cells, but this time in dense urban environments. Complementing this, in a different layer of the RAN, is Project Aries, a concept design for a Massive MIMO macrocell for rural areas. Terragraph will make heavy use of WiGig, the Wi-Fi-like network for 60 GHz spectrum, and the nodes, which can be mounted on lamp posts or buildings, will use low cost chips and components, says Facebook. It claims Terragraph has an innovative routing protocol for im-roved collision detection and greater reliability, plus “SDN-like” cloud controllers to handle large numbers of cells efficiently and flexibly, targeting capacity where it is required at any one time. The system can support multi-Gbps links and is IPv6-only. Terra-graph is being trialled in San Jose, California. The first Project Aries (Antenna Radio Integration for Efficiency in Spectrum), prototype supports 96 antennas and 24 data streams, targeting spectral efficiency of 100bits/sec/Hz. So far, Facebook has demonstrated Aries at 71bps/Hz. Meanwhile, Facebook continues to experiment with new ways to backhaul its remote cells. It can be assumed that OpenCellular will be able to work as the terrestrial portion of Facebook’s various test networks involving drones or satellites with upload to the aerial device without the need for handsets to communicate directly with them. That would enable commodity cellphones to be used, further lowering costs for consumers and providers. Facebook engineer Kashif Ali wrote in a Facebook Code post at the time of OpenCellular’s launch in July: “The hardware was designed with simplicity in mind, to encourage people to deploy their own cellular networks. Many people might not realize that running their own cellular networks is not only possible but also doesn’t require substantial technical expertise.” Web giants target the heart of the network In that sentence lies the opportunity for a low cost approach to ubiquitous internet access – for things as well as people as the IoT develops – but also the threat to traditional operators and suppliers. The threat to established vendors is obvious, but there are also risks to the MNOs from new competitors which can start from scratch with low cost infrastructure and pursue a new business model. The web giants are used to making massive hardware investments, and they know how to get their money back on them – still largely through advertising - something mobile operators have yet to figure out, since they are stuck with a direct correlation between the capacity they build and the dollars they can charge for each Gbyte and Mbps of that capacity. Facebook and Google start from a very different place. At the Facebook F8 developer conference in April, CEO Mark Zuckerberg out-lined a 10-year roadmap to connect the whole world with its services, messages and APIs. This spans technologies at every point in the chain, including apps, robotics and artificial intelligence, and the network itself. Like Google, Facebook presumably does not want to be a network vendor, a modern version of Ericsson, but is showing the ecosystem what can be done, and hoping OEMs – old or new – will take its ideas and turn them into large-scale commercial systems. “It is not our intent to build and maintain and deploy these networks ourselves. We want to advance the state of the art,” said Jay Parikh, VP of engineering at Facebook.

Just Google it How much solar energy can your roof make? Just Google it Posted on Thursday, November 17, 2016 by CNN in International News If you’ve ever thought about putting solar panels on your roof, you know that the process doesn’t exactly qualify as an impulse purchase. Typically, it involves multiple visits from solar installers. The standard practice in the industry is to go up on the rooftop with a fish-eye camera, then take a picture from each of the four corners to make an estimate of the solar potential of the roof. What if you could do that from your computer instead, and all by yourself? Enter Project Sunroof, a Google tool that uses high-resolution 3D data and artificial intelligence to allow you to do exactly that. A better (Google) Earth Project Sunroof shares some of its technology with the familiar Google Maps and Google Earth, and then adds its own spin to it. “The centerpiece of the technology is a 3D model of the world that does shadowcasting, which means that for every point of a roof we can determine whether there will be shade or not, for every time of the day, every day of the year,” Joel Conkling, Google’s principal of energy and sustainability, told CNN, from the COP22 climate change conference, in Marrakech. Users in covered areas — 42 US states and about 43 million buildings at the moment — can go to the Sunroof Project website, enter their address and see an estimate of the energy production potential of their roof right away, and the actual savings based on weather data (less sunny areas will yield less power) and the price of electricity from the local utility. “We connect directly to the providers, so customers can immediately get a quote. You can ask for your proposal within two minutes,” says Conkling. Machine learning To make this possible, Google uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze the data. “Our system can automatically identify buildings and then extract information about the roof, including how it’s angled, the direction it’s pointing, and whether there are trees in its vicinity,” said Conkling. The end result is at least as accurate as going up on the roof, according to Conkling. The only catch is that the source data must be very detailed: Project Sunroof doesn’t use satellite photos, because the resolution isn’t enough, but high quality imagery which is available only where Google has flown airplanes to collect aerial shots. “For that reason we probably won’t ever get to cover all the buildings in the US, or any country for that matter. That’s why we focus on the most populous areas,” said Conkling. “We hope to expand abroad but we have no concrete plans to do so as of yet. The data is available for around 30 to 40 other countries already.” UN award winner The project spawns from Google’s “20 Percent Time” scheme, which allows engineers at the company to spend one day a week on whatever they find interesting. The scheme has incubated some famous Google products, like Gmail and Google News. After launching in 2015 in just three cities, Project Sunroof has attracted millions of users so far, according to Conkling. It’s one of the winners of the 2016 United Nations “Momentum for Change” award, which every year shines a light on innovative, scalable and replicable examples of what people are doing to address climate change. As such, it was showcased at the UN’s climate change conference, COP22, in Marrakech, Morocco. New this year is something called the “Data Explorer:” whereas Sunroof’s original incarnation focuses on the solar potential of a specific house, the Data Explorer takes it up a level to aggregate data about a city, a county or a state. “It’s targeted at city or state leaders and other governmental figures who want to learn about the solar potential for their whole jurisdiction to set data driven solar policies,” said Conkling. Green commitment Google has a strong commitment to renewable energy. To date, it says it has invested $2.5 billion in wind and solar projects around the world, which can generate over 3.7 GW a year, enough to power one million US homes. It is the largest non-utility purchaser of renewable energy in the world. The company already powers 35 percent of its operations from renewables, with a goal of 100% by 2025.

Updated: Thursday, November 17, 2016, 15:17 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News Washington, Nov 16 Google and Facebook has moved to cut off advertising revenue to fake news sites, after a wave of criticism over the role misinformation played in the US presidential election. The move by the two tech giants aims to choke off funds to an industry fueled by bogus, often sensational "news" circulating online and seen as a potential influence on public opinion. A Google statement to AFP said new policies "will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies." The shift will mean Google restricts ads "on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," the statement said. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the company receives billions of queries daily and admitted errors had been made. "There have been a couple of incidences where it has been pointed out and we didn't get it right. And so it is a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it," he said in a BBC interview. Pichai said there should be "no situation where fake news gets distributed" and committed to making improvements. "I don't think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely," he said. On Monday, internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Republican Donald Trump had won the popular vote in addition to the electoral college. The numbers on a blog called 70News -- contradicting official results tallied so far by states -- said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. The blog urged those petitioning for the electoral college to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort. Facebook is implementing a similar policy, a spokesman said. "In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news," a Facebook statement said. "While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news." One report said Facebook had developed a tool to weed out fake news but did not deploy it before the US election, fearing a backlash from conservatives after a controversy over its handling of "trending topics." Facebook denied the report. Some critics have gone so far as to blame Facebook for enabling Trump's victory, saying it did not do enough to curb bogus news that appeared to help rally his supporters. Stories that went viral in the run-up to the vote included such headlines as "Hillary Clinton Calling for Civil War If Trump Is Elected" and "Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President." The prevalence of fake news has prompted calls for Facebook to consider itself a "media" company rather than a neutral platform, a move which would require it to make editorial judgments on articles. Facebook executives have repeatedly rejected this idea, but since the election have pledged to work harder to filter out hoaxes and misinformation. In a weekend post, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the notion that fake news helped sway the election, and said that "more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic." Still, he said that "we don't want any hoaxes on Facebook" and pledged to do more to curb fake news without censoring content.

"It was happening upstairs in our bedroom," Sally Evans said. "He was on his computer." A year after she learned of her son's death through pictures on the internet, Evans still wonders what could have prevented the 25-year-old's descent into extremism. More than 3,000 miles away, in a massive Manhattan office building, researchers at Google think they may have found an answer to that question. Thomas Evans Family photo Developers at Jigsaw, the tech giant's think-tank, are two months into a pilot project called Redirect, which aims to push web users searching for jihadist information toward content designed to counter the slick tools of terrorist recruitment. "There are people interested in ISIS' message on one side and there are videos that undermine ISIS' message on the other hand," said Yasmin Green, head of research and development at Jigsaw. "We are using targeted advertising to marry the two." "I think what we're seeing now is a recognition that tech companies have a moral obligation to not just stop their platforms being used for recruitment, but ... to actively prevent the radicalization" In traditional targeted advertising, a new mother searching for information on Google about getting a baby to sleep might start seeing ads for blankets and white-noise machines in their feeds. Through Redirect, someone searching for details about life as an ISIS fighter might be offered links to independently produced videos that detail hardships and dangers instead of the stirring Madison Avenue-style propaganda the terror group puts online. "So if you were looking for, let's say, material on the social welfare system in the so-called caliphate, you would click on the ad and see the truth about what's happening in Syria and Iraq," Green said. "The long food lines, the devastated suffering, the failure of the Islamic State."

In the first eight weeks, 300,000 people looking for ISIS information online were redirected. They watched a combined total of 425,000 minutes of video, which Green said was a surprisingly high level of engagement given the short attention spans of internet users and the ability to just click away from anything dissonant. The key is subtlety. A disaffected young person wondering if ISIS is the answer to their problems would immediately dismiss a video with a warning from the Department of Homeland Security. Instead, Jigsaw is looking for voices that will be seen as credible, such as imams, and a more measured tone. "We really need to engage them with content that isn't judgmental off the bat," Green said. Related: The Inside Story of an American ISIS Cell Sohail Ahmad said he knows first-hand how effective this approach can be. Raised by Pakistani immigrants in London's East End, his family's own hard-line views were reinforced by online videos and articles selling the idea that a global Muslim brotherhood could be achieved through jihad. "It was through Google searches and it was through using YouTube," Ahmad said. He became a student preacher, spewing fanaticism and hate. He said he despised America and began seriously thinking about carrying out a lone-wolf bombing attack in London. He never went through with it, and over time his views shifted. If Redirect had been in effect during his march toward extremism, he might not have gotten so far down the road, or turned back sooner. "What led me away from radicalism was kind of listening to more relatively moderate scholars and imams," he said. "And if I'd had access to that information, if I'd been exposed to that much earlier, I think I would have turned away from extremism at a much earlier stage as well." Sohail Ahmed tells NBC News' Ronan Farrow about his road to and away from radicalism. NBC News It's no secret that technology has revolutionized terrorism. Militants bombard social media with posts meant to entice the curious and malcontented. Companies that run those sites play a high-stakes game of whack-a-mole trying to remove material and disable accounts that just spring up again. "For recruiters who are based in conflict zones, they have a unique ability now to reach anybody, anywhere, at any time," said Shiraz Maher, senior research fellow at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King's College. But Rashad Ali, a reformed radical who is now a senior fellow for the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, said tech companies have even more power. "If you target your ads, we've found that you can go from reaching 500 people to 100,000 people in a matter of weeks," he said. "I think the potential for reaching people who are vulnerable is huge." Ali said tests he has conducted show that targeted ads can reach subjects on a deeper level, too: A dozen members of a far-right organization reached out to the makers of one counter-programming video and asked for help leaving the movement. "I've actually got no doubt that it can work," he said. "I think what we're seeing now is a recognition that tech companies have a moral obligation to not just stop their platforms being used for recruitment, but where and when they can, to actively prevent the radicalization," Ali added. "As someone who's been radicalized and been involved in recruiting other people, I think this is the least that Google can do." Google said it responds to requests for users' data from government agencies and courts "on an individual basis."

"There's advertising on all the other platforms," she said. "And there is a lot of really good material that's just not being seen by the right people," she said. Sally Evans doesn't know if something like Redirect would have made a difference for her son. She watched him morph from an average British teenager into a devout Muslim convert and then take a sharp turn toward zealotry. He got angry when bacon was cooked in the house and wouldn't walk into the room with the Christmas tree. Then he vanished for four months, resurfacing in January 2015 to tell his family in a phone call that he had joined the bloodthirsty al Shabab. Months later, he was dead — killed during a firefight with the Kenyan military. His mother has testified before Parliament and taken part in a TV documentary in an effort to raise awareness of radicalization and prevent other families from experiencing the hell she's gone through. If Google and Redirect can help, she's all for it. "Anything's worth trying, isn't it?" she said. "Anything to try and put a stop to it."

Technology giant Google Inc. may soon have an answer for this massive yet understated issue. Google in association with the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) is launching a Google Toilet Locator which will help people find the nearest and cleanest toilets around them, according to a report in International Business Times (IBT). The toilet locator will be available on Google Maps and will be piloted in Delhi-NCR for 15 days from November 16 to November 30. MoUD is also celebrating Swachhata Pakhwada, or Cleanliness Fortnight during the same period. Users will be required to open Google Maps, and then search for toilets near them using a variety of keyword including ‘toilet’, ‘lavatory’, ‘swach’, ‘swachhata’, ‘shulabh’ or ‘shauchalay’, after which Google will point them to the nearest toilets. The system will rely heavily on crowd-sourced information to provide information about the ratings and timings of a toilet. The MoUD is already in process of rolling out this facility in the NCR region and the toilets would include not only the public restrooms or Sulabh Shauchalays in the area, but also those in public places like metro stations, malls, petrol pumps and hospitals, told a MoUD official who wished to be quoted anonymously. However there is no word on when the service would be launched in the other parts of the country. “Mechanisms are in place for the facility to be scaled up, and for it to reach all the 2,041 urban local bodies (ULBs) of the country,” told a MoUD official to IBT.

Brendon Petersen You might be surprised that the phone that seems to beat them all isn’t even from a ‘traditional manufacturer’. The smartphone market is made up of two big players, Samsung and Apple. Recently, however, Google has joined the ranks. The smartphone market has largely been dominated by two big players, Samsung and Apple. This, in turn, has split users among two OS camps, namely iOS and Android. With Samsung having suffered a recent stumble and Apple’s iPhone 7 less impressive than people were expecting, there was finally the possibility of a third name to step into the spotlight. Many people would’ve expected that to be the world’s third-largest handset manufacturer, Huawei. But surprisingly, it’s turned out to be Google. The Google Pixel The search giant (which also happens to own the Android OS) has tried its hand at making hardware before. But it has never reached the same level of success as Apple or Samsung. Its previous range of Nexus devices were a partnership between Google and Android OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) intended to show off the full potential of the Android OS. That didn’t quite work out as expected. So Google finally took matters into its own hands and created the new Pixel, which forms part of its “Made by Google” strategy. The phone itself was made by HTC, but Google controlled the entire design process. The result? A phone that international tech reviewers are hailing as the best phone ever made. That’s quite a lofty claim for a phone that bears a striking resemblance to Apple’s iPhone and whose main drawcard is its AI (named Google Assistant). Pixel vs Samsung vs Apple In a pure head-to-head specs comparison, here’s how the Google Pixel XL stacks up against the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the iPhone 7 Plus. .

With the latest update, Google's AI-powered Allo messenger can now help you pick that perfect sticker or emoji to convey your emotion. In addition, the messenger now comes with an exclusive "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" sticker pack along with new themes. Smart Smiley in Google Allo helps users pick and send the perfect sticker or emoji based on the sentiment of the conversation. After you finish typing the message, tap on the Smart Smiley button and Allo will bring you suggestions of relevant emojis and stickers to convey the thought. For example, if you are talking about having dinner with your family, Allo will suggest food emojis and stickers to finish the sentence. And it's not just functionality. When you type, "see you later", Allo will spring an Alligator emoji to go with that, to keep your cool quotient high. Also, Allo now comes with a variety of themes to choose from. Different colours and patterns like "watermelon" or "sorbet" can now adorn your chat screen. What's more, Allo now offers the option of downloading exclusive "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" stickers featuring characters and creatures from the upcoming Warner Bros. film from the Harry Potter franchise. It is also easier now to download new sticker packs. Now, you just simply have to tap on a sticker sent by a friend in chat to download it directly from the sticker marketplace. Google's Allo messenger launched earlier this year.

By Roger Baird November 17, 2016 09:13 GMT Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has led the firm since August 2015, after boosting the firm's browser and mobile businessesReuters Google's plans to almost double the size of its London headquarters were announced by chief executive, Sundar Pichai, part of an elite club of Indian-born leaders at the forefront of the world's largest tech firms. Pichai, 44, took the top job at Google last August after being marked out as a rising star of the web browser giant he joined in 2004. Another Indian-born hotshot is Satya Nadella, who was appointed to the top job at Microsoft in 2014, valued at $461bn (£370bn), replacing the long-standing chief executive Steve Balmer. Google said it plans to build a 10-storey, 650,000 square foot complex alongside its new offices in Pancras Square, creating around 3,000 jobs and boosting its investment in the UK by around £1bn by 2020. Pichai said: "Here in the UK, it's clear to me that computer science has a great future with the talent, educational institutions, and passion for innovation we see all around us." The trained engineer took the helm at Google as part of its reorganisation which saw it create a holding company called Alphabet. On one side of the holding company is the vastly profitable Google, and on the other are dozens of blue-sky projects the group hope might one day make money. Alphabet's market value is $532bn, with virtually all of that accounted for by Google. "This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google," the firm's co-founder Larry Page wrote in a blog that surprised the industry last year. "A key part of this is Sundar Pichai." April's Fool The soft-spoken Pichai started at Google on April Fool's Day in 2004, building the now defunct Google toolbar. It gave users of Internet Explorer and Firefox, the dominant browsers at the time, easy access to Google search. Pichai during the keynote address to Google developers at a Conference in the Moscone Center in San FranciscoReuters But Pichai said that Google should build its own browser and won the support of the company's co-founders, Page and Sergey Brin. However, the then chief executive Eric Schmidt, thought that joining the browser wars would be an expensive distraction. That browser went on to become Google Chrome which proved fast and ensured that web users had direct access to Google's search engine and its profitable advertising. Chrome became the dominant browser on the web. Pichai took charge of the firm's Chrome business, and in 2013 was also put in charge of its mobile unit, which covered the group's Android services to firms such as Samsung, LG and HTC. "Sundar has a talent for creating products that are technically excellent yet easy to use – and he loves a big bet," Page wrote in another blog when he promoted Pichai. A year after taking up the new mobile role, and smoothing relationships with suppliers and frictions the unit had with other parts of the group, Google was shipped in one billion mobile devices worldwide. Moves to the US The chess-loving Pichai was born in the port city of Chennai, capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. His father, Regunatha Pichai, worked as an electrical engineer for Britain's General Electric Company. He was educated at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur, where he studied engineering. He won a scholarship to Stanford University in the US to study materials science and semiconductor physics. Pichai lived with a host family during his first year and spent much of time missing his girlfriend, Anjali, who later joined him in America and is now his wife. They have two children. Pichai had planned to get a Ph.D. at Stanford and pursue an academic career. But he accepted a job as an engineer and product manager at Applied Materials, a Silicon Valley semiconductor maker. He went on to get an MBA from the Wharton School of Business in 2002 and worked as a consultant at McKinsey and Company, before arriving at Google. Four to a scooter Even though Pichai came from a middle-class background that still meant privations in India. His family did not get a telephone until he was 12. And a family day out meant four of them travelling on a blue Lambretta scooter – his father driving, Sundar standing at the front, and his younger brother perched on the back of the seat with their mother. It is a safe bet that the Pichai family now travel in much grander style.

Google's telling you to. Sam Machkovech I stood at the peak of Mount Rainier, the tallest mountain in Washington state. The sounds of wind whipped past my ears, and mountains and valleys filled a seemingly endless horizon in every direction. I'd never seen anything like it—until I grabbed the sun. Using my HTC Vive virtual reality wand, I reached into the heavens in order to spin the Earth along its normal rotational axis, until I set the horizon on fire with a sunset. I breathed deeply at the sight, then spun our planet just a little more, until I filled the sky with a heaping helping of the Milky Way Galaxy. Virtual reality has exposed me to some pretty incredible experiences, but I've grown ever so jaded in the past few years of testing consumer-grade headsets. Google Earth VR, however, has dropped my jaw anew. This, more than any other game or app for SteamVR's "room scale" system, makes me want to call every friend and loved one I know and tell them to come over, put on a headset, and warp anywhere on Earth that they please. Jetpack mode, engage First stop: My hometown of Seattle. First stop: My hometown of Seattle. Clicking to get closer in a bird's eye perspective. At every altitude, different labels appear. I might have had my other wand hand backwards to emulate a baseball batter's stance. No telling. "The crowd goes wild! Awwwshhhzzzhhhtttrawwwrr!" (That's me making fake crowd noise sounds with my mouth. Just, you know, enjoying a sunset that I created WITH MY HANDS. Be warned: Not every place in Google Earth VR is rendered with so much 3D data. For example, here's me hanging out in eerily flat Pyongyang. (Then again, I wouldn't put it past Kim Jong Un to have flattened much of North Korea as some sort of bizarre supreme-leader ruling.) Google Earth VR, which is currently a free exclusive for HTC Vive owners, will look familiar to anybody who has used Google's "Earth" mapping apps before. You can grab the globe, zoom in and out anywhere, and see finer details as you zoom closer to any location. But this VR variant differs largely in that it reveals just how much 3D-mapped content the app really has—and displays it as handsomely as its limited system possibly can. Take, for example, my casual flyover near Seattle's Centurylink Field. I launched the app while floating high above the planet Earth and was instructed to use the Vive wands to move around. One button zoomed me closer, while another let me "grab" the planet and reorient it. I used these motions to spin the globe towards North America, then the USA, then Washington, until I was close enough to trigger a perspective shift. Before, I was looking down from a bird's eye view; now, I was more level, like a guy in a jetpack flying over a city and checking it out. With a few more taps, I was no longer flying; I was on ground level at "average adult height." This is where Google Earth VR gets cool. After flying toward Seattle's football stadium, I thought it might be fun to walk through it. And I could. A few taps later, I was there, on the 50-yard line, throwing my hands up like some ridiculous version of Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman. The reason this felt fun is because so much of the stadium's interior geometry had been rendered precisely—and the same went for the Seattle baseball stadium on the next block. Google Earth has juiced its assets up with 3D material that almost certainly wasn't captured solely from a satellite above, and that really sells the "I'm really there" feeling that you might expect. Some of Google Earth VR's content looks really, really crappy, though. Squishy geometry and fuzzy textures will make some of your favorite real-life locations look like they've been ripped out of an N64 game. But being able to stand around at one-for-one scale with a famed building, landmark, or national park and get lost in the full, 360-degree feeling that everything nearby is at least rendered at total proportionate accuracy helps wash the squishy geometry down. (Be warned: this level of detail does not apply to much of the non-Western world within Google Earth VR. You'll have a lot better luck finding fully rendered geometry in American cities than in others.) A quick detour to Burning Man Menus make it easy to pick out known landmarks. Menus make it easy to pick out known landmarks. Google HQ? Fine, let's go. I can aim a pointer at the miniature globe floating above my left hand at any time to quickly back out and warp elsewhere. Peace out, Google. Kazakhstan, here we come. Google Earth VR also uses clever tricks to keep users feeling comfortable while they're spinning and warping their nearby environs. You'll use the Vive wand as a pointer and grabber to transform your scale or location in the app—and while you do that, the view shrinks to a tiny periscope view until the motion has settled. It's still possible to make yourself queasy by grabbing and moving the Earth too quickly, but that sensation is easy to immediately halt, at least. Otherwise, motion takes place in controllable bursts, as opposed to swimmy, dizzying "flight" paths. (In other words, don't be worried by how sickening the app's official demo trailer looks.) Pre-loaded coordinates appear in a simple menu interface, and new users will want to warp around the Earth with these for some of the app's most spectacular locations. The list is long and is full of landmarks like Big Ben, national parks like Yosemite, oddball spots like the deserts of Burning Man, and even a few outer-space locations (like a floating spot from which you can see a solar eclipse). The nifty "tours" tab will automatically and comfortably warp Vive novices through a series of global locations based on a certain theme ("water," "parks"), and I found these particularly soothing, since they wrest control from users during a 3-5 minute time span to show off a variety of worldwide locales. The worst aspect of Google Earth VR in its launch state is an inability to type in cities, landmarks, or other custom coordinates. If you want to go to, say, your childhood home in VR, you'll have to grab the planet yourself and pick through roads, landmarks, and terrain until you find the old homestead at 227 Charleston Avenue. In my case, I struggled to find my childhood home for a while, especially when I mistook my old middle school for my old high school. Google Earth VR displays city names and landmark names, but roads and smaller details go unlabeled. (Once you find a spot, you can bookmark it for a quick return, at least.) That hindrance, and the fact that some content renders quite weirdly, are worth tempering expectations over. The Statue of Liberty and Fenway Park are not perfect replicas here. But even these feel cool to fly over and walk through, and you can warp between them and far more convincingly rendered outdoor scenes with just a few clicks. Expect to lose at least an hour just flying around the Earth—and the immediate future fantasizing about where you'll warp next time you put a Vive on. Google says this will remain an HTC Vive exclusive indefinitely. What's the best VR headset for you? We find out via a series of totally objective, 100 percent useful tests. Maybe.

Don’t know if a particular emoji exists? Not sure which emoji packs the best punch for the occasion? Don’t worry if you can’t figure it out because Allo can and will. The Smart Smiley button will suggest the best smileys, emojis, and even stickers for your conversation or message so you won’t have to worry about expressing yourself better. Plus, it also has new stickers to mark the premiere of newest Harry Potter-esque film. Google Allo’s purpose is to let you talk more while tapping less. To be less vague, that means that the messenger will offer words or phrases that it thinks are the best responses for a given context. But online conversations these aren’t just made up of words. Emojis and stickers are all the rage but despite having dozens if not hundreds of such graphical representations, we only use 3% of them, according to surveys. The reason for that, the theory goes, is that we usually can’t find the right emoji for the right moment. Finding a needle in a haystack is appropriate for this case. So just as Allo wants to help you tap words less, it also wants to help look for the right image for the job. While typing your message, tap on the Smart Smiley to bring up suggested emojis for the context. What if you haven’t even typed anything yet? Allo will then base its suggestions on the flow of the conversation. Allo’s suggestions work for both emojis as well as stickers. Which is just perfect for the new Fantastic Beasts set that just landed. It’s not going to turn you into a wizard, but it’s probably going to make you sound, or look rather, like one. And in case you can’t find it, you can easily download sticker packs when someone sends one to you that you don’t have yet. Yes, that’s a new feature as well. The magic doesn’t end there. Google Allo now also has a new set of background themes for your viewing pleasure, mostly themed around mouthwatering sweets like Watermelon and Sorbet. These new features are rolling out to both Android and iOS devices so that no one will ever have to worry about having a proper emoji when the chance calls for it.

How to recognise different types of trees / posts / Replacing proprietary Play Services with MicroG Recent Comments Archives 2 comments | Edit Preferences New post For over a year now, I have been using CyanogenMod in my Nexus phone. At first I just installed some bundle that brought all the proprietary Google applications and libraries, but later I decided that I wanted more control over it, so I did a clean install with no proprietary stuff. This was not so great at the beginning, because the base system lacks the geolocation helpers that allow you to get a position in seconds (using GSM antennas and Wifi APs). And so, every time I opened OsmAnd (a great maps application, free software and free maps), I would have to wait minutes for the GPS radio to locate enough satellites. Shortly after, I found about the UnifiedNLP project that provided a drop-in replacement for the location services, using pluggable location providers. This worked great, and you could choose to use the Apple or Mozilla on-line providers, or off-line databases that you could download or build yourself. This worked well for most of my needs, and I was happy about it. I also had F-droid for installing free software applications, DAVdroid for contacts and calendar synchronisation, K9 for reading email, etc. I still needed some proprietary apps, but most of the stuff in my phone was Free Software. But sadly, more and more application developers are buying into the vendor lock-in that is Google Play Services, which is a set of APIs that offer some useful functionality (including the location services), but that require non-free software that is not part of the AOSP (Android Open-Source Project). Mostly, this is because they make push notifications a requirement, or because they want you to be able to buy stuff from the application. This is not limited to proprietary software. Most notably, the Signal project refuses to work without these libraries, or even to distribute the pre-compiled binaries on any platform that is not Google Play! (This is one of many reason why I don't recommend Signal to anybody). And of course, many very useful services that people use every day require you to install proprietary applications, which care much less about your choices of non-standard platforms. For the most part, I had been able to just get the package files for these applications1 from somewhere, and have the functionality I wanted. Some apps would just work perfectly, others would complain about the lack of Play Services, but offer a degraded experience. You would not get notifications unless you re-opened the application, stuff like that. But they worked. Lately, some of the closed-source apps I sometimes use stopped working altogether. So, tired of all this, I decided to give the MicroG project a try. MicroG MicroG is a direct descendant of UnifiedNLP and the NOGAPPS project. I had known about it for a while, but the installation procedures always put me off. LWN published an article about them recently, and so I decided to spend a good chunk of time making it work. This blog post is to help making this a bit less painful. Some prerequisites: No Gapps installed. Rooted phone (at least for the mechanism I describe here). Working ADB with root access to the phone. UnifiedNLP needs to be uninstalled (MicroG carries its own version of it). Signature spoofing The main problem with the installation, is that MicroG needs to pretend to be the original Google bundle. It has to show the same name, but most importantly, it has to spoof its cryptographic signatures so other applications do not realise it is not the real thing. OmniROM and MarshROM (other alternative firmwares for Android) provide support for signature spoofing out of the box. If you are running these, go ahead and install MicroG, it will be very easy! Sadly, the CyanogenMod refused allowing signature spoofing, citing security concerns2, so most users will have to go the hard way. The options for enabling this feature are basically two: either patch some core libraries H4xx0r style, or use the "Xposed framework". Since I still don't really understand what this Xposed thing is, and it is one of these projects that distributes files on XDA forums, I decided to go the dirty way. Patching the ROM Note: this method requires a rooted phone, java, and adb. The MicroG wiki links to three different projects for patching your ROM, but turns out that two of them would not work at all with CyanogenMod 11 and 13 (the two versions I tried), because the system is "odexed" (whatever that means, the Android ecosystem is really annoying). I actually upgraded CM to version 13 just to try this, so a couple of hours went there, with no results. The project that did work is Haystack by Lanchon, which seems to be the cleaner and better developed of the three. Also the one with the most complex documentation. In a nutshell, you need to download a bunch of files from the phone, apply a series of patches to it, and then reupload it. To obtain the files and place them in the maguro (the codename for my phone) directory: $ ./pull-fileset maguro
 Now you need to apply some patches with the patch-fileset script. The patches are located in the patches directory: $ ls patches
sigspoof-core
sigspoof-hook-1.5-2.3
sigspoof-hook-4.0
sigspoof-hook-4.1-6.0
sigspoof-hook-7.0
sigspoof-ui-global-4.1-6.0
sigspoof-ui-global-7.0
 The patch-fileset script takes these parameters: patch-fileset <patch-dir> <api-level> <input-dir> [ <output-dir> ]
 Note that this requires knowing your Android version, and the API level. If you don't specify an output directory, it will append the patch name to the input directory name. Note that you should also check the output of the script for any warnings or errors! First, you need to apply the patch that hooks into your specific version of Android (6.0, API level 23 in my case): $ ./patch-fileset patches/sigspoof-hook-4.1-6.0 23 maguro
>>> target directory: maguro__sigspoof-hook-4.1-6.0
[...]
*** patch-fileset: success
 Now, you need to add the core spoofing module: $ ./patch-fileset patches/sigspoof-core 23 maguro__sigspoof-hook-4.1-6.0
>>> target directory: maguro__sigspoof-hook-4.1-6.0__sigspoof-core
[...]
*** patch-fileset: success
 And finally, add the UI elements that let you enable or disable the signature spoofing: $ ./patch-fileset patches/sigspoof-ui-global-4.1-6.0 23 maguro__sigspoof-hook-4.1-6.0__sigspoof-core
>>> target directory: maguro__sigspoof-hook-4.1-6.0__sigspoof-core__sigspoof-ui-global-4.1-6.0
[...]
*** patch-fileset: success
 Now, you have a bundle ready to upload to your phone, and you do that with the push-fileset script: $ ./push-fileset maguro__sigspoof-hook-4.1-6.0__sigspoof-core__sigspoof-ui-global-4.1-6.0
 After this, reboot your phone, go to settings / developer settings, and at the end you should find a checkbx for "Allow signature spoofing" which you should now enable. Installing MicroG Now that the difficult part is done, the rest of the installation is pretty easy. You can add the MicroG repository to F-Droid and install the rest of the modules from there. Check the installation guide for all the details. Once all the parts are in place, and after a last reboot, you should find a MicroG settings icon that will check that everything is working correctly, and give you the choice of which components to enable. So far, other applications believe this phone has nothing weird, I get quick GPS fixes, push notifications seem to work... Not bad at all for such a young project! Hope this is useful. I would love to hear your feedback in the comments! Which is a pretty horrible thing, having to download from fishy sites because Google refuses to let you use the marketplace without their proprietary application. I used to use a chrome extension to trick Google Play into believing your phone was downloading it, and so you could get the APK file, but now that I have no devices running stock Android, that does not work any more. ↩ Actually, I am still a bit concerned about this, because it is not completely clear to me how protected this is against malicious actors (I would love to get feedback on this!). ↩ RSS Atom apk downloaders for downloading apks from the play store on linux, I've succesfully used raccon and googleplaydownloader. Comment by gregor+www-0601 — Thu 17 Nov 2016 07:52:37 GMT comment 2 Hi Martin, Using microg/nogapps for around 4-5 years now and also very happy! Signature spoofing allows microg to replace google play service by giving microg the same signature. Google implemented a forced dependency model in Android which gives app suppliers the power to create a dependency on a company instead of a library. This makes conditional sale possible and easy. If I am correct, the signature spoofing patch only allows microg+blankstore and not other apps to replace google play service. Personnally I think it would even be better if you had the freedom to redefine all dependencies yourself and get rid of the possibility of conditional sale entirely. It is up to the user to decide what company to use and not the supplier. There is no extra danger from malicious actors with the patch unless you download an app with a microg signature and give that app the signature spoofing permission. I think this risk is equal or less to the risk of downloading an app which has a Google signature. Cyanogen's argument is solely based on the idea that google play services should not be replaced by another app, even if it is disabled by default and the user has to explicitly enable it a couple of times. End of cyanogen argument. Since then I am avoiding cyanogenmod when possible. Very happy with Omnirom right now. Best!

Email Address:  ‘Google Earth VR’ Launches on HTC Vive, A Breathtaking New Way to Know Our Planet By Ben Lang - Nov 16, 2016 34 818SHARES FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedinSubscribe The Entire VR Industry in One Little Email The Daily Roundup is our comprehensive coverage of the VR industry wrapped up into one daily email, delivered directly to your inbox.  Email Address Today Google launches Earth VR for the HTC Vive for free, giving us a whole new perspective on the world. I remember, back in 2001, how amazed I was to see Google Earth for the first time. I remember huddling around the computer monitor with friends shouting “go to New York City!” “Go to Hawaii!” “Go to the Grand Canyon!”, and with a line of text and a tap on the return key, we were there, as the digital globe spun and zoomed in smoothly to give us a previously unseen view of these exotic locales. Google Earth made the world tangible in a way we’d never known it. 15 years later, in Google’s San Francisco office, I felt that same magic. Except this time, I could not only fly from one place to another for a bird’s-eye view, I could zoom down and plant my feet on the ground with the entire Earth encompassing my view. I don’t use the word “breathtaking” in headlines often. But when you find yourself towering over a detailed recreation of San Francisco, or standing eye-level with the top of the Eiffel Tower, or watching the Sun set and the Milky Way rise over the plateaus of Monument Valley, it’s an easy choice. Launching today on the HTC Vive for free, Google Earth VR lets you touch and explore an incredible dataset—high-res satellite imagery, aerial photography, and photogrammetric recreations of major cities—all seamlessly integrated into a single model of our planet. SEE ALSO HTC Announces Vive 'Business Edition' for $1200 Donning the HTC Vive, you’ll find yourself first looking at a small version of the planet set against a black backdrop of space. Using the Vive’s controllers, you can hold the top half of the right trackpad to zoom in toward the planet. As you zoom in you’ll being to see labels of countries, and even closer, states, cities, and towns. At this point though, you’re still flying face-first toward the ground; as you get closer you’ll want to tap the left trackpad which will flip your perspective 90 degrees so that your horizon becomes that of the planet’s surface. Now it feels like you’re walking on the planet like a giant, and you can continue to zoom down to your destination. You might suspect that flying all the way from down from space and then shifting your horizon 90 degrees would get dizzying in VR, but Google Earth VR employs a smart locomotion method (which doesn’t rely on teleporting). You’ll fly in whatever direction you point your controller and as you do you’ll see that the peripheral field of view shrinks around your center of vision, revealing a static grid around you. When you stop again, the view will expand to fill the scene as before. It’s a solution that works impressively well, even as you grab the earth below you and drag it along to move from one town to the next. It also keeps you more immersed in the experience by actually letting you traverse from place to place, rather than just appearing there. And, thankfully for those not prone to any VR motion sickness, you can turn off the shrinking view entirely, letting you fly about with the fully expanded scene around you. SEE ALSO HTC Just Earmarked $100 Million to Invest in VR Content, Applications Open Today Once you do get down to ground level, you’ll find that most anywhere on the planet has high-resolution satellite imagery and elevation data. If you visit some of the world’s biggest cities, you’ll find them fully modeled in 3D. When I first tried the experience at Google’s offices in San Francisco, I knew I had to see the city itself from within Earth VR. So I zoomed down until I was the size of a small skyscraper and walked around the 3D recreation like I was a giant. I could lean down to peer at the streets between buildings, or stand next to the cities skyscrapers. I could see the Giant’s stadium and, off in the distance, the Golden Gate Bridge. It’s a really spectacular way to experience something you know in an entirely new way. And it isn’t just cities; some areas of Earth VR, like Yosemite National Park, are modeled down to the individual tree, making the view all the more rich when you grab the virtual Sun and spin it down on the horizon to bathe the park in a beautiful sunset. Dial the sun a little bit further down and you’ll see the Moon and stars rise over Half Dome. For the time being, there’s no search function in Earth VR, so your journey is mostly manual exploration. Though once you find somewhere you like, you can bookmark it by taking a virtual photo which will be stored in your Saved menu and can be returned to at any time. There’s also several pre-installed guided tours which take you to scenic locations and even give an ambient soundtrack to make things that much more serene. One day I imagine such guided tours could have voice-overs that teach you something about each place you visit. SEE ALSO Oculus Rift: What You Really Get for Your Money The company has done an impressive job of bringing Google Earth to VR. It feels robust. The development team sells me that the app is built so that it will continually benefit from improvements in the Google Earth dataset over time, and that, “Earth VR is a product, not a demo,” one that they plan to continue adding to after launch. I hope that one of the top features on their post-launch list is social functionality. Earth VR is breathtaking, but when you’re in the headset alone you can sometimes feel like you’re the only one on the planet. Unfortunately, Google Earth VR is a Vive only experience for now. Although SteamVR supports the Rift, the developers have chosen not to support the headset at this time, and aren’t saying if or when they might. It isn’t clear if the decision was technical (perhaps because they wanted to prioritize getting Google Earth’s rendering engine working first with one headset, or maybe because Oculus hasn’t yet launched Touch controllers) or political (Google and Oculus are competing on the mobile front between Gear VR and Daydream).

TAGS Earth VR google earth virtual reality google earth vr htc vive Ben Lang Raphael Looks good. DiGiCT Ltd +1 for google sntxrrr can’t wait to get home to go globetrotting! Zach Mauch This is amazing. Has anyone found deeper settings in the program? I would like to optimize the loading. dogtato Seems awesome already, but I’d love some gameplay. Maybe an updated “where in the world is carmen san diego” Glaubenskrieger I wonder if this will be filtered like their search results. jlschmugge Any news of a Rift version when touch comes out? Rick VIVE only sadly, Google locked the app itself. whitedragon101@gmail.com I am crossing my fingers that when Google say “only availale on HTC Vive at this time” that the “at this time” part is a hint that they have a Rift version ready for the release of Oculus Touch Raphael It’s Google and it’s out for Vive… why wouldn’t they unlock for Octopus when it’s finally a complete system. Blame Octopus for being so slow with touch. jlschmugge Huh, I was wondering how long it would take for me to complain about Vive exclusivity, not counting wand only games of course. Today’s the day. Any one up for programming DeVive? NoMoreRoom But Rift doesn’t have touch yet, they prob didn’t want to code to a controller as well as the motion controllers i’m sure it will be compatible once they are released. Funny to see Rift users upset about exclusivity though. RationalThought Why? Rift users didn’t CHOOSE for it to have exclusive deals? I am sure most would prefer an open environment. Better for every one. NoMoreRoom I’m sure a lot of Rift users do want an open ENV but that is what the Vive is about, HTC/Vive hasn’t made anything exclusive (google did this time, maybe) but Oculus sure has done their best to wall off their market and pay devs to not release on other systems. Get Schwifty! HTC/Valve is “open” but not necessarily level… you can be sure FB/Oculus is the last of their concerns, which is why FB/Oculus use exclusives to help build appeal for an alternate platform; they’d be fools to trust their baby to a partnership that is a clear competition. Nicholas You mean those same Rift users that keep boasting how the Rift has much better exclusives than the Vive? The same ones that say the Vive is just full of “tech demos”? Yeah. Whatever. jlschmugge I knew this day was coming, I was actually more upset back in April that no Vive owner had the foresight to know things will work in their favour someday. People are impatient Gimme Gimmes. I’ll wait and see what happens when touch is out. Billy H Revive has already released a workaround for Rift users Get Schwifty! I would expect it sooner or later, but as the article pointed out the competition between Google and Facebook is an issue currently. Seems exclusives are not just an issue with Oculus… ummm… i see your point. maybe google is teaching facebook a lesson. they typically dont wall themselves off. anyhow, i think the mudslinging is not helpful and im not sure you arent comparing apples to oranges. afterall google earth isn’t an htc product. was google paid for exclusivity? did they say it wasn’t coming. the touch isn’t even OUT yet. chaos_in_ashland I just tried it, and it’s awesome. MosBen I wish that there was a way to go all the way down to human-size; to really be in a place. user not with today’s technology. even if they use the footage of their satellites it’s still “<90 cm imagery resolution". so no details in human scale. Joel Cullum Details would suck, but they should allow you to do it at least to get a scale of things. I visited the Grand canyon on here and needed to be human size to really appreciate the depth. NoMoreRoom You can enable it in the options. I tried it, not that impressive. Its just not detailed enough. felixcox You can by going into the menu. It allows you to seamless scale down to 1:1 size on the surface. It’s incredible, but unfortunately, google has not yet integrated streetview data, so most things are very very low resolution. Trees up close are nothing more than blocky triangles, cars are lumpy cartoony approximations. But in big cities, you still get an awesome sense of scale. It’s just incredibly mind-blowing to have so many locations that you can see in 3d from so many angles. Sebastien Mathieu wow!! can’t wait to get home to try this!!!! Texazzpete Strangely, the usual suspects aren’t in here complaining about exclusivity, since it’s swinging the other way. Stefan Eckhardt Next step: PS VR! One can always dream… RationalThought Shame…..I was hoping the rest of the industry would continue to shame Oculus into complying with the market but alas…..exclusivity it is. (Sony being the main culprit of this in all fairness) Jerald Doerr I almost cried using this… thank you Google for the free awesome software …. I checked out every house I lived in… it’s crazy flying around the hills and streets are used to live around in San Diego ….. saving locations feeling like the jolly green giant … even more so having powers like Ant Man and growing from 6′ to 6 tho used feet walking from San Diego to Northern California…. Thank you google! You guys did a kick a$$ job and didn’t even try to milk $.99 out of us! chtan Tried it yesterday night. It’s really breathtaking, grand and majestic. Killer app for Vive. Scott Nebeker I full acknowledgement that I’m spitting hairs but some smartass is going to come here, write this and feel smug and ain’t no one feelin’ smug but me. You mention using Google Earth in 2001 and YOU ARE RIGHT. It just wasn’t purchased by Google and called “Google Earth” until 2005. I’m putting this up here because putting 2001 can cause confusion for those that have read Google’s shiny new blog, ‘The Keyword’: goo.gl/JbGd6g -OR- those a-hole analists like myself. Anyway, good journalism, good style, keep it up! As they say in the military: “As you was.” Zaphod Beeblewurdle You know what would be *really* cool (are you listening google?) would be the ability to mark the location you are at IRL plus an orientation and then superimpose a “live” avatar or stick figure at that location (it would be an abstract looking interior space I guess, but the dimensions could be got from chaperone data, right?) . You could start in your room then zoom right out through the roof and go exploring. It might add an extra immersive boost :) Trending Features ‘Google Earth VR’ Launches on HTC Vive, A Breathtaking New Way to Know Our Planet Ben Lang - Nov 16, 2016 8359 34 ‘Thumper’ Review 2331 5 Where to Try Vive, PSVR, Rift, Touch, Gear VR, and Daydream for Free Ben Lang - Nov 11, 2016 3791 1 Google Daydream Review: Casual VR Closes the Gap Ben Lang - Nov 10, 2016 9961 13 Facebook Details Social VR Avatar Experiments and Lessons Learned Ben Lang - Nov 1, 2016 4668 11 © Road to VR

Consumers now start their trip research elsewhere, such as on Facebook or Apple TV, or they may book via a reviews website like TripAdvisor or a metasearch site like Skyscanner – among other alternative sources of inspiration and listings. But Google would like you to know that, in the US, it has seen hotel-related searches increase by about 25%, when comparing July 2016 versus July 2015 data. The company is hoping to monetize more of that search volume. In the past week, it made an incremental, but telling, update. It has refreshed its Hotel Ads website to let hotel managers filter by their preferred language and pricing model (such as its one-year-old commission model) to reach the partners that fit their criteria more efficiently. That change is minor, but recent hotel conferences and forums have been awhirl with rumors of hotels experimenting with Google’s channel. When hotels opt for the commission model, they can delay paying the cost of the booking until after a guest has stayed at their property. That’s a more congenial model for many hotels than, say, spending on ad campaigns that may or may not result in bookings. It’s not clear to what extent Google may be cannibalizing its old AdWords and pay-per-click business with its new product, or if it is stealing sharing from online travel agencies and metasearch brands that are among its biggest advertisers. But the company does believe its commission-based, direct booking approach will be increasingly popular with hoteliers and consumers. For context, consider what analyst Robert Cole says in his recent report for Tnooz on hotel rate parity and the fate of third-party distribution: “Hoteliers will rarely admit that they love to pay commissions. Commissions eliminate the risk of committing marketing funds to programs that may not be successful. “With the fragmentation of hotel ownership, management and distribution, equitably budgeting expenses across multiple parties operating under different business models can be a challenge. “Even the most successful marketing campaigns exhibiting stratospheric Return on Ad Spend (ROAS, or gross revenue generated per dollar spent on advertising) may have difficulty securing incremental funding commissions, but, are nevertheless easy, as they are only paid on consumed business. “The only risk is that the travel sellers may not produce sufficient volume, but that remains a better alternative to expending marketing funds, only to fall short as well.” Case studies A few of the Google Hotel Ads Integration Partners worldwide – namely, Mirai, Seekda and WIHP – agreed to come forward with case studies for a press/marketing push by the search giant. Seekda says that one of its clients, Superbude Hostel and Hotel in Hamburg, Germany, is seeing an average of 13% conversion rate with the ads. Digital agency WIHP says that its client Hotel Atmospheres, a boutique hotel in Paris, France, “is seeing an average return-on-ad-spend of 4,700%.” Mirai says that its client Hotel Àmbit Barcelona finds that Google Hotel Ads “contribute up to 10% of the hotel’s overall website sales. One final reason for hoteliers to find Google’s product appealing is that it drives more direct bookings – thus dodging the middlemen like online travel agencies. The ad product gives a hotel a chance to re-market to guests for repeat business. The hotels capture personal information directly – unlike what typically happens with bookings via third-party channels.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

No sifting through an app store to find it and no download required. Applications are streamed by clicking a link on a mobile website, in a text or e-mail message or through social media. The ability to access them without downloading is gaining the attention of companies like San Francisco-based Glu because, let’s face it, it takes time and effort to search for and install apps. Almost half of smartphone users don’t download a single app in any given month, and the average user downloads two, according to researcher ComScore Inc. One of the problems is there are just too many apps, even within games, and that’s made it harder for people to find ones that interest them, said Richard Au, a senior technical director of a Glu studio. Streaming “presents the experience of your app without all the barriers; that really helps with discovery and brand awareness,” Au said. The ability to tap into apps through social media also boosts engagement, he said. Friends or Twitter celebrities might invite users to join them in games by clicking on a link. Streaming could threaten the livelihood of app stores run by Apple Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc., both of which offer more than 2 million applications and take a cut of as much as 30 per cent of an app’s price. That’s a lot of money: Total app store revenue worldwide, excluding in-app ads, should reach US$102 billion (RM446.74 billion) in 2020, up from US$52 billion this year, according to researcher App Annie. And while fewer than 100 are enabled for streaming today, the number will climb to about 100,000 in five years, said Raul Castanon-Martinez, an analyst at 451 Research. He called that a conservative estimate. “App streaming is certainly a very viable and very threatening future way of interacting with mobile content, mobile games and mobile apps,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at researcher Recon Analytics. “It could very significantly impact app stores, especially if you have a blockbuster app. It’s a huge revenue impact.” Take the summer phenom augmented-reality game Pokemon GO, for example. It drew almost 55 million users in July, according to ComScore. Sega, the Japanese publisher of Sonic the Hedgehog games, and Glu are using technology from startup 1APP to stream their apps on iPhones or Android devices. Menlo Park, California-based 1APP, which launched this month, takes an undisclosed share of revenue, though Chief Executive Officer Raheel Hasan says it’s less than what the app stores get. He said the company has a second business model in which it charges per use. Other developers are adopting Google’s streaming technologies, including Instant Apps, which rolled out in May and lets users access parts of an app. Facebook Messenger began letting developers embed app-like capabilities, bypassing app stores so that users can, for example, summon and pay for rides with Uber. Connectivity Issue One big drawback: app streaming only works where connectivity is available. That could be problematic in rural areas, emerging countries and even at crowded places like football stadiums where lots of people try to get online with mobile devices at the same time. “The cons of it is, you need a constant network connection,” said Mike Facemire, an analyst at Forrester Research. “The offline network capabilities are obviated. There’s a difference between having a connection, and having a good connection.” On the plus side, streaming has shown to increase app usage. Startup Chimani, which has 64 apps that act as guides to national parks, was one of the first developers to try Google’s streaming last year. The functionality increased the number of user sessions — essentially, the number of times users accessed the app — by 23 per cent from a year ago, according to the Portland, Maine-based company. Satisfying sponsors “They are virtually interacting with our apps and not doing a download,” Chimani CEO Kerry Gallivan said in an interview. That’s a big deal because the company, whose apps are free, makes money off sponsorships from companies like Subaru Co. “By having increased user sessions, that translates into increased impressions, which is one of the measures we use.” Google’s technology only works on Android devices, and that’s a problem, Gallivan said. Older Android phones working on more dated versions of the Google operating system may not be able to use the streaming feature. With Apple the top smartphone maker in the US with about  43 per cent market share in September, according to ComScore, Chimani wants to target Apple devices as well. 1APP works with all operating systems and devices, which has helped it snag more than 1 million users since it began trials last year. It streams the apps from remote servers. As wireless networks get speedier and more widely available, streaming will become more reliable and the connectivity risks will likely diminish. “It is just not practical for users to keep downloading apps endlessly,” said Castanon-Martinez, the 451 Research analyst. — The Hollywood Reporter/Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Three Star Wars drones to land before Christmas (VIDEO) Facebook's Zuckerberg urges post-Trump world not to 'disconnect' Tech throwback: Weird things we used to do with MSN Messenger Zuckerberg says he’ll take steps to solve Facebook fake news France trains eagles to down drones Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls So, is it worth asking Santa for an iPhone 7 (or 7 Plus)?

The Korea Herald > Business > Industry Decision on Google’s map request due Friday Company’s stance remains unchanged, but Trump’s election win may sway decision   Published : 2016-11-17 17:22 Updated : 2016-11-17 17:22 The Korean government is set to decide Friday whether it will allow Google to put a detailed map of the country on the company’s global servers. The decision, delayed by the government from an initial August deadline, comes aid trade uncertainties following Donald Trump’s election as the next US president.  It will be the first time a joint government committee provides a decision on whether detailed cartographic information supplied by the government can be exported by the foreign firm. Ahead of the decision Friday, there were reports that the decision committee -- led by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and including other agencies such as the foreign affairs, unification, defense, administration, and trade ministries -- was softening its stance out of fear that President-elect Trump could use a negative decision as leverage against Korea in trade relations. However, individual lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have publicly stated their opposition to the possibility.  Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the ruling Saenuri Party made strong objections against providing Google with sensitive data without a properly enforceable “privacy shield.”  The third-largest People’s Party signed a joint statement urging against giving Google “preferential treatment” after it “provided false information” by stating that all other countries had allowed their maps to be exported, with no mention of specific security exceptions for countries like China and Israel. Lawmakers Choi Kyung-hwan (left) and Shin Yong-hyun of the People's Party speak to press Thursday, opposing permitting Google take Korea's maps abroad. (Yonhap) The search engine asked the Korean government for the map information in June in order to provide full access to its Google Maps services here.  However, the government was wary of Google’s request to store the map on its servers overseas due to concerns about the exposure of security facilities when the detailed 1:5000-ratio map is used in conjunction with Google’s satellite service Google Earth.  The fact that Google does not have a server here, exempting it from local taxes, also turned public opinion against the company, as well as worries about the competition Google would raise against Korean mapping services. Currently, the leading map service providers are Korean companies such as SK Telecom, Naver, and Kakao. Since the initial August deadline for the decision, Google has continued to refuse to accept the Korean government’s conditions for blurring out information about sensitive facilities. But the election of  Trump, who had vowed to pursue protectionist trade policies during his presidential campaign, has raised new questions about the impact of the Korean government’s decision on bilateral trade relations. Even before the election, the US Trade Representative had taken note of the conflict in its 2016 National Trade Estimate Report, saying that while the US was “sensitive” to national security issues in Korea and that it would “continue to consult with Korea on opening (the mapping) market to participation by foreign suppliers.“  Representatives from the US Trade Representative had also met with authorities here to discuss the issue in a closed-door meeting.  The final decision is expected to be reached by the government committee in a meeting Friday morning.   By Won Ho-jung (hjwon@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

The Group, formed in March this year, is responsible for sharing a clear direction of the popular Web services framework with other companies. Microsoft had formed the .NET Foundation in 2014 as an overseer of the open-sourcing of the software framework; members of the Technical Steering Group, apart from Microsoft and Google, include Samsung, Red Hat, JetBrains, and Unity. Google has been an active .NET contributor and offers .NET libraries for over 200 of its services. The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides first-class support to .NET on the internet search giant’s infrastructure; Microsoft products Visual Studio and PowerShell in August 2016 received GCP support as well. In a blog post, Google said, “Joining the Technical Steering Group for the .NET Foundation expands our participation. We’re excited to work with the industry to contribute to .NET as an excellent open platform for developers in the enterprise. Don’t hesitate to contact us if we can help you bring your .NET workloads to GCP!”Samsung made an announcement of its own regarding the .NET framework this week. The South Korean titan announced the preview release of .NET Core support for the Tizen OS as well as Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. With these, developers working on the Tizen platform – an operating system jointly developed by Samsung, Intel and The Linux Foundation – will now have the option to create applications using the .NET framework; HTML5 and C were the only supported languages till now. Reference: The first .NET preview for Tizen provides developers with device emulators and Visual Studio access with complete IntelliSense and debugging capabilities, according to a VentureBeat report. However, these will only allow developers to create apps for mobile devices; reportedly, only a preview is available currently, and full availability can be expected around March 2017. The company will provide .NET app development support for Internet of Things devices, wearables and smart TVs in future releases. “Samsung is excited to be a part of the .NET community. .NET has an extensive developer base and great potential,” said Samsung’s Executive Vice President and Deputy Head of Software R&D Center Seung-hwan Cho. “Through thoughtful and progressive collaboration with Microsoft, Samsung is expecting to create unique development experiences for both Tizen and C# developers, enriching the Tizen ecosystem.” Tags: Microsoft, Google, .Net Foundation, DotNet, Tizen Twitter Introduces Snapchat-Like QR Codes to Help Users Find Accounts With Ease Donald Trump's Top Aide Steve Bannon Suggests There Are Too Many Asian Bosses in Silicon Valley Google Joins .NET Foundation Technical Steering Group; Samsung's Tizen Gets .NET Support     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Huawei Mate 9 Lite Vivo Xplay6 Vivo X9 Plus Vivo X9 Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Motorola Moto M Lyf F8 Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) General Mobile GM5 Xiaomi Redmi 4A Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Xiaomi Redmi 4 Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » Google Play Gift Card In Digital Entertainment Buy Now Rs. 1,500 Hungama Music Card In Digital Entertainment Buy Now Rs. 269 Yu Yureka Plus In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 12,500Rs. 6,389 Panasonic Eluga Turbo In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 13,999Rs. 7,999 OPINIONSALL AUTHORS Gopal Sathe UPI Could Help With the Cash Crunch - So Why Is No One Using It?

Google Translate is a useful translation service that is built-in to Google Chrome but also available as a web service and as mobile apps. This first step into the future of Google Translate enables the functionality for the mobile apps and Web service. What's not yet include are web site translations but that is to follow eventually as well. Neural Machine Translation has been enabled for the following languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. These languages cover 35% of all Google Translate queries according to Google. Today we’re putting Neural Machine Translation into action with a total of eight language pairs to and from English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. These represent the native languages of around one-third of the world's population, covering more than 35% of all Google Translate queries! We talked about the switch to neural networks before in regards to Google Translate, and suggest you check out the initial article that provides details on how neural networks differ from traditional computer powered translations. Only this much: One of the core differences is that neural machine translation looks at the sentence as a whole instead of just individual words or phrases. This improves the translation significantly according to Google as context is better understood which in turn produces better translated sentences. At a high level, the Neural system translates whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar. Since it’s easier to understand each sentence, translated paragraphs and articles are a lot smoother and easier to read. And this is all possible because of end-to-end learning system built on Neural Machine Translation, which basically means that the system learns over time to create better, more natural translations. While your mileage may vary, neural network translation improves the quality of the translated text significantly when compared to Google Translate's previously used translation algorithm. Companies with access to Google's Cloud Translation API may use the new translation system as of today as well. Closing Words Google Translate was always one of the better translation services on the Internet. While far from perfect, it usually produced better or at least similar results than comparable services. The switch to Neural Machine Translations will improve translations significantly. While limited to eight languages currently only, the new system will be available for all 103 languages that Google Translate supports eventually. Now You: What's your take on the quality of the "new" translation algorithm? Summary Article Name Google Translate switches to Neural Machine Translations Description Google announced yesterday that it has switched the engine that powers its Google Translate service to Neural Machine Translations for eight language pairs, promising that more will follow over time.

Ive got a little problem with the site although (not related with this post). I can't see any comments on mobile (clean browser, no Adblock etc.) Is it something wrong on my side? Does anyone else experiencing similar issue either? Reply Martin Brinkmann November 17, 2016 at 9:32 am # Hi Duri, we are testing a new theme currently and it does not include comments right now. We are aware of the issue though and are exploring various options to change that. Sorry for the inconvenience. Reply XenoSilvano November 17, 2016 at 6:08 pm # I use Google Translate to translate a substantial amount of text from time to time which spares me a lot of time and work of having to do so myself manually, I have to proof read the translated text for correctness once the text has been translated in bulk which is where the translation work begins on my end, the implementation of this neural machine system will allow for more accurate translations to be made, obviating the need for me to make further corrections I tested Google Translate just now, I can confirm that many of the common prior errors that I would be output in translations are no longer being made Reply Maelish November 17, 2016 at 6:09 pm # Hoping it improves radically. It's Japanese English has been horrible. Japanese has three different alphabets, so it can be a pain to figure things out. Especially since they mix all three into sentences.

Google Engineer Says Antivirus Apps Are Ineffective Magic, Don’t Genuinely Help GO Google security expert says antivirus solutions are useless Nov 17, 2016 07:36 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  There still are many people out there who think that antivirus solutions are must-haves for any computer user, but Google senior security engineer Darren Bilby is certainly not one of them. Speaking at Kiwicon hacking conference, Bilby, who is Manager of the Platform Integrity team as part of the Enterprise Infrastructure Protection Group, said it loud and clear: antivirus apps are simply ineffective and the security world should concentrate its efforts on things that can make a difference. “Please no more magic,” he was quoted as saying by The Reg. “We need to stop investing in those things we have shown do not work,” he continued, adding that antivirus solutions are nothing more than ineffective magic that most admins install just because they have to, not because they’re efficient. “Antivirus does some useful things, but in reality it is more like a canary in the coal mine. It is worse than that. It's like we are standing around the dead canary saying ‘Thank god it inhaled all the poisonous gas’.” Focusing on things that matter The Google engineer eventually calls for security experts and hackers to concentrate on things that are more important, such as intrusion detection systems that can make a difference and protect users even if they access malicious websites or open compromised documents. “And sure you are going to have to spend some time on things like intrusion detection systems because that's what the industry has decided is the plan, but allocate some time to working on things that actually genuinely help.” Bilby also explains that most companies blame users for getting their PCs compromised because they click on links and files that are infected, but in reality, the security of these systems is not good enough to protect them, and this is what security engineers should focus on in the future. While opinions on the efficiency of antivirus solutions are still mixed, these statements come only a few days after Russian-based security company Kaspersky started a war against Microsoft for trying to convince users to give up on third-party security software and switch to its own Windows Defender. Kaspersky has already received the support of other security vendors, who also believe that Microsoft is playing dirty in Windows 10 with Windows Defender, calling for European authorities to look into this practice and decide if it affects competition or not. #Google#antivirus#security#Windows subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Antivirus Firms Unite Against Microsoft Push for Windows Defender in Windows 10 Russia Starts Microsoft Antivirus Investigation After Kaspersky Complaint Kaspersky Accuses Microsoft of Playing Dirty with Antivirus Apps in Windows 10 - Updated Microsoft Extends Support for Windows Security Tool Despite Its “Serious Limits” Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked Kapustkiy Breaks into Indian Regional Council Server, 17,000 Users Exposed Microsoft Launches Windows Defender Hub for Windows 10 Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked    The Google engineer says security experts should focus on other protection systems New Apps PC Win Booster: A simple to use application that helps you maintain system stability by performing rigorous registry and system scans while also resolving any found issues BlackFog Privacy: Keep track of your network traffic in real-time so you can detect potential security leaks and data collection activities using this app Soft4Boost Video to Device: Convert DVD content and multiple types of video files to formats suitable for various devices, with this wizard-like application AtHome Camera: View the video stream from one or several web cameras and even recording the feed to a local video, thus monitoring your home at all times App Builder: Visually design HTML5 apps in a variety of sizes, without prior knowledge of programming techniques, thanks to this straightforward tool Soft4Boost TV Recorder: This simple and intuitive piece of software provides you with the ability to record television programs on your computer by means of a TV tuner Soft4Boost Video to Flash: Convert videos to Flash format and generate the corresponding HTML code that helps you insert the SWF video on your webpage with the help of this simple app Reader comments US President-Elect Donald Trump Can’t End Russia’s War Against American Software more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The much-maligned Google Glass project was scrapped after becoming the subject of online mockery for its awkward product design and high price tag. According to Bloomberg, however, we may see Apple-branded smart glasses as part of Apple’s new wearables push, following on the success of the Apple Watch. It’s important to note that these are still rumors, but Apple may have already approached potential suppliers to acquire small quantities of near-eye displays for internal testing. Speaking with unidentified sources within Apple, Bloomberg claims that the contemplated Apple smart glasses would connect wirelessly to iPhones, and would display images and other information in the wearer’s field of view, and might even employ a version of augmented reality. The augmented reality angle lends a little more credence to these rumors than they might otherwise warrant. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been an outspoken proponent of AR in the past, mentioning on a conference call earlier this year that the company has invested a lot of time and money in AR and plans to continue to invest in the nascent technology. More: The next Apple Watch could have biometric authentication and gesture controls If anyone could pull this off, it would be Apple. The firm has a long history of building on existing technology by simply improving on design, and in fact some of its greatest success stories have been innovative takes on existing — and popular — technologies. The iPod, iPhone, and Apple Watch all built on existing technology by seeking to improve the design and user experience. While the Apple Watch may still be in the early stages in terms of market acceptance, the iPod and iPhone have had an immense impact on their respective market spaces, transforming them entirely. So while it’s likely a long way off, and may never happen, Apple-branded smart glasses could be just the kick that augmented reality needs to get off the ground as a ubiquitous, everyday piece of technology.

Here's everything you need to know about buying VR gear (and apps) for someone else -- and spending surprisingly little in the process. How to give the gift of VR 0 Gadgets by Rick Broida November 16, 2016 12:30 PM PST @cheapskateblog Up Next Trump presidency fuels heated encryption debate What do you get for the person who has everything? How about an entirely different reality -- like, say, the virtual kind? Don't worry, I'm not about to suggest you spend $600 for an Oculus Rift, $700 for a PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR or $800 for an HTC Vive -- excellent gifts though they would be. Those PC- and console-powered rigs are fantastic, but you can give the gift of VR for a lot less. All the recipient needs is a smartphone and a compatible VR headset -- namely something in the Google Cardboard family or a Samsung Gear VR. So we're here to discuss: what kind to get, what extras you might want to include and how to gift a few VR apps to get someone started. The quick backstory: As Google proved with the release of its Cardboard platform back in 2014, a smartphone can deliver a surprisingly good virtual-reality experience. That's because smartphones have big screens, fast processors and built-in accelerometers that can detect motion. Slip a phone into a headset equipped with special lenses, fire up any app that can mirror its images side-by-side and presto: You've got VR. So, if you want to give someone the gift VR, it starts with the headset -- one that works with the phone he or she already owns. Pick a headset, any headset Although "Google Cardboard" is the term most frequently associated with smartphone-powered VR, you don't need to buy a Google-branded product -- nor must you settle for cheap, cardboard construction. There are dozens upon dozens of universally compatible VR headsets that make use of the Google Cardboard concept, but with much nicer designs. Head to Amazon, for example, and search for "VR headset." You'll see tons of results, many of them priced between $15 and 30. (Suddenly this gift option is sounding mighty good, no?) And they're all compatible with Android phones and iPhones alike. My key recommendation is to choose a model that's either large enough to accommodate eyeglasses or adjustable in both focal length and width. Otherwise, unless the recipient has 20/20 vision, blurry VR awaits. One good bet is this Rokjam headset, which sells for $29.99 and includes a four-way lens adjustment for each eye. Not to confuse matters, Google's new Daydream View headset may sound like a good option ("It must be like Cardboard, only better!"), but for the moment it's compatible with only one phone: Google's own Pixel. What's more, it's limited to Google's currently small ecosystem of compatible apps, whereas any of the aforementioned headsets will work with the thousands of VR apps available via Google Play. Bottom line: Give the gift of a generic, inexpensive headset -- unless the recipient is a Samsung Galaxy owner... The best VR headset for Samsung Galaxy owners All modern smartphones can do VR, but if your friend or family member owns a Samsung Galaxy (specifically, one of these models), you should definitely go with the Samsung Gear VR. The recently released 2016 edition, which adds the Galaxy S7 to its roster of compatible models, sells for $99.99. But you can pick up last year's Gear VR for as little as $60 -- sometimes even less on daily-deal sites. What makes the Gear VR better than one of the aforementioned generic headsets (any of which, incidentally, would work just fine with a Galaxy phone)? Simple: Samsung delivers an Oculus-powered ecosystem of apps and games, many of which are vastly superior to what you can find in the Google Play store. Indeed, that ecosystem includes some of the same titles available for the Oculus Rift. The Gear VR itself can't deliver a Rift-caliber experience, but it gets pretty close at times. Trust me when I say the Gear VR delivers an order of magnitude above generic smartphone VR -- so it's worth a bit more money. Not sure you can trust me? Check out Scott Stein's review. Get an accessory to go with the headset An inexpensive Bluetooth controller can be a handy extra for the VR headset user.Photo by Jozabova If you're buying someone a headset, do your friend a solid and get a gamepad controller to go with it. Though not always necessary, it can come in handy for navigating menus -- and some games benefit greatly from (or even outright require) physical buttons to mash. Some headsets already come with a controller, like the Rokjam pictured above. But there's one consideration: compatibility. Although the headsets themselves all work with Android phones and iPhones, some controllers may not. (The Rokjam's, for example, is Android-only.) Fortunately, you can choose just about any Bluetooth gamepad and it should work just fine with any VR headset -- again, provided the gamepad itself is compatible with the phone in question. It doesn't have to be fancy, either, because in most games and apps, all you really need is a single select/fire button. Something simple like this $8 model would probably do the trick. How to add VR apps to your gift Finally, if you want to complete the package, consider giving some VR love in the form of apps or games. Best bet: a gift card to either iTunes or the Google Play store. Unfortunately, Oculus doesn't currently offer gift cards, so you can't do likewise for Gear VR recipients. If you're shopping for someone who already owns an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, gift options are available in the form of Steam gift cards. Likewise, you can find Playstation Store gift cards pretty much anywhere.

By Agamoni Ghosh November 17, 2016 06:45 GMT Sundar Pichai is set to meet the EU antitrust commissioner to discuss the spate of charges levelled against Google Reuters Google CEO Sundar Pichai is set to meet the European Union's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager to discuss a series of charges levelled against his company. Through last month the technology giant had rejected all charges against it including that of using its monopoly in the market against rivals. The meeting between the two is set to be the first since February after which Vestager had announced the investigation against Google in April. EU's investigation had concluded that Google had denied consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stood in the way of innovation by other players, which is a breach of EU antitrust rules. Responding to the allegations specifically made against Android, Google's mobile OS, the company's senior vice president and general counsel Kent Walker had argued some days ago that the Android operating system helps competition rather than crush its rivals. "Any phone maker can download Android and modify it in any way they choose. But that flexibility makes Android vulnerable to fragmentation, a problem that plagued previous operating systems like Unix and Symbian," said Walker in a blog post. "When anyone can modify your code, how do you ensure there's a common, consistent version of the operating system, so that developers don't have to go through the hassle and expense of building multiple versions of their apps? To manage this challenge, we work with hardware makers to establish a minimum level of compatibility among Android devices." The company has also refuted allegations that it abused its dominance to promote its shopping service and a niche advertising product. These antitrust charges have been lingering on against Google for the last six years since rivals like Microsoft first complained about the company's practices. Following lengthy investigations and the upcoming dialogue between Pichai and Vestager EU regulators are expected to rule next year on whether Google is guilty of misconduct as alleged. If found guilty Google may be forced to change its existing business practices in the EU region and pay a hefty fine for each of the charges levelled against it, say experts.

Well, Google may soon come to your aide in India. The search giant is said to launch a new feature dubbed 'Toilet Locator' which will be introduced in collaboration with the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD). According to a new report, Google will start a pilot run of the new feature in the National Capital Region starting "some time from November 16 to November 30." The feature will be integrated in to Google Maps and will let anyone search for a nearby toilet, just as one searches for any other place on the Maps app. The feature is reportedly being piloted under Government of India's Swachhata Pakhwada, or Cleanliness Fortnight campaign. A MoUD official claimed that the ministry "is already in the process of rolling out this facility in the NCR region" and it will include public restrooms that are located in metro stations, malls, petrol pumps, and hospitals. Another official who asked not to be named suggested that the process to list the available toilets in the NCR region was "almost over." One of the official explaining the process told IBTimes India, "People will first need to open Google Maps, and then search for toilets near them. They can search for a variety of keywords, like toilet, lavatory, swach, swachhata, shulabh or shauchalay, and Google will point them to the nearest toilets." According to the report, the Toilet Locator will be depending on "heavily on crowdsourcing" and will see feedback from people. This means that people will be able to rate the cleanliness of the toilet they last searched via Google Maps, or even leave a review, just as they would for any other public establishment on Google Maps.Unfortunately, there is no word when the 'Toilet Locator' will be available to users across India. Though, the MoUD official stressed that "Mechanisms are in place for the facility to be scaled up, and for it to reach all the 2,041 urban local bodies (ULBs) of the country." Notably, this is not the first such attempt to offer help to people via an app. Earlier this year, Delhi saw the launch of Find x Toilet app that helped locate a toilet nearest to one's current location.

Windows MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Specific to 64-bit Plugin sandbox, allows 64-bit NPAPI sandbox level to drop below 2. Windows Platform Specifics Windows Source Code Overview The core of the Windows sandbox is Google's chromium sandbox. Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library (bug 925471): For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Bug Lists Milestones Windows Content Process sbwc1 Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release.

But privilege escalation via kernel vulnerabilities is relatively common, so we also use the seccomp-bpf system call filter to reduce the attack surface that a compromised content process can directly access.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Microsoft FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Microsoft, Google, and Samsung Bury the Hatchet with New Partnerships GO All three announced agreements at Connect(); conference Nov 17, 2016 06:32 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft’s Connect(); developer event kicked off yesterday with some pretty big announcements, and the Redmond-based software giant itself started the celebration by revealing that it was joining The Linux Foundation as a Platinum member in a move that clearly shows the firm’s ambitions in the open-source world. But Microsoft’s announcement was followed by similar news from Google and Samsung, which also attended the developer conference to share their efforts with the community. Google, in particular, is joining the independent .NET Foundation, becoming an important Microsoft partner for the open platform, despite remaining a key rival in so many markets. “Wednesday’s addition of Google to the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google’s commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET,” Microsoft announced in a press release. Samsung’s announcement And Samsung, in its turn, is also making significant steps in this regard with a preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, the company’s in-house operating system that’s growing at a fast pace. Tizen is currently installed on a variety of devices, including smartwatches, and there are rumors claiming that the South Korean firm is planning to bring it on smartphones as well in the coming years. “Other industry leaders are also betting on .NET Core for their own commercial products. On Wednesday Samsung is releasing a preview of its Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. Developers can use the tools to build .NET apps for the Tizen operating system that runs on millions of Samsung TVs, wearables, mobile devices and many IoT devices around the world,” Microsoft proudly announced. Without a doubt, having large companies such as Google and Samsung on its side can only be good news for Microsoft, especially because the software giant is expanding so aggressively in the open source world. It goes without saying that seeing Microsoft joining The Linux Foundation is surprising news given the fact that the company’s leaders once described Linux as “a cancer,” but with Satya Nadella at the helm of the firm, getting closer to the open source simply makes sense. #Microsoft#Google#Samsung#Linux#open source subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Joins the Linux Foundation As Everyone Now Loves Open Source CCleaner 5.24 for Windows Now Available for Download Microsoft Releases Windows 7 and 8.1 Preview Update Rollups for December Microsoft Working with EU over LinkedIn Deal, Says Facebook Competition Is Key Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked Kapustkiy Breaks into Indian Regional Council Server, 17,000 Users Exposed Microsoft Launches Windows Defender Hub for Windows 10 Michigan State University Hacked, Personal Info, Social Security Numbers Stolen New York Wants Donald Trump to Introduce Laws Forcing Apple to Hack iPhones Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked    Microsoft, Google, and Samsung working for an open goal New Apps PC Win Booster: A simple to use application that helps you maintain system stability by performing rigorous registry and system scans while also resolving any found issues BlackFog Privacy: Keep track of your network traffic in real-time so you can detect potential security leaks and data collection activities using this app Soft4Boost Video to Device: Convert DVD content and multiple types of video files to formats suitable for various devices, with this wizard-like application AtHome Camera: View the video stream from one or several web cameras and even recording the feed to a local video, thus monitoring your home at all times App Builder: Visually design HTML5 apps in a variety of sizes, without prior knowledge of programming techniques, thanks to this straightforward tool Soft4Boost TV Recorder: This simple and intuitive piece of software provides you with the ability to record television programs on your computer by means of a TV tuner Soft4Boost Video to Flash: Convert videos to Flash format and generate the corresponding HTML code that helps you insert the SWF video on your webpage with the help of this simple app Reader comments Microsoft Joins the Linux Foundation As Everyone Now Loves Open Source more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Google Earth VR allows users to travel anywhere across the world, from the comfort of their homes. Exploring the Earth is a God like experience, you can fly across the planet like a bird over coastlines or cities, drop to the surface and explore through streets of, or trek across the Himalayas, with the mountains at your feet, as a giant tens of thousands of feet tall. There are cinematic tours, as well as hand picked destinations. The hand picked destinations include the Amazon River, the Grand Canyon, the Swiss Alps, and Manhattan. There is a minimum requirement of 8 GB of RAM to run the application, and it is only available on Windows. Google Earth VR has been received well, with over 98 percent of the 200 plus reviews being positive. The experience is available for free. StreetView is not integrated into the app though. There is no search for places, and you cannot enter co-ordinates after searching for a location in another app. The experience requires a constant internet connection, and the details in a view takes time to load, just like the regular Google Earth. The App is the second VR app to release first for the Vive after Tilt Brush. Google Earth VR is expected to land on other platforms next year.

And with price tags comparable to premium models from Apple and Samsung, we couldn’t wait to get our hands on them to see whether they’re really worth their salt. Google claims its new handsets have the best rear cameras ever seen on a smartphone. And as we put all mobile phones through the same photography tests, we’ve been able to put this claim to task. They’re also the first phones that come with Google Assistant built-in - that's a voice-controlled 'virtual assistant' comparable to Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's Siri. Google has made major claims about how powerful Assistant is, with it supposedly able to deliver a conversational experience that lets you can build on previous questions to get extra detail. Also in our latest round of tests were two more affordable phones from Motorola and one from Samsung, all of which are available for less than £200. Scroll down the page to find the links to all our latest individual reviews. All phones go through the same tests, regardless of price – so you can trust our results to really separate the wheat from the chaff. And as we’ve found there's often no direct link between price and quality, it’s worth reading our reviews before parting with your cash. We’ve tested more than 100 phones to help you get the most for your money - head to our smartphone reviews to make the best choice for you. Best Buy mobile phones Best Buys will be a pleasure to use, not a pain We all spend a lot of time with our smartphones, and we know you’ll want to enjoy owning and using yours – rather than regretting not doing your homework before buying. Fortunately, we’ve shortlisted the phones that stand out from the crowd. You can trust a Best Buy mobile to have a great display, take good photos, and respond quickly to your touch. Don’t Buys, meanwhile, have dismal screens, take blurry, low-quality snaps, and you’ll be jabbing at the screen in frustration when apps don’t open quickly. To avoid ending up with a dud, check out our mobile phone Best Buys. Best mobile phones for battery life The last thing you’ll want is a phone that’ll run out of power after minimal use. Don't buy a phone that'll struggle to get through the day We’ve found vast differences between the best and worst phones when it comes to battery life. For instance, the best phone we’ve ever tested gives nearly 25 hours of call time or over 11 hours of web browsing – which is fantastic. The worst phone we’ve ever tested, on the other hand, offers a dismal 6.8 hours of talk time or around five hours of web browsing. Buying a mobile phone with a four- or five-star rating for battery life means you’ll have a phone that’ll easily see you through the day.

So, it was only natural that its services would one day be available on virtual reality platforms – and that’s now. Google announced on Wednesday that Google Earth VR is now a thing, starting with HTC Vive. This news is clearly for the dedicated VR fan, considering the Vive retails for $799 (about Rs. 54,000) and needs a powerful PC alongside. Support for other platforms will roll out over the next year. “At 196.9 million square miles, we know the world is pretty big, so we’ve made it easy to find great places to visit,” Google VR product manager Mike Podwal said in an official blog post. “Earth VR comes with cinematic tours and hand-picked destinations that send you to the Amazon River, the Manhattan skyline, the Grand Canyon, the Swiss Alps, and more.” Google also mentioned that Earth has been around for 10 years now, and has seen 2 billion downloads in that time. Earth VR would have been perfect for the recently launched Daydream View, which is lacking in content. It currently supports Google Street View and Google Arts & Culture. That’s all there is to it. You can get Google Earth VR for free on Steam, assuming you’ve access to an HTC Vive. Expect to find some blurred places, considering the kind of requests Google gets now and then.

While the technology is nowhere near being fully autonomous, with more and more automakers and even companies like Google stepping in, self-driving cars have transformed from a mere fantasy to slowly on the way to becoming a mainstream auto technology.   Here are some companies whose self-driving cars might raise competition for Tesla in the near future: Google Google's self-driving car project has been in the works for some time. The company has been testing a fleet of modified Lexus SUVs and new prototype cars. The car uses mapping and sensors to determine location and route. Its sensors let it detect objects around it and classify them on the basis of shape, size and movement. The sensors then choose a safe speed and trajectory for the car. "This prototype design is still on the learning curve from a technology and design standpoint," YooJung Ahn, senior designer, Google self-driving program, reportedly said. But Google has clocked over 2 million self-driving miles by November 2016.  The company is working on a car that will be devoid of pedals or steering wheel and will entirely depend on software to handle the driving. The car recently maneuvered a 180-degree, three-point turn. The company's monthly report for October 2016 states: “Our goal is to develop a fully self-driving car that can handle every part of driving, and that means teaching our car to handle advanced maneuvers like these multi-point turns.” BMW BMW announced in July that it would bring solutions for fully autonomous car — the BMW iNext — by 2021. The company is partnering with Intel and Mobileye on three concept self-driven cars. Details are currently scarce on the subject. "Together with Intel and Mobileye, we aim to develop the technology for autonomous driving within five years. All three partners will pool their know-how in the fields of automotive engineering, technology, computer vision and machine learning,” BMW CEO Harald Krueger said in a speech in July at a quarterly press conference in Munich. The company acquired Nokia HERE maps in August 2015 along with Audi. In December, HERE 360 Editor-in-Chief Pino Bonetti said that the company would work on high-resolution real-time maps for self-driving cars.  Toyota Toyota has taken a different approach to self-driving. Instead of a technology that takes over driving, the company is working on a technology that assists the driver. The company intends to introduce this technology by 2020.   The company was a late mover to autonomous driving, but it has accelerated its project by investing $1 billion for a new Toyota Research Institute and is working with MIT, Stanford and the University of Michigan on autonomous driving. The company's “guardian angel” system will automatically take control of a vehicle in case of danger.  “In the same way that anti-lock braking and emergency braking work, there is a virtual driver that is trying to make sure you don’t have an accident by temporarily taking control from you,” Gill Pratt, CEO of the Toyota Research Institute, explained. General Motors Related Stories Tesla Says It Will Roll Out Uber-Style Services Google's self drive car to hit Nevada if legislation gets through General Motors has acquired Cruise Automation and its Chevrolet Bolt EV is being modified into a self-driving version. A 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV was spotted in San Francisco with a “Platypus” label in August. Previously, the company was working on “cruise automation” technology — retrofit kits that will make any car autonomous — but it is now gearing toward fully autonomous vehicle technology. GM is only testing the technology on its Chevrolet Bolt EV.  Other details about the project haven't been revealed yet.

The move by the two tech giants aims to choke off funds to an industry fuelled by bogus, often sensational “news” circulating online and seen as a potential influence on public opinion. A Google statement to AFP said new policies “will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies.” The shift will mean Google restricts ads “on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” the statement said. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the company receives billions of queries daily and admitted errors had been made. “There have been a couple of incidences where it has been pointed out and we didn’t get it right. “And so it is a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it,” he said in a BBC interview. Pichai said there should be “no situation where fake news gets distributed” and committed to making improvements. “I don’t think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely,” he said. — AFP On Monday, internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Republican Donald Trump had won the popular vote in addition to the electoral college. The numbers on a blog called 70News — contradicting official results tallied so far by states — said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. The blog urged those petitioning for the electoral college to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort. Facebook is implementing a similar policy, a spokesman said. “In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,” a Facebook statement said. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news.” One report said Facebook had developed a tool to weed out fake news but did not deploy it before the US election, fearing a backlash from conservatives after a controversy over its handling of “trending topics.” Facebook denied the report. Some critics have gone so far as to blame Facebook for enabling Trump’s victory, saying it did not do enough to curb bogus news that appeared to help rally his supporters. Stories that went viral in the run-up to the vote included such headlines as “Hillary Clinton Calling for Civil War If Trump Is Elected” and “Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President.” The prevalence of fake news has prompted calls for Facebook to consider itself a “media” company rather than a neutral platform, a move which would require it to make editorial judgments on articles. Facebook executives have repeatedly rejected this idea, but since the election have pledged to work harder to filter out hoaxes and misinformation. In a weekend post, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the notion that fake news helped sway the election, and said that “more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic.” Still, he said that “we don’t want any hoaxes on Facebook” and pledged to do more to curb fake news without censoring content. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” he said. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” Ken Paulson, a former USA Today editor who is dean at the media school of Middle Tennessee State University, said Facebook and other platforms should not be required to filter out news but that it would be good for business. “My hunch is that most of Facebook’s loyal customers would welcome a cleaning up of the town square,” he said.

He will be meeting EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and Guenther Oettinger over the anti-trust case. (Source: AP) The chief executive of Alphabet Inc’s Google and the European Union’s antitrust chief will meet on Friday, following the US technology group’s formal rejection this month of a spate of charges, including blocking rivals in online search advertising. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai will meet in Brussels with EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and Guenther Oettinger, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, as the final stop in a short tour of the continent, spokespeople for Google and the EU confirmed. Last week, Google General Counsel Kent Walker argued that the company’s Android operating system helps competition, rebutting charges that the firm uses the platform to crush rivals. The Mountain View, Calif., company also rejected charges that it unfairly promoted its shopping service and blocked rivals in online search advertising. EU regulators are expected to rule next year on those issues, potentially ordering Google to change its business practices and levying huge fines. The case has hung over Google since the European Commission opened its investigation six years ago, following complaints from Microsoft Corp and other rivals. The Android case poses a keen risk to Google as the operating system has yielded about $22 billion in profit for the company since its release in 2008, an Oracle Corp lawyer told a U.S. court in January. Pichai last met with Vestager and Oettinger in February, shortly after he was named chief executive of Google. During a visit to London earlier this week, Pichai announced an expansion of Google’s presence in the city, saying he was optimistic about Britain’s future as a tech hub, despite the uncertainty caused by the nation’s vote to leave the European Union in June.

Why Social Media Is a Battleground for Prompted Search November 15, 2016 by Gib Olander Leave a Comment Filed Under: Commentary In a world of omnichannel search, a business’s social media spaces are places where consumers can find what brands have to offer at a local level. Consumers are using Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, Twitter, and other social platforms to figure out where to go nearby to shop and play. (Google famously labeled these moments of exploration as micro-moments.) As consumers search across a larger palette of devices and channels such as social, a brand needs to view its social spaces as battlegrounds for prompted search. I introduced the concept of prompted search in an October Street Fight column. As I discussed in the column, prompted search happens when an event triggers a surge in search activity, both branded and nonbranded. Two types of events typically create an occurrence of prompted search: A business engineers an event, such as a product rollout or a sale, which prompts consumers to search for a product, business, or category. An external event over which a business has less (or no) control, such as a major sporting event, creates a spike in search activity. Savvy brands have gotten pretty good at relying on paid and organic search to capitalize on prompted search. Google published a report that discussed how Red Roof Inn has generated more bookings by capitalizing on an unplanned event that occurs all too often: flight cancellations that strand travelers overnight at airports. Red Roof Inn monitored flight patterns at airports close to Red Roof Inn locations (and there are many of them). When extended flight delays happened, Red Roof Inn ran paid search ads promoting its convenient locations, capitalizing on the surge in searches for “lodging nearby” prompted by a flight delay that strands travelers at airports. In an omnichannel world, search engines aren’t the only places where people conduct branded and non-branded searches prompted by events. Social media spaces are also critical, as the popularity of the Pokémon GO augmented reality game demonstrated. For businesses that operate brick-and-mortar locations, Pokémon GO is an excellent example of an external event creating a surge in prompted search. When Pokémon GO exploded in popularity this summer, many businesses suddenly found themselves the object of intense search activity because the game prompted Pokémon GO trainers to look for nearby locations, inside or near businesses, to unlock achievements and to battle other Pokémon GO trainers. Smart brands capitalized on these searches by relying on their Facebook pages and Twitter accounts to promote their locations as ideal places to play Pokémon GO. Businesses also used other social sites such as Yelp to generate foot traffic with Pokémon GO trainers. Many restaurants and bars used Facebook to advertise drink and dining specials for Pokémon GO trainers. Facebook was especially important because the platform capitalized (and still does) on the social nature of Pokémon GO. For a number of reasons, social media is an especially effective touchpoint for businesses to create foot traffic and commerce by capitalizing on prompted search. On social media, brands can react much faster when external events happen, as we’ve seen businesses do time and again through their creation of content that ties into major sporting events. If you live in Chicago, you know what I’m talking about. When the Cubs won Game 7 of the World Series in Cleveland November 2, Chicago businesses turned to social media to congratulate the team and to generate commerce. Social media was the perfect place to do so. Game 7 did not end until late in the evening Chicago time. It didn’t take long for local businesses ranging from Murphy’s Bleachers Bar to the Morton Arboretum to congratulate the Cubs on Twitter. Within hours, Chicago businesses relied on social to generate foot traffic. For example, the Museum of Science and Industry’s Facebook page offered a $7 off admission all weekend for anyone wearing Cubs gear, in a nod to the fact that it took the Cubs seven games to win the World Series. On Twitter, the Cubby Bear, a popular bar located across the street from Wrigley Field, let their followers know that they were open at 9:00 a.m. November 4 for the Cubs victory parade. Meanwhile, Taco Bell demonstrated how to drive foot traffic while the World Series was in progress. During the World Series, Taco Bell launched a “Steal a Base, Steal a Taco” promotion, the fifth time it has done so. If a player stole a base during the World Series, participating Taco Bell locations would hand out free Doritos Locos Tacos on a designated date depending on which game the stolen base occurred. After Cleveland Indians shortstop Francisco Lindor stole a base in Game 1, Taco Bell gave away free tacos on November 2. But the promotion wasn’t perfect from a prompted search standpoint: to close the loop with people who were conducting “free tacos near me” searches after Lindor stole a base in Game 1, Taco Bell could have done a better job identifying the names of participating locations and clarifying the date that the tacos were to be given away. Social media would have been the perfect place to do so. Brands can also capitalize on social to support events under their own control. During the holiday shopping season, retailers are getting more sophisticated with their use of social to capitalize on searches for things to do and buy. For instance, Target usually coordinates multiple channels ranging from Instagram to Snaphat to ensure that its name appears when consumers do near-me searches for holiday deals. And Target is not being opportunistic. Target plans synchronized advertising campaigns that trigger prompted searches through television ads — and then scoop up the prompted search traffic by offering deals and sharing holiday-related content on all their channels, including social media. Businesses can maximize the value of their social media spaces with prompted search by adhering to a few tips: Be ready for the moment. Chicago businesses knew Game 7 was going to happen. They just didn’t know the outcome or the time the game would end. Smart businesses prepared by making their brands visible when the Cubs won. Doing so meant having a strategy and resources in place for the moment — and being willing to accept the possibility that the moment might not happen. Take advantage of what each social channel has to offer. Twitter is perfect for posting content in real-time or near real time. Facebook is especially effective for sharing deep content such as details about an event you’re hosting or products you’re promoting. Pinterest is great for posting merchandise for sale. Google+ remains important for optimizing searches. Understand how people are searching and why on each channel. Coordinate across channels. I mentioned the Museum of Science & Industry’s use of Facebook to promote an admission discount. The MSI also gets kudos for cross-promoting the deal across other channels, such as email. And, as I noted, retailers such as Target integrate social with a number of channels, especially mainstream advertising for triggering prompted searches. Of course, on an ongoing basis, you need to make sure you’re managing the fundamental elements of a successful social media presence, such as ensuring that your data is accurate and your content is sharable. By treating your social media presence as an essential touchpoint for prompted search, you’ll be ready to seize the day — and make your own opportunities to make location marketing more effective.

Finance Search Mon, Nov 21, 2016, 4:45 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 5 hrs 15 mins Google Earth sheds light on solar rooftopAAP – Thu, Nov 17, 2016 3:10 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print During his free time on the job as a Google employee, Carl Elkin began tinkering with the company's 3D mapping program, wondering if it could identify rooftops that receive enough sunlight to make installing solar panels worthwhile. When months later the U.S.-based engineer showed a handful of colleagues the results of his labor, they had a eureka moment. "The lightbulb kind of went off," said Joel Conkling, Elkin's colleague at the California-based company. "It felt like intuitively it had some real potential." Soon after, a team followed Elkin's lead and designed Project Sunroof. The project website uses Google Earth's high-resolution aerial images to calculate any roof's solar energy potential. For homeowners, figuring out whether installing thousands of dollars worth of solar panels is a sound investment can be confusing. Project Sunroof aims to make the decision easier - and speed up the adoption of solar energy, which today accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. electricity generation. Homeowners interested in assessing their property's solar potential can enter their address on Project Sunroof's website, and in roughly a second get a calculation of how many hours of usable sunlight their roof receives, Conkling said. Thousands of lines of computer code analyze factors such as the shade trees cast on a roof, its orientation and local weather patterns, he said. Project Sunroof then connects users whose roof is suitable for solar panels with companies that install them. "People can come in and very quickly and very easily get a pretty sophisticated understanding of their solar potential and whether it makes sense for them to go solar," said Conkling, a product manager for Project Sunroof. The response has been encouraging, he said. In September, Project Sunroof was among 13 projects from around the world to win a Momentum for Change award, which recognises innovative and potentially transformative ways to tackle climate change and move toward a low-carbon future. "We were impressed by the scalability of the technology with more and more states and homes able to utilize it," said Nick Nuttall, a spokesman for the Bonn-based U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, which presents the award. Since launching last year, Project Sunroof has expanded from offering analysis of rooftops in two states to 42 states, from New York to California. Thousands of users have been connected with solar-panel installers, Conkling told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In many states, homeowners who produce solar energy can sell all or part of it the power grid. Such payments - and other incentives - are often essential to help offset the steep upfront investment, which can run between $17,000 and $24,000 for a typical solar panel system, according to data from research firm GTM Research. Other U.S. companies also map the solar potential of roofs, including Geostellar and Mapdwell. But Conkling said he is confident that Google Earth's global reach and high definition images can help it cover more ground and provide estimates with an unprecedented degree of accuracy. Nuttall, of the U.N. climate secretariat, agrees the system potentially could be used in many more places. "There seems no reason why one day it could not go global," he said. In recent years, Google has invested nearly $2.5 billion in clean energy wind and solar projects, according to the company's corporate website. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Asia-Pacific leaders defend trade against Trump tideAFP Asia-Pacific leaders are expected to send a strong message in defense of free trade Sunday as they wrap up a summit … Trump tipped to meet QueenAAP PM coy on parental leave compromiseAAP Possible a workplace bill could pass: ALPAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7334 -0.0082 -1.10% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5943 -0.0026 -0.44% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6935 -0.0042 -0.60% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Adelaide Accommodation Four Nations Final Mobile phone Ivanka Trump iPad Kanye West Avis Volkswagen Cheap international flights Nicole Kidman Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Google Earth VR is available today as a free download on Steam featuring 175 cities with full 3D data, and over 600 ‘urban cores’, for completely explorable, virtual reality-optimized experiences all over the world. The project has been in development for some time by the team behind Google Maps and the original Google Earth. It’s conceptually similar to the version of Street View that Google released on its Cardboard and Daydream platforms, except at a more massive scale. Google Earth VR’s primary locomotion system is flight, you begin your journey looking at the Earth from space, and from there you can then rotate the globe and choose where to begin zooming in. If you can't decide where where to take go, Google has also included cinematic tours through places like the Amazon River, the Grand Canyon, the Swiss Alps, Manhattan and more. The app uses a blend of satellite, aerial and Street View images like the original Google Earth, so how good a particular city looks depends on how much data Google has collected. But it should make up for the most immersive Google Earth experience so far and navigations seems intuitive too — just point where you want to go and press the clearly labeled buttons. For now, Earth VR is Vive-only, although VR Apps product manager Mike Podwal says Google is “actively exploring support for other platforms.” We assume the company’s own Daydream platform is on that list. This is the second Vive app that Google has released, after painting app Tilt Brush, which it acquired along with VR development studio Skillman & Hackett in 2014.

There were also fears that Brexit could harm foreign investment, but Google has helped alleviate these worries by announcing a new London HQ and the creation of 3000 jobs by 2020. Currency fluctuations have seen Apple, HTC, and a host of other firms increase the price of their UK goods this year, but Sundar Pichai believes the country is still an attractive place to do business. Speaking to the BBC, the Google CEO said: "We see big opportunities here. This is a big commitment from us - we have some of the best talent in the world in the UK and to be able to build great products from here sets us up well for the long term." Google’s investment, which will reach over $1 billion, will see a new building that’s 10-storeys high with 650,000 square feet of floorspace built near its Kings Cross offices. Google currently has around 4000 employees in the UK; a figure that could almost double to 7000 by the end of the decade. The new site was first announced over three years ago, but founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin put the project on hold after they called the initial plans, by London-based architects AHMM, “too boring.” Google has been virtually silent on the subject up until now. The revamped HQ has been designed by Thomas Heatherwick in collaboration with Danish architects Bjarke Ingels Group. Pichai did warn that Brexit may have complicated “secondary effects” over the long term, but he didn’t go into specifics. He also added that the UK putting restrictions on the number of skilled migrants was a “worry.” Related Reads London Borough ditches Windows XP in favor of Google Chromebooks Microsoft becomes the latest company to raise its UK prices as a result of Brexit London police are considering the use of drones in motorcycle pursuits 11 comments 94 interactions Share this article: Video Highlight Now Read This… Make Chrome faster and keep RAM usage under control Samsung's latest acquisition and next-gen text messaging Google's new PhotoScan app makes it easy to bring your prints into the digital world Popular 38 comments Make Chrome great again: Performance and memory tweaks 11 comments Samsung SSD 960 Evo 500GB Review: The king of the TLC hill Load Comments 11 ...

OnePlus 3T vs Google Pixel XL: Would You Prefer the Half-Priced Competitor? OnePlus 3T is official now with upgraded internals and a real half-priced competitor to Google Pixel XL. By: Chakri Kudikala Published: Thursday, November 17, 2016, 9:00 [IST] OnePlus, after numerous leaks and rumors, has finally made the OnePlus 3T official at an event in London. The smartphone is priced at USD 439 (roughly Rs. 29,800) for the 64GB variant and USD 479 for the (roughly Rs. 32,500) 128GB variant. The company hasn't revealed any information whether the smartphone will hit the Indian shores or not. The OnePlus 3T is touted as a minor upgrade over the OnePlus 3 with powerful hardware and it is equally competitive to the Google Pixel XL. SEE ALSO: Good News for Samsung Loyalists: Galaxy Note 7 Might Make Its Way to India Very Soon Here's how the OnePlus 3T stands against the Google Pixel XL. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Design In terms of design, the OnePlus 3T has the same design as its predecessor, OnePlus 3 with all metal body. On the other hand, the Pixel XL comes with a unique design of metal uni-body and a piece of glass on the back for the fingerprint and camera sensor. QHD Display on the Google Pixel XL The Google Pixel XL comes with a 5.5-inch display with a QHD resolution and the display is pretty much decent. The OnePlus 3T also comes with the same display size, however, has an only 1080p resolution. So, the display section belongs to the Google phone. Click Here for New Android Smartphones Best Online Deals OnePlus 3T has 6GB of RAM Hardware wise, both the OnePlus 3T and Google Pixel XL comes with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, but the Pixel XL has only 4GB of RAM, which is a bit of a letdown when compared to the OnePlus 3T's 6GB of RAM. Both the smartphones come in different storage variants starting from 32GB. The latest addition to the OnePlus 3T is the 128GB storage variant. Better Front-Facing Camera on OnePlus 3T One of the biggest upgrade over the OnePlus 3 in the OnePlus 3T is the 16MP front-facing camera, which is way higher than the Pixel's 8MP front-facing camera. The Google Pixel XL's camera is rated as the best smartphone's camera and the results are pretty amazing as well. Battery and Software In terms of battery size, the OnePlus 3T comes with a 3400mAh battery and the Google Pixel XL comes with 3450mAh battery. Software wise, you get the latest Android experience on Pixel XL with the Android 7.1 Nougat and it has some unique features such as the Google Assistant. The OnePlus 3T comes with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow based Oxygen OS and the Chinese firm has already promised an upgrade to Android Nougat by the end of this year.

The Google Photoscan app is the latest, and it’s one you’ll want to pick up if you have a lot of old-school photos lying about. Cameras on smartphones can be used for so much more than photos these days. Scanning is one popular function, and there are apps that let you scan everything from legal documents to ordinary old photographs. Google is joining the fray this week with the Google Photoscan app, and considering they know a thing or two about photos, it’s a perfect partnership. 35mm may not be dead, but camera phones have put a large dent in traditional photo taking for most folks. If you are like most of us, you have a lot of memories lying around in boxes and books. Sharing those socially isn’t easy, but it can be with the Google Photoscan app. As the name implies, the app will scan your old photos into the digital realm and it’s built to be quick and painless. The Google Photoscan app is available to download for free if you sport an Android or iOS device. We haven’t tested this one out in full yet, but you can expect a full review next week. Hit up the links if you are ready to take the Photoscan app for a spin.

Uber operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes. However, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations. “Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),” Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan’s Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday. Liang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world. It is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with. Uber and Apple did not immediately respond with comments. A Google spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further. Taiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday. Uber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. It entered the Taiwan market in 2013, and its growing popularity has triggered anger from domestic taxi drivers, who staged a massive protest against Uber earlier this year.

GE discourages Muslim children from pursuing STEM education! Engineer due to testify in case against Bechtel found shot to death! Walmart sells Chinese-made toy that kills 100s of children! CVS importing fake drugs from Syria! None of these stories, of course, are true, nor have they appeared anywhere. I made them up. But that doesn’t mean these stories and others like them—stories that could influence perceptions of your company and affect its sales—couldn’t appear on some obscure site you’ve never heard of and spread like wildfire through social media. Welcome to the era of fake news The coverage of fake news has exploded since Donald Trump’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election. Craig Silverman reports on BuzzFeed that fake election news produced more engagement on Facebook than the top stories from the biggest mainstream news sites during the last three months of the campaigns. Fake news stories delivered 8.7 million shares, reactions, and comments, compared to 7.3 million for mainstream news, according to the BuzzFeed analysis. So prevalent is fake news that Oxford Dictionaries has proclaimed post-truth the word of the year. The term refers to “circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than emotional appeals.” That definition encompasses more than just fake news, but there’s no question that fake news contributed greatly to the elevation of the post-truth concept. Consider an August report that Hillary Clinton’s super PAC planned to spend $1 million to correct misinformation on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram—more than three times spent to turn out Latino voters. Election-related fake news was predominantly created to boost Trump’s candidacy, inspiring supporters to spread the stories among like-minded people on the key social media sites. Among the stories that gained traction, on display in a Huffington Post piece, included… Denzel Washington Backs Trump In The Most Epic Way Possible Pope Francis Just Backed Trump, Released Incredible Statement Why FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide George Soros: ‘I’m going to Bring down the U.S. by Funding Black Hate Groups’ Germany Folds To Shariah Law, Approves Child Marriages Doctor Who Treated Hillary’s Blood Clots Found Dead Some of these posts linked to publications that don’t actually exist (with sites created just to host that one fake story). Others linked to articles (on Snopes.com, for example) that actually disprove the assertion the post made. Still others were published on extremist websites whose writers were not beholden to principles of credible journalism. Some were on websites published by teens, many of whom lived in the Macedonian town of Veles, who figured out that creating this red meat for Trump supporters earned them money via Google’s AdSense product. Now that the election is over, it’s not unreasonable to expect the torrent of fake news to subside. Don’t bet on it, though. The same factions that spread it on behalf of a presidential candidate are likely to keep up the pace in support of their political agenda (and to build consensus against their rivals). Still, with the passions of the election receding, some creators of fake news are likely to turn their attention to businesses they love or hate. Meanwhile, non-political operatives will undoubtedly learn the lesson of the 2016 election and apply similar tactics against businesses. The list of potential motives is endless: anti-corporate activism, unsavory union tactics, competitive harassment, dissatisfied shareholders, unethical stock traders, even ethics-challenged, bottom-feeding PR practitioners… But aren’t social networks taking steps to end fake news? Yes, they are, though some of it is being undertaken reluctantly. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a tech conference, “That it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea. There’s a profound lack of empathy in asserting the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news.” A Twitter spokesperson echoed the sentiment, arguing that “Scapegoating social media for an election result ignores the vital roles that candidates, journalists and voters play in the democratic process.” Not everyone agrees. Frank Speiser, co-founder of social media analytics company SocialFlow believes the algorithms that decide what people will see on social networks had so outsized an impact that he (unlike most pollsters and journalists) called the election for Trump. (He was also right in his prediction that Brits would vote to leave the European Union based on the same data.) Whether Zuck agrees that fake news spread on Facebook influenced election results is academic. It’s a bona fide shitstorm and doing nothing is not an option. Facebook told the Wall Street Journal it won’t allow fake news websites to tap into the company’s ad network. Google has implemented a similar ban. Presumably, that will keep kids in Macedonia from churning out fake news as clickbait to earn folding money. Additionally, a group of Facebook employees have formed an off-the-books task force that takes issue with their boss’s assertion that fake news didn’t play a role in the outcome of the election. The task force has met twice in the last week or so, in secret, but plans to go public with a list of recommendations for the social network’s leaders. But let’s be realistic. Efforts by Facebook, Google, and others to stifle fake news will fail. This genie is out of the bottle. Now that people know fake news produces real outcomes, they will find ways around the blocks, just as spammers and hackers who deploy computer viruses have. Further, not every fake news creator has a profit motive. Someone out to depress a company’s share price, create hysteria about a company’s practices or build a movement against a CEO couldn’t care less if the fake story produces revenue. Their only interest is seeing it spread. It is far simpler to get fake news to go viral than it is to spread real news (or even a marketing video). All you need to do is make it sensational enough to appeal to people whose passions on that topic are already easily inflamed, then make sure to seed it in forums those people are likely to see. For example, imagine how many environmental activists might spread a story proclaiming a company had been pouring mercury in a river that resulted in hundreds of local residents suffering agonizing deaths without verifying its accuracy. Fake news targeting companies has already begun In fact, businesses are already targets of fake news, though the election connection is still part of it. PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi is the target of Trump supporters calling for a boycott of Pepsi products based on her statement that Trump voters should “take their business elsewhere.” It’s something she never said. The fake quote appeared on sites like Truthfeed and Gateway Pundit, which also claimed the company’s stock had fallen 5% because of Nooyi’s anti-Trump stance. Except it was a statement she never made, and Pepsi’s stock price . The fake news is apparently retaliation over Nooyi’s condemnation of the campaign’s nasty rhetoric and a statement that her employees were worried about Trump’s election. But Nooyi also congratulated Trump on his election. Pepsi’s stock has fallen in recent days, but mostly because it has “entered oversold territory,” which has nothing to do with the election. While Google may block fake news producers from earning AdSense revenue, if the fake news gains traction, it still trends high in search results; it was the fourth listing in Google News, shown below: Appearing in Google News lends the fake story a certain amount of legitimacy all by itself. And, like I say, it won’t be long before we start seeing these kinds of stories about businesses sans the election angle. So what can companies do? Suggestions for how to deal with fake news are the subject of a lot of content. For example, media studies professor Brian Hughes writes on CNN that the U.S. needs the equivalent of the Fairness Doctrine, a 1950s FCC regulation that required the three TV networks to air opposing views for every perspective it presented from a party or candidate. “It should be possible,” Hughes writes, “to individually program our news feeds for balance and accuracy. If services like Facebook and Google are allowed to become news-aggregating monopolies, it’s only reasonable to expect them to serve the public good as well as the bottom line.” Even if that’s practical (and I’m not sure it is), it doesn’t ensure fake business news would be subject to that balanced presentation of content. From a monitoring perspective, companies would be well served to identify fake news as early as possible. That means tweaking existing monitoring services to watch for fake news. It also means keeping an eye on the sites that are known to produce it; several lists already already exist, like this, this (although it hasn’t been updated since mid-January). There is also a Chrome extension that will display a pop-up warning if you visit a site that has been flagged on Professor Zimdars’s list, which could make it easy to check the validity of any story that crosses your feed. While identifying fake news is easy, quashing it is hard. Consider the cool $1 million Clinton’s super PAC spent to tamp it down, yet she still lost. Getting advocates and ambassadors to correct the record could be effective. It could also result in those employees and supporters themselves being targeted. Earning and buying media to correct the record may not reach the news feeds of those inclined to believe the fake story—and keep in mind that, according to the Pew Research Center, more and more people get their news through social media. There are plenty of stories about the fake news targeting PepsiCo, and even a Snopes.com article laying out the facts, yet the fake news story itself is still trending in Google News and spreading through social channels. Legal action could result in a takedown of the original story but have little impact on its reproduction elsewhere and its dispersion through social channels. I’m open to ideas about how to deal with damaging fake news that spreads about a company, its leaders, its employees, or its products or services. I suspect we’ll have to wait until it becomes a thing to assess the effectiveness of various tactics. At this point, your best defense is vigilance along with some serious discussions involving PR, legal, risk management, and other interested departments about tactics your company should be ready to deploy. With all the news about fake news, the worst thing to do is nothing. 11/16/16 | 0 Comments | PR needs to be ready for fake news targeting companies Comment Form Enter Your Comment: Your Name: Your Email: Location: URL: Remember my personal information Notify me of follow-up comments?

Nov 2016 03:24 MEZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken (Tesla's latest Autopilot system uses Nvidia's computer platform for autonomous vehicles.Tesla) Automakers and tech companies are racing to get the first self-driving car on the road.   Ford, GM, Tesla, Lyft, Google, and more all have plans to have some form of autonomous car ready for commercial use within the next five years. In fact, it's estimated that by 2030 driverless cars could make up as much as 60% of US auto sales, according to Goldman Sachs. While companies all have their own reasons for investing in this technology, they all agree that one of the biggest benefits of autonomous cars will be improved safety. How, might you ask, is a car with no human driver, no steering wheel, and no brake pedal safer than the cars we currently drive? Well, it all comes down to the tech used to enable autonomous vehicles. The sensors Driverless cars are designed to have almost a superhuman-like ability to recognize the world around them. This is because they use loads of sensors to gather tons of data about their environment so that they can seamlessly operate in a constantly changing environment. Essentially, companies developing autonomous vehicles are really just trying to replicate how a human drives using these sensors.  (Google self-driving car project) "As a human you have senses, you have your eyes, you have your ears, and sometimes you have the sense of touch, you are feeling the road. So those are your inputs and then those senses feed into your brain and your brain makes a decision on how to control your feet and your hands in terms of braking and pressing the gas and steering. So on an autonomous car you have to replace those senses," Danny Shapiro, senior director of Nvidia’s automotive business unit, told Business Insider. Some of the sensors used on autonomous cars include cameras, radar, lasers, and ultrasonic sensors. GPS and mapping technology are also used to help the car determine it's position.  All of these have different strengths and weaknesses, but essentially they enable a lot of data to flow into the car. The brain  All of this collected data is then fed into the car’s computer system, or “brain,” so to speak, and is processed so that the car can make decisions. (NVIDIA) One of the leading companies building the brains for these cars is the chipmaker Nvidia. In fact, Tesla’s Autopilot system uses Nvidia’s Drive PX2, which is the company’s newest computer system for autonomous cars. Drive PX2 is a powerful computer platform about the size of a license plate that uses a variety of Nvidia's chips and software to take all of the data coming in from the sensors on an autonomous car to build a three-dimensional model of the car's environment, Shapiro said.  “In the brain of the car, it almost looks like a video game. We are essentially recreating the world in a virtual 3D space,” he said. To do this, Nvidia and other companies developing driverless tech use a little something called machine learning. How it learns Machine learning is a way of teaching algorithms by example or experience and companies are using it for all kinds of things these days. For example, Netflix and Amazon both use machine learning to make recommendations based on what you have watched or purchased in the past.   So to train a self-driving car, you would first drive the car hundreds of miles to collect sensor data. You would then process that data in a data center identifying frame by frame what each object is. (How Google's self-driving car sees the world using lidar sensors.YouTube/SXSW) “Initially, the computer doesn’t know anything. We have to teach it. And so what we want to do is if we want to teach it to recognize pedestrians, we would feed it pictures of pedestrians. But what we can do is feed it millions pictures of pedestrians because pedestrians look different,” Shapiro said. “The more data we feed it the more vocabulary it has and the more it can recognize what a pedestrian is. And we do the same thing with bicyclists, cars, trucks, and we do it at all times of day and different weather conditions. So again, essentially it has this infinite capability to build up a memory and understanding of what all of these different types of things could encounter would look like,” he said.

Click here for full episodes   It might sound complicated, but when you think about it, it’s not that different from how humans learn. When you were born, you didn’t know what anything was. But your parents or whoever raised you repeatedly pointed things out so that you could identify different objects and people. Superhuman driving skills Once a computer model is created, then it’s loaded into the car’s brain and hooked up to the rest of the car’s sensors to create real-world model of the car’s environment. The car uses this model to make decisions about how it should respond in different situations. And because the car has sensors all around it, it has access to a lot more data than a human driver to help it make those decisions. “There are insightful factors that get factored in. For example, if you are driving along and there’s a parked car with nobody in it, the vehicle will proceed next to that car,” Shapiro said. “But if it sees the door is slightly open and there is somebody in it, well the expectation is that the door will open at any moment and someone will to try and get out of that car. So at that point, when the car senses that, it’s either going to slow down, or switch lanes if it can, and proceed with caution. And because it has a full 360 degrees view around the car, it can be tracking multiple objects, with much greater things happening, with much greater accuracy than any human.” (Codebreaker, the podcast from Marketplace and Business Insider, asks "can it save us?"

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Nov 16, 2016 at 1:18PM Image source: Google. Google is by far the biggest digital advertising company in the world, taking about $3 out of every $10 spent on online advertising in 2016. The Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary's ability to attract visitors and to monetize its search engine is at the core of its ad revenue. Recently, however, a growing percentage of its revenue is coming from YouTube -- which is evident in the impact on its average ad price. But after YouTube, investors may be wondering where Google's next growth spurt will come from. In fact, you might already be using a product analysts at Baird believe will generate $5 billion in revenue for Google by 2020. Google Maps could be the next big growth driver of Google's ad revenue. Maps monetization strategy Google CEO Sundar Pichai believes Maps is closely tied with local search on mobile. Indeed, a lot of searches for a nearby establishment are actually better suited for Maps, and Google will redirect users to the app when appropriate. When it comes to placing ads or otherwise monetizing local searches and Maps, it's really about "enhancing the local search experience," Pichai told analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call. "I think you'll continue to see us pursue it that way. And over time, to the extent there are opportunities to create value within the application itself, we'll pursue that as well," he added. Google already allows businesses to buy Promoted Pins, which display businesses such as restaurants or gas stations along their routes. That's useful on long road trips, where you'll need to stop at those types of locations. It could also move into local restaurant and business advertising for when users search for generic places such as "Mexican food" or "grocery store." That would put Google in even closer competition with local search players such as Yelp (NYSE:YELP), which has complained about unfair tactics from Google in the past. In particular, it complained about Google's favoring of Google+ and Zagat reviews (Google owns Zagat) in organic search results even for searches using the keyword "yelp." Yelp generated $580 million in local ad revenue over the previous four quarters. With over 10 times the traffic (Maps has 1 billion global users), the opportunity is even bigger for Maps. Strategic partnerships and co-opting services Another way Google is able to add value to Maps while monetizing it at the same time is through strategic partnerships. One example is including Uber and other taxi services in its app, along with estimates as to how much a ride will cost. Alphabet's investment arm, Google Capital, owns a stake in Uber. Google could also integrate services such as food delivery or reservations into Maps to both enhance and monetize the product. Importantly, Google is working on all of these services itself. It's already testing a ride-sharing service built on top of Waze in the Bay Area and Tel Aviv. If it can feed enough users into Uber or some other service, it might be able to launch its own service and rapidly reach scale. What's more, the data it collects from referring users to Uber or other services can inform the features and rollout of new products. Going forward, investors should look for Google to move into more partnerships or launch its own services within Google Maps. The move effectively diversifies beyond advertising while providing additional utility to the app. Meanwhile, analysts at Morgan Stanley believe its advertisements could generate an additional $1.5 billion for Google next year. But to get to $5 billion, as Baird analysts predict, it might take a little bit more than ads. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

On the same day that Google announced its translation services were now operating with its Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system, a team of researchers released a paper on arXiv showing how its NMT could be pushed one step further. An NMT is a large single neural network that learns to translate by being trained on a pair of languages. Google Translate has been around for ten years, and before an NMT was used, it often provided a clumsy attempt at translation. Sentences could be lost in translation because individual phrases were translated together instead of whole sentences. First, the encoder breaks down the sentence into its constituent words and represents the meaning as a vector. The system interprets the whole sentence, and the decoder begins to translate each word by looking at the weighted distribution over the encoded vectors and matching them up to the most relevant words in the target language. Google now promises to provide better translations that are “smoother and easier to read” for eight language pairs: English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. Photo credit: Google For many NMTs, the machine encodes the sentence into vectors by focusing on each word individually – something called the “attention mechanism.” Several attention mechanisms were required to cope with different languages, and multiple encoders and decoders are used for translation. But when a single attention mechanism is used for multiple languages, the system can be coaxed into learning to translate between pairs of languages it hasn’t encountered before – something the researchers call “zero-shot translation.” “For example, a multilingual NMT model trained with Portuguese→English and English→Spanish examples can generate reasonable translations for Portuguese→Spanish, although it has not seen any data for that language pair,” the paper said. Interestingly, the researchers found evidence that the network was learning “some sort of shared representation,” where sentences with similar meaning were represented in similar ways regardless of language. Training the model across multiple languages can enhance the performance of translating into individual languages, and the system can even cope better with sentences that are written in a mixture of languages. Although the researchers only used a maximum of 12 language pairs for a single model, it would be easy to add more, and simple to use, as it operates on the same architecture as the NMT currently being used by Google Translate. Zero-shot translation is the first time that “true transfer learning” has been shown to work for machine translation, according to the researchers. Transfer learning is considered key to developing true machine intelligence, as systems must learn to deal with new situations based on knowledge gained from previous experiences. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 29 Comments More from The Register Microsoft redfaced after Bing translation cockup enrages Saudis Daesh/Saudi Arabia snafu leads to calls for boycott 76 Comments Radian ready to replace the flash translation layer It's all about the speed baby, speed, speed, speed 8 Comments Google admits 'garbage in, garbage out' translation problem Research supremo cops to Google Translate loop the loop 17 Comments Microsoft demos real-time English to Chinese translation Digital babel fish comes closer 21 Comments Electric Babel Fish swims into crowdfunding An outfit called Waverly Labs claims to have developed an in-ear translator 36 Comments Google Translate for Android adds offline translation option Not quite as handy as a Babel Fish, but almost 22 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Antivirus tools are a useless box-ticking exercise says Google security chap Kiwicon Google senior security engineer Darren Bilby has asked fellow hackers to expend less effort on tools like antivirus and intrusion detection to instead research more meaningful defences such as whitelisting applications. The incident responder from Google's Sydney office, who is charged with researching very advanced attacks including the 2009 Operation Aurora campaign, decried many existing tools as ineffective "magic" that engineers are forced to install for the sake of compliance but at the expense of real security. "Please no more magic," he told the Kiwicon hacking conference in Wellington, New Zealand today. "We need to stop investing in those things we have shown do not work." "And sure you are going to have to spend some time on things like intrusion detection systems because that's what the industry has decided is the plan, but allocate some time to working on things that actually genuinely help." Bilby wants security types to focus on tools such as whitelisting, hardware security keys and dynamic access rights efforts like Google's Beyond Corp internal project. "Antivirus does some useful things, but in reality it is more like a canary in the coal mine. It is worse than that. It's like we are standing around the dead canary saying 'Thank god it inhaled all the poisonous gas'," he said. The Google hacker also argued that networks are not a security defence because users are so easily able to use mobile networks to upload data to cloud services, bypassing all traditional defences. Advice on safe internet use is "horrible", he added. Telling users not to click on phishing links and to download strange executables effectively shifts blame to them and away from those who manufactured hardware and software that is not secure enough to be used online. "We are giving people systems that are not safe for the internet and we are blaming the user." Referring to the 314 remote code execution holes disclosed in Adobe Flash last year alone, he compared the strategy to patch those holes to a car yard which sells vehicles that catch on fire every other week. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 120 Comments More from The Register Snowden says Russia ‘probably responsible’ for NSA hack Shadow Брокеры? 32 Comments #Shadowbrokers hack could be Russia's DNC counter-threat to NSA Claimed NSA hacker outfit Equation group confirmed to be breach victim. 15 Comments 'NSA' hack okshun woz writ by Inglish speeker trieing to hyde Linguist says perps of zero day dump wanted to pose as gramatically-incorrect aliens 34 Comments Report: NSA hushed up zero-day spyware tool losses for three years Investigation shows staffer screw-up over leak 23 Comments Shadow Brokers leak systems hacked by NSA – mostly mail and uni servers in India, China With gibberish encouraging disruption of the US election 12 Comments NSA boss reveals top 3 security nightmares that keep him awake at night RSA 2016 Hint: None of them are Apple 64 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

(File | AP) NEW DELHI: Tech giant google has now made it a lot easier for its users to preserve old photographs and family portraits in old photo albums with the launch of its new scanning app. Called the Google Photoscan, the app allows users to scan and digitise physical photographs with high quality results. According to the technology company, the reason for coming up with an app like this was due to a high and un-catered to demand among internet users. “We all have those old albums and boxes of photos that are some of our most treasured memories. Such as photos of  your grandma when she was young, or of your childhood pet, and even that hairstyle you wish you could forget. But we just keep thinking about scanning the photos to preserve these moments, but never really get around to it. Well, here is an easy option,” Google stated. Google had also recently released five new products tailor made for the Indian market — including one product designed to bring free Wi-Fi to the world. The new India offerings had include new video app YouTube Go, the Google Assistant in Hindi inside messaging app Allo, data-saving features on Chrome and faster browsing for Google Play on 2G connections. Google PhotoScan meanwhile, is a brand new standalone app from Google Photos that can easily scan any photo from anywhere. The app is available for free for Android and iOS devices from their respective app stores. The app can also detect edges, straighten the image, rotate it to the correct orientation and remove the glare. It can scan photos using the camera built into the user’s smartphone’s in a way that removes glares and shadows, improving the overall quality. The app also enables the transfer of photos to and from the cloud library of the user as the app works with Google Photos.

Amazon Echo or Google Home? I use them both. Here's my pick for you. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Networking | November 17, 2016 -- 00:50 GMT (16:50 PST) | Topic: Cloud This is not an easy choice. On the one hand, you have the original and champion home audio computer, the Amazon Echo. On the other, the new kid on the block and contender, the Google Home. I've used an Echo for almost a year now and the Home for a few weeks. Here's what I found. Google Home or Amazon Echo? Both are good, but which one is better? sjvn First, they're both useful. I don't have review units of these. I bought both of them: The Echo for $179 and the Home for $129. Both will be on sale for $20 to $40 less on Black Friday. Special Feature Cloud - How to Do SaaS Right Software as a Service offers irresistible benefits for organizations of all sizes — from cost savings to scalability to mobile accessibility. Read More I have both because -- spoiler alert -- I'm a tech geek, and they're both useful. Both are cylinder-shaped speakers that listen to your commands. They get their smarts from their respective cloud services. To connect with the cloud they both use Wi-Fi. Considering their size, both do a remarkably good job of playing music and listening to you. When it comes to audio quality, neither will be mistaken for a Bose Soundtouch 20, but for what they are, they do well. I could talk about the engineering inside each, but while that's interesting, what really powers both is their cloud computing brains. Both are attached to your Amazon and Google accounts respectively. If you're concerned about your privacy, neither is a good choice. But, if you don't mind the companies knowing that, for example, I like listening to ESPN's Pardon the Interruption, you'll find both of them useful. The easiest way to use either device is as a smart radio. After activating them with their alert phrases -- "Alexa" for Echo and "Okay Google" or "Hey Google" for Home -- you can ask to listen to your favorite music streaming services, internet radio stations, artists, or songs. Both also allow you to listen to your own music collections if they're on their respective cloud services. You can also use either device to control Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Both support an ever-growing number of IoT gadgets. For now, both support Nest, Samsung SmartThings, Philips Hue, and IFTTT. Google Home also enables you to play audio to your home stereo or video to your TV by using Google Chromecast. For Echo to play audio on your existing speakers you'll need the Echo Dot. For video, you'll need the Alexa Voice Remote and an Amazon Fire Stick. That's just scratching the surface. Where things really get interesting is how they do as personal assistants. Echo vs. Home Feature Chart CNET Here is where Google pulls ahead. If you already use Google services, and I do, Google Home already knows a lot about you. It takes in data from programs such as Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Maps, and uses it to help you. For example, I can ask it what my schedule is for the day, and it just tells me. Google's search and AI smarts also come into play. If I ask it, "Who plays Han Solo?" It will tell me, "Harrison Ford". I can then follow up with, "What other movies has he been in?" and Home will list his other films. Amazon, on the other hand, simply doesn't answer questions all that well. However, you can use Echo to order items from Amazon. It also is integrated with Audible, Amazon's audiobook service. I love audiobooks so that's a big win in my book. Since the Echo has been around for two years, it does have a good number of third party applications. These are called "Skills." Some of them are good, but I'm underwhelmed by most of them. Yo mama jokes? Seriously? Where, in my experience, Home really pulls away from Echo is in voice-recognition. Besides giving me better answers, Home understands my voice commands and questions much more often than Echo does. That may be because Google already "knows" my voice thanks to my use of first Google Now and its successor, Google Assistant. Regardless of how it does it, Home outshines Echo in this vital area. Both products will improve quickly. The real smarts as I mentioned earlier aren't in the devices. It's in the cloud services that power them. I expect them both to become ever more useful as the months roll by. That said, if I could only have one device, it would be the Google Home. I won't be getting rid of my Echo, but Home has several advantages: It's cheaper, it "understands" me better, and it gives me better answers. For my home assistant those are exactly the features I want.
