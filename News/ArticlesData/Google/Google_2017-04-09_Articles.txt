On April 7, Google announced that it was rolling out its fact-checking feature worldwide to filter the web, ensuring useful and high-quality information. The Fact Check tag was introduced by the company in October 2016, weeks before the US presidential election, but was available only for users from the US and UK. Now the tech giant is rolling out the feature worldwide. © REUTERS/ Dado Ruvic Facebook Plans to Pay Fact-Checkers for Detecting Fake NewsThe Fact Check label is meant to identify information, fact checked by news publishers and fact-checking organizations, Google says in its blog. If a claim is checked, the website will display general information on it, the person who made this claim and show if it's true or false. The feature isn't available yet for every search result and there may be pages, checked by different publishers and even where differing conclusions are presented. The Fact Check community consists of 115 organizations, Google says. The move comes just after another tech giant, Facebook, has implemented a solution to deal with so-called "fake news" of its own. The company introduced several measures, including working with paid third-party fact-checkers, introducing stricter policies of ad selling and creating new products that should help curb untrustworthy information. © Photo: Pixabay Free Speech Vs. Hysteria? California Lawmakers Pull Attempt to Ban ‘Fake News’Unlike Facebook, Google relies on its own algorithms to determine authoritative sources, encouraging news organizations to use the Schema.org ClaimReview markup on pages where they fact check public statements for them to be included in search processes. If a publisher or fact check claim does not meet Google's standards, that site's markup may be ignored or removed from Google News. The term "fake news" became viral during the United States presidential election campaign, after it was widely reported that false and misleading stories posted on different sources, mostly social media, might have influenced the outcome of the presidential election. Later, President Donald Trump re-energized the term, labeling several mainstream media as "fake news" and banning even more of them from a White House daily briefing. ...

By Agamoni Ghosh April 10, 2017 06:43 BST Google is being accused of paying less to women employees Reuters The US government's Department of Labour (DoL) has accused Google of gender-based discriminatory pay practices. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, DoL regional director, testified in a San Francisco court. Google, however, denied the allegations saying it had never heard of such a practice until it was mentioned in court. The Alphabet owned tech giant said it conducts a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders every year and has found no gender pay gap so far. The government's analysis, however, suggests the discrimination against women in Google is quite high according to Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the DoL. The accusations come after the government asked Google, a federal contractor, to hand over salary documents of employees to check the company's compliance with equal opportunity laws. Google's refusal to hand over these documents led to a DoL investigation. The probe reportedly revealed women at the company who were doing the same work as men were being underpaid. Tech companies in the US have regularly been accused of gender discrimination. Uber was recently embroiled in a major sexism controversy. The DoL has also come down heavily on many tech companies like Palantir that allegedly discriminates against Asians, and Oracle that is accused of favouring white males. The DoL has requested the court to cancel all of Google's federal contracts and block any future business with the government if it continues to refuse to comply with the rules.

Share Tweet Share Tags : LG-LG+ Google-Google+ Display-Display+ The next Pixel phone can't come soon enough. With Google I/O conference just around the corner, rumors about the next flagship to be released by the search giant start to pile up. Google had been using a couple of Android partners to build its smartphones, and things will probably not change in the near future. The previous Nexus phone were made by two companies, LG and Huawei, whereas the current Pixel phone have been manufactured by HTC. However, LG is very close to secure another contract from Google if we are to believe the latest reports coming from the Korean media. Up to $880 million await LG's decision to allow Google to invest in its display division, which is supposed to enable the search giant to secure enough OLED panels for its upcoming Pixel phone. Reports from Korea claim Google recently announced LG about its plans to invest 1 trillion won ($880 million) in its OLED display production line. If the South Korean company accepts the offer, Google could increase the size of the investment depending on the details of the contract, such as supply conditions. Google had been using AMOLED displays provided by Samsung for the Pixel and Pixel XL, but it looks like the Mountain View company wants to switch to another display provider. The decision may or may not be related to the latest rumors claiming Apple has struck a deal with Samsung for nearly 70 million bendable OLED displays that will be included in the iPhone 8. We'll see how this goes, but LG Display is expected to provide an answer very soon since the next Pixel phone will be announced in the coming months. source: ETNews (translated) via 9to5Google Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 and 9.7 start getting Android 7.0 Nougat update 09 Apr Prev news Latest rumored OnePlus 5 specs include 8GB of RAM 10 Apr Next news Close Latest rumored OnePlus 5 specs include 8GB of RAM 10 Apr Now reading: Google could invest $880 million in LG's Display division to secure OLED panels for the Pixel 2 Google could invest $880 million in LG's Display division to secure OLED 09 Apr Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 and 9.7 start getting Android 7.0 Nougat update 09 Apr Watch the LG G6 survive a Mouse Trap like adventure and come out unscathed 09 Apr Nokia 9 may cost $699 in the US, to be released at the end of Q3 09 Apr LG confirms Android Wear 2.0 rollout for Watch R and Watch Urbane, the 09 Apr Beats 1 to broadcast live from renovated 5th Avenue Apple Store? 09 Apr Deal: LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE on sale for just $179.99 (55% off) on 09 Apr Best LG G6 screen protectors 09 Apr OnePlus still mum on Android Nougat update for the OnePlus 2 and OnePlus 09 Apr older posts Featured stories   Cameras compared: HTC U Ultra vs Galaxy S7, iPhone, LG G6   Samsung Galaxy S8 display: What's the deal with the new aspect ratio?   Best tablets (Spring 2017)   Best Galaxy S8 preoder deal?

And since Google is investing for their Pixel devices, it wouldn't matter if LG uses them in their G series phones or not. LG can produce OLED displays for other OEMs and still keep using IPS in their own line. posted on 1 hour ago 0 Reply 7. Dr.Phil (Posts: 1483; Member since: 14 Feb 2011) LG does use OLED panels. They've been used in their G Flex line of phones. I believe they've had OLED phone displays for at least a couple years now. posted on yesterday, 23:43 0 Reply 2. PryvateiDz (Posts: 209; Member since: 31 Jul 2011) Dope! This can help keep LG in the mobile business from this profit.

We'll have to wait and see what the real case here. posted on 1 hour ago 0 Reply 4. bbylizard (Posts: 1; Member since: 1 hour ago) I saw LG and Pixel 2 and thought for a second they would go for an LCD panel, glad that's not the case. posted on 1 hour ago 0 Reply 5. burekbrigada (Posts: 20; Member since: 19 Dec 2014) Another "smart analyze" from PA.

Tabby_Tiger (Posts: 186; Member since: 23 Jan 2017) Let's hope Google also invest more in the design department so the Pixel 2 doesn't look so generic and boring. posted on 47 min ago 0 Reply 9. omnitech (Posts: 364; Member since: 28 Sep 2016) Slightly unrelated but I hope the pixel 2 is based on the LG G6 or an exact copy actually with a Sd835 instead of the sd821. view all comments Want to comment?

The investigation isn’t complete but the department has received compelling evidence of “significant discrimination,” the Guardian reported, citing the Labor Department’s regional solicitor, Janet Herold. The allegations come at a time when Silicon Valley is under the microscope like never before for reports of discrimination against women. Uber Technologies Inc. has been investigating claims of sexual harassment from a former engineer, while investors across the tech world are wondering how to transform both start-ups and more established digital companies into more egalitarian workplaces. The testimony couldn’t be immediately confirmed from court records. Representatives of the Labor Department in San Francisco didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.  The department sued Google in January, alleging the company had failed to turn over compensation data and documents as part of a routine compliance evaluation. Google is required to let the government inspect records for an audit because it’s a federal contractor, according to the Labor Department. Also Read: US regulators accuse Google of underpaying female workers Google already has turned over 1.8 million data points and spent more than $500,000 to comply with the requests, including having its engineers build a new tool to extract information from its databases, said Lisa Barnett Sween, litigation manager with Jackson Lewis P.C. in San Francisco, representing Google. A Department of Labor administrative law judge in San Francisco on Friday granted Google’s request for a preliminary protective order on its salary data. Google, like many Silicon Valley companies, fiercely guards compensation used to lure and retain employees.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Uber fires back at Google spinoff in self-driving car case 2017-04-10 06:53 Post a comment 0 share: Waymo Pacifica minivan RELATED ARTICLES Honda in talks with Google on self-drive tech Fiat readies Alphabet’s Waymo 100 self-driving hybrid minivans Uber smartphone apps banned in Italy San Francisco — Uber is scoffing at claims that its expansion into self-driving cars hinges on trade secrets stolen from a Google spinoff, arguing that its ride-hailing service has been working on potentially superior technology. The legal defense, presented in documents filed Friday in San Francisco federal court, marks Uber's first detailed response to explosive allegations that its self-driving cars rely on crucial technology designed by Waymo. That company was created from an autonomous-vehicle project started at Google eight years ago. Once a Google ally, Uber emerged as a rival in the self-driving car market in early 2015 when it began developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. Now, Waymo is trying to thwart that effort by persuading U.S. District Judge William Alsup to block Uber's self-car driving expansion on the grounds that it hinges on a high-tech heist. The case's outcome could alter the race to build self-driving cars that may transform transportation, reduce traffic deaths and launch a huge new industry. Laser Focus Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. After the alleged theft, Levandowski left Google early last year to found a self-driving car startup called Otto that Uber bought for $680 million last August. But Uber is now presenting evidence that it began working on technology dramatically different from Waymo's more than a year before buying Otto. The dispute centers on a pivotal part of self-driving cars called LiDAR, an array of laser-based sensors that enable self-driving cars to see what's around them so they can safely navigate roads. In sworn declarations and diagrams, Uber argued that its engineers are working on a more sophisticated form of LiDAR than Waymo's. Among other things, Uber says its LiDAR uses four lenses for transmitting and receiving laser lights as opposed to the single lens in Waymo's version. "Waymo could not be more wrong, and Uber's design could not be more different," Uber's lawyers wrote in their rebuttal to the allegations. "And no wonder — Uber's LiDAR was developed by a different team, using a different beam pattern, and leveraging different know-how." Weight of Evidence What's more, Uber says its custom-designed LiDAR system hasn't even been installed on the self-driving cars that it has been testing in Pittsburgh, Arizona and San Francisco. Instead, the company says it has been relying on LiDAR systems built by other vendors. Much of the information contained in Friday's filing was redacted to protect confidential business plans and secret technology. Uber may have its work cut out to sway Alsup, who has said in previous court hearings that Waymo has presented some of the strongest evidence he has seen in his judicial career. A hearing on Waymo's request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for May 3. Although Waymo isn't suing him in this case, Levandowski will play a central role in how the lawsuit unfolds. Levandowski helped establish Google as an early leader in self-driving cars, earning him more than $120 million in incentive pay, according to information inadvertently revealed in court papers earlier this week. Before Levandowski defected from Google early last year start Otto, Waymo alleges he downloaded more than 14,000 documents containing trade secrets that is now helping Uber. After buying Otto, Uber put Levandowski in charge of Uber's self-driving project, a job that has been imperiled by this lawsuit. Alsup has warned that he may issue an order barring Levandowski from involvement in Uber's self-driving car division if he sides with Waymo. Uber says it hasn't found any evidence of ever possessing any of the files that Levandowski stands accused of stealing. Levandowski, meanwhile, has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to protect himself if criminal charges are filed against him.

According to South Korea’s Electronic Times, Google has offered to make an $880 million investment in LG’s display division. Nintendo Switch The size of the investment could increase, with Google aiming to secure a stable supply of flexible OLED panels for the next Pixel. Google is specifically making an investment in a facility to help LG boost display output. Notably, LG Display is still “carefully considering” the proposal and has yet to officially agree to the contract. At the moment, the Pixel and Pixel XL use AMOLED displays supplied by Samsung and only feature a slight 2.5D curvature on the edges of the protective Gorilla Glass. A flexible panel would be more in line with the recently announced Galaxy S8 and S8+. The news comes as Apple was rumored to have struck a similar deal with Samsung for 70 million bendable OLED displays for this year’s iPhone Details for the next Pixel are still scant, though we’ve been told in the past by a tipster that a Snapdragon 83X is likely, along with a continued focus on camera performance, and possible waterproofing. Additionally, device codenames have surfaced that point to at least two screen sizes, with Google again having a smaller and larger-sized phone.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google moves shopping lists from Keep to Home app by April 10 By Ida Torres - April 9, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you’ve naturally been keeping your shopping lists in your Google Keep app, there are some slight changes that will be happening by April 10. If you’ve been using Google Assistant to add to your shopping list, your list will be moved from Keep to your Google Home and Express apps. That’s because they’re building up the latter to have an ordering and delivery feature, so it makes sense to have your shopping list there for easier integration with the whole shopping system on your Google apps. When you use the sentence “add wine to my list” or “add chips to my shopping list”, it was previously saving on your Google Keep as a separate shopping list which you can easily access when you’re at the grocery store. But now, the default shopping list will be on your Google Home or Express app, if you use Google Assistant to add to the list. For the past months, Google Home through Express has been slowly letting people shop and order items just by using voice commands. They currently have over 50 retail partners and are looking to add more in order to rival that of Amazon’s. If this will make life simpler for the users, then we’re all for it. Time will tell as this is just starting to roll out. But if you prefer to keep your shopping list in Keep, make a copy of your Google Keep shopping list to a new Keep list. Then delete the shopping list on Keep before April 10 as that’s when the change will roll out. Then Google Home will not be able to copy and integrate your shopping list to its system.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 10 April 2017 | MYT 11:30 AM Beer, bots and broadcasts: Companies start using AI in the Cloud Amazon is the public cloud leader right now, but each company has its strengths. Democratising access to powerful AI software is the latest battleground, and could decide which tech giant emerges as the ultimate winner in a cloud infrastructure market worth US$25bil (RM110.87bil) this year, according to researcher IDC. — Bloomberg Back in October, Deschutes Brewery Inc’s Brian Faivre was fermenting a batch of Obsidian Stout in a massive tank. Something was amiss; the beer wasn’t fermenting at the usual temperature. Luckily, a software system triggered a warning and he fixed the problem.  ”We would have had to dump an entire batch,” the brewmaster said. When beer is your bottom line, that's a calamity.  The software that spotted the temperature anomaly is from Microsoft Corp and it's a new type that uses a powerful form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. What makes it potentially revolutionary is that Deschutes rented the tool over the internet from Microsoft's cloud-computing service.   Day to day, Deschutes uses the system to decide when to stop one part of the brewing process and begin another, saving time while producing better beer, the company says.  The Bend, Oregon-based brewer is among a growing number of enterprises using new combinations of AI tools and cloud services from Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. C-SPAN is using Amazon image-recognition to automatically identify who is in the government TV programmes it broadcasts.  Insurance company USAA is planning to use similar technology from Google to assess damage from car accidents and floods without sending in human insurance adjusters. The American Heart Association is using Amazon voice recognition to power a chat bot registering people for a charity walk in June.  AI software used to require thousands of processors and lots of power, so only the largest technology companies and research universities could afford to use it. An early Google system cost more than US$1mil (RM4.43mil) and used about 1,000 computers. Deschutes has no time for such technical feats. It invests mostly in brewing tanks, not datacentres. Only when Microsoft, Amazon and Google began offering AI software over the Internet in recent years did these ideas seem plausible.   Amazon is the public cloud leader right now, but each company has its strengths. Democratising access to powerful AI software is the latest battleground, and could decide which tech giant emerges as the ultimate winner in a cloud infrastructure market worth US$25bil (RM110.87bil) this year, according to researcher IDC.  ”There's a new generation of applications that require a lot more intense data science and machine learning. There is a race for who is going to provide the tools for that,” said Diego Oppenheimer, chief executive officer of Algorithmia Inc, a startup that runs a marketplace for algorithms that do some of the same things as Microsoft, Amazon and Google's technology.  If the tools become widespread, they could transform work as more automation lets companies get more done with the same human work force.   C-SPAN, which runs three TV stations and five web channels, previously used a combination of closed-caption transcripts and manpower to determine when a new speaker started talking and who it was. It was so time-consuming, the network only tagged about half of the events it broadcast. C-SPAN began toying with Amazon's image-recognition cloud service the same day it launched, said Alan Cloutier, technical manager for the network's archives.  Now the network is using it to match all speakers against a database it maintains of 99,000 government officials. C-SPAN plans to enter all the data into a system that will let users search its website for things like Bernie Sander's healthcare speeches or all times Devin Nunes mentions Russia.   As companies try to better analyse, optimise and predict everything from sales cycles to product development, they are trying AI techniques like deep learning, a type of machine learning that's produced impressive results in recent years. IDC expects spending on such cognitive systems and AI to grow 55% a year for the next five years. The cloud-based portion of that should grow even faster, IDC analyst David Schubmehl said.   ”In the fullness of time deep learning will be one of the most popular workloads on EC2,” said Matt Wood, Amazon Web Services' general manager for deep learning and AI, referring to its flagship cloud service, Elastic Compute Cloud.  Pinterest Inc. uses Amazon's image-recognition service to let users take a picture of an item – say a friend's shoes – and see similar footwear. Schools in India and Tacoma, Washington, are using Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning to predict which students may drop out, and farmers in India are using it to figure out when to plant peanut crops, based on monsoon data. Johnson & Johnson is using Google's Jobs machine-learning algorithm to comb through candidates' skills, preferences, seniority and location to match job seekers to the right roles.  Google is late to the public cloud business and is using its AI experience and massive computational resources to catch up. A new "Advanced Solutions Lab” lets outside companies participate in training sessions with machine-learning experts that Google runs for its own staff. USAA was first to participate, tapping Google engineers to help construct software for the financial-services company. Heather Cox, USAA's chief technology officer, plans a multi-year deal with Google.  The three leaders in the public cloud today have also made capabilities like speech and image recognition available to customers who can design apps that hook into these AI features – Microsoft offers 25 different ones.  ”You can build software that is cognitive – that can sense emotion and understand your intent, recognise speech or what’s in an image – and we provide all of that in the cloud so customers can use it as part of their software,” said Microsoft vice president Joseph Sirosh.  Amazon, in November, introduced similar tools. Rekognition tells users what's in an image, Polly converts text to human-like speech and Lex – based on the company's popular Alexa service – uses speech and text recognition for building conversational bots. It plans more this year.  Chris Nicholson, CEO of AI company Skymind Inc., isn’t sure how large the market really is for AI in the cloud. The massive data sets some companies want to use are still mostly stored in house and it's expensive and time-consuming to move them to the cloud. It’s easier to bring the AI algorithms to the data than the other way round, he said.   Amazon's Wood disagrees, noting healthy demand for the company's Snowball appliance for transferring large amounts of information to its data centers. Interest was so high that in November Amazon introduced an 18-wheeler truck called Snowmobile that can move 100 petabytes of data.  Microsoft's Sirosh said the cloud can be powerful for companies that don't want to invest in the processing power to crunch the data needed for AI-based apps.   Take Norwegian power company eSmart Systems AS, which developed drones that photograph power lines. The company wrote its own algorithm to scan the images for locations that need repair. But it rents the massive computing power needed to run the software from Microsoft's Azure cloud service, CEO Knut Johansen said.   As the market grows and competition intensifies, each vendor will play to their strengths.   ”Google has the most credibility based on tools they have; Microsoft is the one that will actually be able to convince the enterprises to do it; and Amazon has the advantage in that most corporate data in the cloud is in AWS,” said Algorithmia's Oppenheimer. “It's anybody's game.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Report: New tourism tax could hurt hotel operators Global chip boom brightens outlook for sector ‘KL has long way to go‘ Of tinkerers, innovators and creators Over 1,000 trees along DASH highway to be felled Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Others Also Read Dortmund and Monaco prepare for quarter-final goalfest Abundant opportunities await in oil palm sector Kampung Boyan retention pond to be open by mid-year advertisement Latest News British lender Wonga warns customers of personal data hack US net neutrality advocates blast Ajit Pai effort to reverse rules Twitter CEO forgoes compensation; long-time board member to leave Laptop ban spurred by terror concern raises warning of fire risk Softbank-backed Ola ramps up electric vehicles push in India Most Viewed in Tech How strong is your password?

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Banks fight back against Venmo with own apps print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 3025033 false Apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other. (Dreamstime/TNS) Click here to enlarge image Banks fight back against Venmo with own apps By James Rufus Koren / Los Angeles Times Published Apr 9, 2017 at 12:02AM Odds are, you’ve at least heard of Venmo, but there’s also a good chance you haven’t used the mobile app or anything else like it to send money to family or friends. But that’s likely to change over the next few years, as banks, payment companies and even the likes of Google and Facebook push so-called peer-to-peer, or p2p, payment systems — a medium of exchange with revolutionary potential. The apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other, and they even could make inroads at the cash register and with businesses that send refunds and other payments to their customers. These systems will get a boost later this year when a coalition of the nation’s biggest banks roll out Zelle, a mobile and online money-transfer network that will let any customer of nearly every U.S. bank send money to customers of any other bank using only a phone number or email address. Analysts say the bank-led system — and the related marketing push — should bring online and mobile peer-to-peer payments to a larger audience. Even competitors, notably the popular money transfer app Venmo, say the Zelle rollout could boost their fortunes by making digital-money transfers more mainstream. “We don’t see it as a winner-take-all scenario,” said Josh Criscoe, a spokesman for Venmo owner PayPal. “We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash.” Online and mobile peer-to-peer payment systems have grown rapidly over the last few years, and analysts expect that to continue. In a report published in March, finance industry research firm Aite Group estimated Americans made about $147 billion in digital p2p transfers last year, up from $100 billion the year before. Those are big numbers, to be sure, but last year’s sum still only accounted for about 12 percent of the more than $1.2 trillion that Americans paid each other that year, mostly in cash. That means there’s still plenty of growth ahead, said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group. In her report, she estimated the volume of digital p2p payments will more than double by 2020, topping $316 billion. “Not that many consumers are using mobile payments yet,” Baker said, noting that though these payments are more common among young consumers in big coastal cities, they’re not so ubiquitous elsewhere. “I’m a Gen X person, and I live in Denver — I hadn’t heard of Venmo until 2015,” she said. There are plenty of players in the p2p game. Square Inc., the payments company behind the tiny white credit-card reader that plugs into a smartphone, has a p2p service of its own, Square Cash, which launched in 2013. Following the geometric theme, there’s also Circle, a Boston firm that started the same year and specializes in cross-border p2p transfers in dollars, euros and British pounds. Facebook and Google, too, allow users to send money to friends. Google has Google Wallet, which started as a mobile wallet app but became a p2p payment tool in 2015, and Facebook users have been able to send money through Facebook Messenger since 2015. Square, Google and Facebook don’t report the volume of payments made through their p2p systems, but Facebook in regulatory filings has said only “a relatively small percentage” of its users have used the payments feature. Venmo is arguably the biggest name in peer-to-peer transfers. It even has the coveted status, like Google, Uber and a few others, of becoming a verb — as in “Venmo me.” Founded in 2009, the company was acquired in 2012 by payment services provider Braintree, which was acquired the following year by online payments giant PayPal — which offers p2p payments under its own name, too. But the biggest players in the market are still the banks. Last year, Venmo users transferred $17.6 billion. That’s more than double the volume from 2015, but it’s also much less than the $28 billion transferred in 2016 through QuickPay, JPMorgan Chase’s peer-to-peer payment system. And that’s just one bank. Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other major financial institutions have had their own p2p transfer programs for years, though it can sometimes be clunky for bank customers to send money to people with accounts at other financial institutions. Aite Group estimates that of all the digital p2p transfers Americans made last year, nonbank systems such as Venmo accounted for only about 17 percent of that. Banks accounted for the rest, though much of that likely was made through banks’ websites, not mobile apps, and much of it was money transferred between customers of the same bank. In part, that’s a statement about who uses different systems, and what they are used for. Venmo and other nonbank systems are accessed about twice as often as bank systems, but for much smaller transactions, according to Aite Group. The average money transfer on a nonbank system is $135; the average for bank systems is $1,359, according to the report. That might suggest parents sending money to a student for college tuition, for instance, might be more likely to transfer money through a bank, while students are much more likely to split a restaurant bill or bar tab using Venmo. The payment app is also a social network in its own right, with users sending messages to friends when they transfer money — a feature Venmo pioneered. Those messages shed light on what’s behind each transaction and indicate Venmo is most often used among friends over food and drink, said Criscoe, the Venmo spokesman. “Pizza is the No. 1 emoji on Venmo; beer is a close follow,” he said, adding that other messages suggest users are splitting bigger-ticket items, too, such as rent. Though Venmo and other nonbank payment systems are still a small part of the p2p market, banks want to make sure they keep their place in the financial order and keep their customers. This summer, Early Warning, a company owned by some of the nation’s largest banks, will release Zelle, a payment system built to compete with Venmo and others — and, banks hope, to make digital p2p payments more mainstream. Along with the release, Early Warning will kick off a marketing campaign showing not only how Zelle works but how it might be used. Lou Anne Alexander, president of Early Warning’s payments group, said the focus will be on appealing to older consumers who might not have tried p2p payments. “We’re trying to take (p2p) from millennials to the mainstream — customers might use a product like this,” Alexander said. “That might be managing contributions to the high school marching band or it might be renting a home on the beach with friends or family.” 16932843 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

The ability to create shopping lists is one such feature. You can just tell Google Assistant the item that you want on your shopping list and it will add that to the list. Previously, the lists were stored in Google Keep but this is going to change soon. Shopping lists made via the Google Assistant will no longer be said in Google Keep starting April 10th. A support page on Google’s website reveals that shopping lists created in Google Assistant will be moved from Google Keep to the Google Home and Express apps. This will also be true for all new lists created after the aforementioned date. It makes more sense to store the lists in the Google Home and Express apps given that they will enable users in supported markets to easily order and track delivery of the items on their list. Those who don’t want to have their lists migrated automatically from Keep after April 10th, they should delete them manually from Keep. After April 10th, items added to shopping lists using Google Assistant will only be available for viewing in the Express and Home apps. Tap on the list icon to bring them up. Filed in Gadgets.

Pretty soon, Google followed with its Home (not Gnome) and Google Assistant and soon, Microsoft will do likewise with Cortana. That device has already been teased before to bear Harman Kardon’s brand but very little else. Now some more details are falling into place courtesy of leaks, including a rather unusual but still totally generic name: Invoke. Exact hardware details of these speakers are still anyone’s guess, other than possibly premium audio components worthy of the Harman Kardon name. What’s new, aside from the name, are details about the software that will come the speakers. Of course, there’s Cortana, will be voiced-controlled and can do anything its desktop and smartphone counterparts can. The speaker itself, however, will be able to do more. For one, it will supposedly have built-in Skype integration, which is going to be a big thing in these smart speaker wars. Amazon and Google have been rumored to be planning to add voice call capabilities to their speakers. While not exactly the same, Skype integration could still give Invoke an edge over the competition. Harman Kardon Invoke will also have an amount of support for third-party music streaming services, including Hear Radio and, of course, Microsoft’s own Groove Music. The speakers won’t require a Windows 10 desktop and can be paired with an Android, iOS, or even Windows Mobile device. While the Invoke speaker might indeed sound competitive, it might lose out on the price tag. Harman Kardon Equipment aren’t exactly known for being affordable. Buyers, however, might be treated to a premium-sounding and premium-looking piece of tech, one that even has a pulsating halo light that mimics Cortana’s appearance on desktops and mobile.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | April 5, 2017 -- 23:15 GMT (16:15 PDT) | Topic: Networking Google announced Wednesday that it's investing in a new subsea cable system that will run between Australia and Asia. The investment is Google's latest move to strengthen its ties to the APAC region. Called Indigo, the cable will connect Perth, Sydney, and Singapore, with a branch to Jakarta. To build the cable, Google is partnering with AARNet, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel, SubPartners and Telstra, while Alcatel Submarine Networks will construct the cable. Span approximately 9,000km, it's expected to be completed by mid-2019. Indigo will initially have two fiber pairs with a design capacity of around 18 terabits per second -- enough capacity for people in Singapore and Sydney to join 8 million simultaneous high-definition Google Hangout video conference calls. Indigo is the latest effort to build out subsea cable capacity across the Asia-Pacific region, as data usage grows there. Google has already invested in four other submarine cables in the region, including the FASTER and PLCN cables. Google considers its network infrastructure a key part of its pitch to potential Google Cloud Platform (GCP) customers, boasting the largest network backbone of any public cloud provider. In November, GCP opened its Tokyo region, and it has plans to open regions in Singapore and Sydney this year.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest 5 ways AI is already making a difference in society Kerry Liu, Rubikloud April 9, 2017 7:17 PM Tags: ai, bots, chatbots, machine learning, Rubikloud Image Credit: Shutterstock.com / Melpomene By now, everyone and their grandparents are talking about machine learning and AI. Unfortunately, lately, many people have been questioning whether all this effort is worth it and some are worried about future job losses. Just yesterday at an event, someone asked me, “The world invested so much money into image recognition just so we could recognize a cat. What’s the point?” My response was, “Well, a machine recognizing a cat is the first step towards a machine detecting and recognizing a tumor.” If you cut through the hype and use a strategic goal, machine learning can offer real-world value. The increased ease, speed, and functionality it offers create avenues for use cases across the spectrum of industries that rely heavily on data. For retail businesses, it provides an opportunity to improve and customize the customer experience. Let’s take a look at five examples that are worth noting. Given that one of the world’s most prolific scientific minds on AI just resigned from Baidu to focus on his next project that will “benefit the greater good,” I felt this was timely. 1. Machine learning helping the disabled Much like the closed-captioning we’ve seen on TV, machine learning now makes it possible to identify specific elements from YouTube videos. New algorithms can visualize sound effects like applause, laughter, and music. This is a huge development for the versatility of the platform, as they look to become more accessible. Google’s new video intelligence API made big news recently at Google Cloud Next, and uses extremely high-tech models to identify specific elements in video. This can include things as descriptive as a smile, water, a species of animal, etc. Machine learning makes both of these possible and opens the door for many new possibilities for making online content easier to access for the disabled. Student and startup employee Austin Lebetkin lives with autism spectrum disorder. He thinks that machine learning can open the door for the disabled to use and interact with digital content in many of the same ways that others do. Considering the amount of new content being developed that emphasizes audio-visual interactivity, this is a huge breakthrough for the disabled. 2. Suicide prevention After some horrific events involving the live-streaming of suicides, Facebook garnered a considerable amount of negative feedback. To combat this, they’ve decided to implement machine learning capabilities. Machine learning will now “build predictive models to tailor interventions earlier”. It comes at the right time, considering an increase in suicide rates over the past couple of years. With appropriate data mining, Facebook and others will be able to identify suicidal tendencies earlier online and be quicker to intervene. 3. Wearable medical devices A company called Geneia is using machine learning to increase data efficiency and improve insights. By better utilizing their data, Geneia is able to more improve medical status predictions at a much quicker rate. This means responses arrive earlier and at a higher quality of care. Clinical assessments and lab values used in the past are much less speedy and efficient. As a result, there’s a very real possibility that the sick or elderly can live more comfortably at home while avoiding the risk involved in being away from medical facilities. 4. Student growth measures for success Anyone who’s studied in a public classroom knows that there are a number of different learning styles. Not everyone’s brain functions the same and everyone has different needs to be met. Thanks to machine learning, this is now much easier to make possible. Use of student-level projections allows for a standardized measure of success so that each student can learn and progress according to their own characteristics. This creates a much higher chance for a student to respond positively, and ultimately a better chance for success. 5. Machine learning identifying skin cancer Stanford researchers have been working very hard on this one. They’ve created a machine learning algorithm that uses a massive image database to make skin cancer diagnoses. Using the more recent developments combining deep learning with visual identification, the algorithm is aimed at replacing the initial observation step of skin cancer diagnosis. This will make the process easier and more efficient for both the patient and doctor. Though the algorithm currently exists on a computer, there’s a plan in place to expand to mobile very soon. When you look at some of these cases, it’s clear that there’s a lot more at stake when we talk about the value of machine learning. Most of the buzzworthy tech news falls short of providing a sense of the huge possibilities at stake.

There's a fair bit to like about the Google Pixel, the first smartphone designed in-house by the company behind Android. It was the packing Android 7.0 Nougat and the Google Assistant from day one, so it certainly act like a high-end handset, plus it has an amazing main camera. Unfortunately, when put against the top of the top-tier Android competition, the Pixel falls short in some key ways – much like last year's LG G5 did. Although a rather capable and intriguing phone on its own, the G5's focus on modular accessories ultimately didn't attract a lot of attention from flagship buyers. Luckily, LG is well back on track with the G6, an appealing slab of top-end tech with a focus on a stunning, extra-tall screen with minimal bezel.  The G6 overcame the ghost of last year's G5, but can it also outrank the Google Pixel? Here's how it all shakes out. DESIGN: GOTTA BE G6 It's obvious: the Google Pixel and Pixel XL look just like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (and 6/6s and 6/6s Plus) at a glance, but as is often the case, the imitation doesn't quite live up to the original. Nor does it really compare to some of the more alluring Android handsets out there today, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and OnePlus 3T. The glass cutout accent on the back is kind of neat, while the Very Blue colour choice is certainly eye-catching, but the big bezels and antenna lines don't stack up against the top Androids today. And it's not even water-resistant. C'mon, Google. Luckily, we feel a lot more strongly about the LG G6. Just look at the front of it: the screen takes up more than 80% of the face, with minimal bezel all around to accentuate what you're looking at and playing. And the little rounded edges on the screen are a nice touch, as well. All told, the design seems ultra-refined and premium, with glass on both sides, high tensile metal holding it all together, IP68 water resistance, and a well-placed fingerprint sensor on the back. It's a beautiful-looking phone, not to mention a big step up from the G5. Winner: LG G6 SCREEN: BIG AND BOLD One of the drawbacks of the standard Google Pixel was its insistence on a 1080p display, despite competing against flagships with Quad HD panels. Granted, the Pixel's 5in screen is still sharper than the standard iPhone 7, but it's a step down from the Samsung Galaxy S7 and even the LG G5. The Pixel XL, however, packs a 5.5in Quad HD screen for the extra cash. Like the G5 last year, the LG G6 has its own Quad HD screen – but this isn't the same panel. For one thing, it's taller: LG opted for an uncommon 18:9 aspect ratio for the phone, which means the screen's a little wider than traditional widescreen (16:9) in landscape mode. Luckily, LG has modes that re-render content to fit the screen without obvious stretching. It's not just a taller screen, either. The 5.7in IPS display also has a wider colour gamut to support high dynamic range (HDR), which delivers more contrast between bright and dark colours and will make supported content absolutely pop on the thing. Netflix will add HDR support to its Android app, which means we'll be able to experience Iron Fist and House of Cards at their best even when on the go. That's awesome, and it totally seals the deal on LG having the better panel here. Winner: LG G6 POWER: ALL THE SAME It's a wash here: the Pixel just launched a few months back, and features Qualcomm's currently top-of-the-line Snapdragon 821 chip, which runs about 10% faster than the previous 820. It also has 4GB RAM within. And the LG G6? That's right: a Snapdragon 821 with 4GB RAM alongside. Both also run Android Nougat with the Google Assistant, and yes, both are incredibly swift and capable of handling just about anything you throw at it. Yes, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is right around the corner with the speedier Exynos 8895 or Snapdragon 835 within (depending on where you live), but the Snapdragon 821 will remain plenty fast even when that hits stores. In any case, there's no big difference in performance for this particular matchup, given the essentially identical internals. Winner: Draw CAMERA: PIXEL PACKS A PUNCH If there's one thing we can say in absolute praise for the Pixel and Pixel XL, without any reservation whatsoever, it's that both of Google's phones have fantastic back cameras. It's the same 12.3 megapixel shooter on both, in fact, and it's right up there with the Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 Plus as the best around. During our testing, we found the Pixel to take excellent snaps with the HDR+ mode engaged, and the blend of phase detection and laser autofocus produced sharp low-light results. That's true even without optical image stabilisation, although it's also worth noting that the electronic video stabilisation here is fabulous. The G5's dual back cameras were pretty stellar aside from the fact that one was 16MP and the other 8MP, which meant your field of vision (FOV) choice also came with a quality choice. The G6 keeps the duo but levels them out at 13MP apiece, meaning you'll see fantastic results at both 71° (standard) and 125° (wide angle) with strong lighting. And it uses solely phase detection autofocus, switching from last year's laser tech. In low light, the wide-angle lens tends to be a bit blurrier, however, due to the lack of optical image stabilisation in only that lens. Both the Pixel and G6 will give you excellent shots most of the time, but side by side, we have to give the nod to the Pixel here. We see better detail, improved exposure due to multi-image processing, more light variance in HDR mode, and more clarity overall. The Pixel is the clear choice for on-the-go photographers who fuss over the little details. And really, you should at these prices. Winner: Google Pixel BATTERY LIFE AND PERKS: THE LG EDGE Both the LG G6 and Google Pixel are built to give you a solid day's usage on a full battery charge, but probably little more. The G6 has a 3,300mAh cell within, albeit with a larger and higher-resolution screen, while the Pixel packs 2,750mAh. In both cases, a full day was typically resonable with regular usage, but if you're playing heavy-duty or GPS-enabled games or streaming a lot of media, you might need a top-up before bedtime. When it comes to extra highlights, the Pixel's biggest is surely Google Daydream. Both Pixel phones support Google's own mobile VR platform, which has seen a steady stream of fresh content released since the debut, even if there's not quite as much as on Samsung's Gear VR just yet. The Pixel is sold in 32GB and 128GB varieties, however it doesn't have microSD support for expandable storage, and as mentioned before, it also lacks water resistance. For an Android flagship released in late 2016, both omissions are pretty significant and unfortunate. The LG G6 covers both of those bits, with a microSD slot (to expand out from its 32GB internal stash) as well as IP68 water and dust resistance. However, so far, LG hasn't said anything about any kind of virtual reality support for the device. The LG 360 VR headset for the LG G5 wasn't very good, but maybe LG has something more refined or enticing in the works for down the line. Winner: LG G6 OVERALL: LG LOOKS GOOD The Google Pixel already seemed to fall a little short of the competition when it debuted last autumn. Despite being Google's own model of how an Android phone should look and act, it only seemed to nail the latter part – given the price, looking and feeling like an iPhone knockoff didn't really inspire a lot of excitement. The Pixel XL was the better pick of the bunch, especially with that Quad HD display, but the added cost was pretty daunting. Both are very good devices in an era of brilliant flagships. And the LG G6 is much, much closer to that level of brilliance. Ditching last year's modular phase was for the best here, as the G6 instead focuses on delivering strong tech and pristine looks within a durable, reliable handset. It's impressively refined, seriously fast, and has one of the best smartphone screens ever seen. The Pixel matches the LG G6 on performance and takes the advantage on camera quality, but as a complete package, LG has the win here - even with the premium over Google's base handset.

Adverts for major brands including Amazon, Microsoft, Deliveroo and Guess are being run alongside YouTube videos of people cutting themselves with razor blades, and talking about self-mutilation, a Daily Mail investigation has found. Meanwhile, advertising for Benefit cosmetics, Exodus travel, Holiday Autos, Right Casino and the Charities Aid Foundation have been found on videos of skeletal women, encouraging viewers to starve themselves. Adverts for major brands including Amazon, Microsoft, Deliveroo and Guess are being run alongside YouTube videos of people cutting themselves with razor blades (file photo)  Google profits from the adverts itself, but also hands a cut of the cash directly to the people who posted the videos – including youngsters who slice themselves with razor blades in front of the camera. The technology giant said that it was careful about how it handled the shocking material. A spokesman said: ‘Videos which encourage people to commit harmful or dangerous acts are against our policies and we remove them when flagged. ‘We also know that many people come to YouTube for emotional support and continually try to strike the right balance to enable people to talk honestly about the issues they’ve faced and provide support.

Share this article Share ‘We are, however, careful to age-restrict material that might not be suitable for younger users.’ However, many of the videos seen by the Mail go considerably further than emotional support. Some of the self-harm videos are horrendously bloody films of people slowly slicing their arms in front of the camera with razor blades. One user has published a series of shocking posts about performing ‘DIY’ surgery with knives, toenail clippers and scissors. The videos are not visually graphic, but in one, she claims to have performed a tummy tuck on herself using a carpet knife and scissors. Google profits from the adverts itself, but also hands a cut of the cash directly to the people who posted the videos Adverts for Amazon, Microsoft, Deliveroo and Guess run alongside the posts. Meanwhile, adverts for the Charities Aid Foundation were shown on a video slideshow of skeletal women, tagged ‘thinspo’ – a term used by eating disorder sufferers to describe what they see as motivational pictures of very thin women. The video is styled like a magazine shoot – but the women have jutting bones and rib cages. The charity pulled its adverts from YouTube as soon as the Mail alerted it to the problem. A spokesman said: ‘The Charities Aid Foundation would like to thank the Daily Mail for bringing this case to our attention.’ Google places adverts using automated technology rather than human judgment, handing the people who post the content a cut of the revenues. ... AND IT WON'T AXE FILMS BY FANATICS Google is under fire from MPs, including Yvette Cooper, for refusing to take down extremist videos from its YouTube service that have been identified using artificial intelligence  Google is under fire from MPs for refusing to take down extremist videos from its YouTube service that have been identified using artificial intelligence. The company says that new AI technology allows it to seek out hate-filled videos that might encourage terror outrages. However, rather than using the system to protect the public, it is accused of using to protect its commercial interests. Google is reported to be using the system simply to ensure that household name brands are not embarrassed by their adverts being placed alongside the videos. Chief business officer Philipp Schindler said that by using the AI tools and ‘a lot more people’ it had flagged five times as many videos as ‘non-safe’ in the past two weeks. However, Google told The Times that the tools would be used only ‘to identify content that may be inappropriate for advertisers’. It said videos would be checked by its reviewers only after they are flagged by users. Commons home affairs select committee chairman Yvette Cooper said: ‘They shouldn’t just be using it to help big companies be confident about where their advertising revenues are going – they should also be using it to identify illegal or dangerous content that shouldn’t be on YouTube at all.’ They receive up to £6.15 for every 1,000 views, and many videos are watched millions of times – although that pales in comparison with Google’s own share of the income. Mental health charities condemned Google for profiting from the videos, which may trigger relapses in sufferers. Stephen Buckley, of mental health charity Mind, said: ‘It is vital to recognise the huge danger created by any site or social media trend that promotes or glamorises self-harm, suicide or eating disorders. ‘These are incredibly serious problems. Social media sites should take their responsibilities seriously and do what they can to help people protect themselves from dangerous content.’ Share or comment on this article e-mail 11 shares Most watched News videos Indian news anchor bravely reports her own husband's death Moment suspected suicide bomber appears to attack Egyptian church Explosion hits Egypt church during LIVE broadcast of worshippers Shocking video shows Colorado cop body slamming sorority girl ABC news anchor caught day dreaming in studio Dizzy video showcases glass-bottomed swimming pool 40 stories high Man gets smacked in the face by pigeon while on rollercoaster I Am Supported is a platform dedicated to helping the homeless Bloodstained Egyptian church moments after fatal bombing Terrified people flee scene of Stockholm truck attack Panicked shoppers pile into store as deadly truck chases them Egypt in shock as explosion kills dozens during morning prayer Moment a TV news presenter finds out her husband has died...

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 894.88 -3.40 -0.38% Salesforce.com Inc CRM ▼ 84.38 -0.62 -0.73% eBay Inc EBAY ▼ 33.91 -0.25 -0.73% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GSPRA ▼ 23.42 -0.24 -1.01% A little while later, Marty Chavez, who is about to become the bank's chief financial officer, received an unexpected email. "Hey Marty, I'd like to come over to your office to introduce myself," it said. It was from Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet. "We've been talking ever since about the similarities in the businesses," Chavez told a group of computer scientists earlier this year about the message. "Some of the similarities are aspirational, I have to emphasize that, and some are there right now." The comments shine a light on how Goldman Sachs' leadership see its future. It's possibly the future of all of Wall Street — because where Goldman Sachs goes, the Street often follows. It goes beyond the automation that has been creeping across trading floors for years and is now being applied to investment banking, a business that had been considered much less vulnerable to automation. Instead, Chavez's comments establish a more radical vision for Goldman Sachs and set out how Silicon Valley giants are inspiring that change. And yes, people will lose their jobs if this is how it goes. 'The fundamental truth of Goldman Sachs' Chavez was speaking at the Harvard Institute for Applied Computational Science in January. About a month ago, a video of the talk was made public on YouTube, and it has since been viewed only about 200 times. In it, Chavez said, "Goldman is for risk what Google is for search." Here's how Chavez described Google in his presentation: "Google produces software services, and those software services aggregate the attention of billions of people, and then Google sells the attention of billions of people to advertisers." And here's how he described Goldman Sachs: "A client has a risk they don't want or wants a risk they don't have, and we make it happen for them. This is the fundamental truth of Goldman Sachs. If the clients stop calling and talking to us about risks they have but don't want or want but don't have, then we have no business whatsoever." With that in mind, Goldman Sachs has built what it calls Data Lake, pulling in information on transactions, markets, and investment research, as well as insights from emails, voice calls, and instant messages. The bank is putting all that data in the same place and applying machine learning. The idea is to guide employees on who to call and when.© Provided by Business Insider Inc   "What really makes us valuable is the immense amount of data that we have," Chavez said. "In this job of inspiring our clients to call us because they have risks they don't want or want risks they don't have, there is incredible information content, and using that for the benefit of the clients to get a better result is what we're up to." The vision set out by Chavez goes further than better utilizing data for internal needs, however. He said: "Imagine if Google had gone a slightly different route and they said, 'Every time somebody wants to do a search, they pick up the phone, call their Google salesperson, read the search terms to the Google salesperson, who types them into the internal Google search engine, gets the results, and then reads them back over the phone.' "That is not the route Google took. Unfortunately, that is a pretty good description of how Wall Street works." In other words, the first step is amassing and analyzing the data, and the next step is putting the data into the hands of clients. Chavez also included this slide in his presentation showing Goldman Sachs' current approach, multiple data owners sending data to multiple clients: © Provided by Business Insider Inc   The new plan, in contrast, has one data services hub, which draws data from owners (exchanges, vendors, and Goldman's transactions) into one location then disburses it to clients. It's a model based on APIs, which are the standard way for computer programs to "talk" to one another without human intervention. When you use your Facebook account to log in to Spotify, that's Spotify talking to the Facebook login API. Famously, Jeff Bezos mandated several years ago that the only way Amazon teams could integrate their products would be via API, in a bid to increase the efficiency and speed at which programmers can build new services. In his presentation, Chavez highlighted revenues from APIs at Salesforce, eBay, and Expedia. This model is based on taking in data, pushing it through analytics engines, then making it available to internal and external clients through the Goldman Sachs digital platform that Chavez has championed. "Historically, the API has been human beings talking to other human beings over the telephone, and all the tools, the content, the analytics is on the internal platform only," Chavez said. "We are shifting this radically and shifting this fast, and we're packaging everything we do, and actually, we're redesigning the whole company, around APIs."© Provided by Business Insider Inc   That model has a few consequences. First, if you work on or have friends on Wall Street, you likely know someone whose job it is to play the equivalent of the Google salesperson in Chavez's example. This API-driven approach does not bode well for that person. Second, it positions Goldman Sachs as a kind of information-technology company. "We're turning all of the verbs, all of the activities at Goldman Sachs, into APIs," Chavez said. "One of the things we're insisting on is a very high standard of lovely and impeccable documentation for these APIs, because we're opening up the vertical monolith which used to have only one API point, which was human beings on the phone."

Tech insiders on why you should care Silicon Valley is engineering your phone, apps and social media to get you hooked, says a former Google product manager. Anderson Cooper reports 2017 Apr 09 Correspondent Anderson Cooper Comments Facebook Twitter Stumble The following script is from “Brain Hacking,” which aired on April 9, 2017. Anderson Cooper is the correspondent. Guy Campanile, producer. Have you ever wondered if all those people you see staring intently at their smartphones -- nearly everywhere, and at all times -- are addicted to them? According to a former Google product manager you are about to hear from, Silicon Valley is engineering your phone, apps and social media to get you hooked. He is one of the few tech insiders to publicly acknowledge that the companies responsible for programming your phones are working hard to get you and your family to feel the need to check in constantly. Some programmers call it “brain hacking” and the tech world would probably prefer you didn’t hear about it. But Tristan Harris openly questions the long-term consequences of it all and we think it’s worth putting down your phone to listen. Tristan Harris, a former Google product manager CBS News Tristan Harris: This thing is a slot machine. Anderson Cooper: How is that a slot machine? Tristan Harris: Well every time I check my phone, I’m playing the slot machine to see, “What did I get?” This is one way to hijack people’s minds and create a habit, to form a habit. What you do is you make it so when someone pulls a lever, sometimes they get a reward, an exciting reward. And it turns out that this design technique can be embedded inside of all these products. The rewards Harris is talking about are a big part of what makes smartphones so appealing. The chance of getting likes on Facebook and Instagram. Cute emojis in text messages. And new followers on Twitter. Tristan Harris: There’s a whole playbook of techniques that get used to get you using the product for as long as possible. Anderson Cooper: What kind of techniques are used? “...every time I check my phone, I’m playing the slot machine to see, ‘What did I get?’ This is one way to hijack people’s minds and create a habit, to form a habit.” Tristan Harris Tristan Harris: Tristan Harris: So Snapchat’s the most popular messaging service for teenagers. And they invented this feature called “streaks,” which shows the number of days in a row that you’ve sent a message back and forth with someone. So now you could say, “Well, what’s the big deal here?” Well, the problem is that kids feel like, “Well, now I don’t want to lose my streak.” But it turns out that kids actually when they go on vacation are so stressed about their streak that they actually give their password to, like, five other kids to keep their streaks going on their behalf. And so you could ask when these features are being designed, are they designed to most help people live their life? Or are they being designed because they’re best at hooking people into using the product? Anderson Cooper: Is Silicon Valley programming apps or are they programming people? Tristan Harris: Inadvertently, whether they want to or not, they are shaping the thoughts and feelings and actions of people. They are programming people. There’s always this narrative that technology’s neutral. And it’s up to us to choose how we use it. This is just not true. Anderson Cooper: Technology’s not neutral? Tristan Harris: It’s not neutral. They want you to use it in particular ways and for long periods of time. Because that’s how they make their money. It’s rare for a tech insider to be so blunt, but Tristan Harris believes someone needs to be. A few years ago he was living the Silicon Valley dream. He dropped out of a master’s program at Stanford University to start a software company. Four years later Google bought him out and hired him as a product manager. It was while working there he started to feel overwhelmed. Tristan Harris: Honestly, I was just bombarded in email and calendar invitations and just the overload of what it’s like to work at a place like Google. And I was asking, “When is all of this adding up to, like, an actual benefit to my life?” And I ended up making this presentation. It was kind of a manifesto. And it basically said, you know, “Look, never before in history have a handful of people at a handful of technology companies shaped how a billion people think and feel every day with the choices they make about these screens.” “Inadvertently, whether they want to or not, they are shaping the thoughts and feelings and actions of people. They are programming people.” Tristan Harris His 144-page presentation argued that the constant distractions of apps and emails are “weakening our relationships to each other,” and “destroying our kids ability to focus.” It was widely read inside Google, and caught the eye of one of the founders Larry Page. But Harris told us it didn’t lead to any changes and after three years he quit. Tristan Harris: And it’s not because anyone is evil or has bad intentions. It’s because the game is getting attention at all costs. And the problem is it becomes this race to the bottom of the brainstem, where if I go lower on the brainstem to get you, you know, using my product, I win. But it doesn’t end up in the world we want to live in. We don’t end up feeling good about how we’re using all this stuff. Play Video 60 Minutes Overtime When smartphones become a teen's drug of choice Anderson Cooper speaks with two teens in a treatment center in Malibu who realized: It's their phone they're hooked on. Anderson Cooper: You call this a “race to the bottom of the brain stem.” It’s a race to the most primitive emotions we have? Fear, anxiety, loneliness, all these things? Tristan Harris: Absolutely. And that’s again because in the race for attention I have to do whatever works. Tristan Harris: It absolutely wants one thing, which is your attention. Now he travels the country trying to convince programmers and anyone else who will listen that the business model of tech companies needs to change. He wants products designed to make the best use of our time not just grab our attention. Play Video 60 Minutes Overtime Defining your day by "what pops up on the screen" 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper talks about his own struggle with smartphone overuse--and why your phone doesn't love you as much as you love it. Anderson Cooper: Do you think parents understand the complexities of what their kids are dealing with, when they’re dealing with their phone, dealing with apps and social media? Tristan Harris: No. And I think this is really important. Because there’s a narrative that, “Oh, I guess they’re just doing this like we used to gossip on the phone, but what this misses is that your telephone in the 1970s didn’t have a thousand engineers on the other side of the telephone who were redesigning it to work with other telephones and then updating the way your telephone worked every day to be more and more persuasive. That was not true in the 1970s. Anderson Cooper: How many Silicon Valley insiders are there speaking out like you are? Tristan Harris: Not that many. We reached out to the biggest tech firms but none would speak on the record and some didn’t even return our phone call.  Most tech companies say their priority is improving user experience, something they call “engagement.”  But they remain secretive about what they do to keep people glued to their screens.  So we went to Venice, California, where the body builders on the beach are being muscled out by small companies that specialize in what Ramsay Brown calls “brain hacking.” Anderson Cooper speaks with Ramsay Brown, the cofounder of Dopamine Labs CBS News Ramsay Brown: A computer programmer who now understands how the brain works knows how to write code that will get the brain to do certain things. Ramsay Brown studied neuroscience before co-founding Dopamine Labs, a start-up crammed into a garage. The company is named after the dopamine molecule in our brains that aids in the creation of desire and pleasure. Brown and his colleagues write computer code for apps used by fitness companies and financial firms. The programs are designed to provoke a neurological response. “A computer programmer who now understands how the brain works knows how to write code that will get the brain to do certain things.” Ramsay Brown Anderson Cooper: You’re trying to figure out how to get people coming back to use the screen? Ramsay Brown: When should I make you feel a little extra awesome to get you to come back into the app longer? Ramsay Brown CBS News The computer code he creates finds the best moment to give you one of those rewards, which have no actual value, but Brown says trigger your brain to make you want more. For example, on Instagram, he told us sometimes those likes come in a sudden rush. Ramsay Brown: They’re holding some of them back for you to let you know later in a big burst. Like, hey, here’s the 30 likes we didn’t mention from a little while ago. Why that moment-- Anderson Cooper: So all of a sudden you get a big burst of likes? Ramsay Brown: Yeah, but why that moment? There’s some algorithm somewhere that predicted, hey, for this user right now who is experimental subject 79B3 in experiment 231, we think we can see an improvement in his behavior if you give it to him in this burst instead of that burst. When Brown says “experiments,” he’s talking generally about the millions of computer calculations being used every moment by his company and others use to constantly tweak your online experience and make you come back for more. Ramsay Brown: You’re part of a controlled set of experiments that are happening in real time across you and millions of other people. Anderson Cooper: We’re guinea pigs? Ramsay Brown: You’re guinea pigs. You are guinea pigs in the box pushing the button and sometimes getting the likes. And they’re doing this to keep you in there. The longer we look at our screens, the more data companies collect about us, and the more ads we see. Ad spending on social media has doubled in just two years to more than $31 billion. Ramsay Brown: You don’t pay for Facebook. Advertisers pay for Facebook. You get to use it for free because your eyeballs are what’s being sold there. Anderson Cooper: That’s an interesting way to look at it, that you’re not the customer for Facebook. “You don’t pay for Facebook. Advertisers pay for Facebook. You get to use it for free because your eyeballs are what’s being sold there.” Ramsay Brown Ramsay Brown: You’re not the customer. You don’t sign a check to Facebook. But Coca-Cola does. Brown says there’s a reason texts and Facebook use a continuous scroll, because it’s a proven way to keep you searching longer. Ramsay Brown: You spend half your time on Facebook just scrolling to find one good piece worth looking at. It’s happening because they are engineered to become addictive. Anderson Cooper: You’re almost saying it like there’s an addiction code. Ramsay Brown: Yeah, that is the case. That since we’ve figured out, to some extent, how these pieces of the brain that handle addiction are working, people have figured out how to juice them further and how to bake that information into apps. Larry Rosen: Dinner table could be a technology-free zone. While Brown is tapping into the power of dopamine, psychologist Larry Rosen and his team at California State University Dominguez Hills are researching the effect technology has on our anxiety levels. Larry Rosen: We’re looking at the impact of technology through the brain. Rosen told us when you put your phone down – your brain signals your adrenal gland to produce a burst of a hormone called, cortisol, which has an evolutionary purpose. Cortisol triggers a fight-or-flight response to danger. Anderson Cooper: How does cortisol relate to a mobile device, a phone? Larry Rosen: What we find is the typical person checks their phone every 15 minutes or less and half of the time they check their phone there is no alert, no notification. It’s coming from inside their head telling them, “Gee, I haven’t check in Facebook in a while. I haven’t checked on this Twitter feed for a while. I wonder if somebody commented on my Instagram post.” That then generates cortisol and it starts to make you anxious. And eventually your goal is to get rid of that anxiety so you check in. So the same hormone that made primitive man anxious and hyperaware of his surroundings to keep him from being eaten by lions is today compelling Rosen’s students and all of us to continually peek at our phones to relieve our anxiety. Larry Rosen: When you put the phone down you don’t shut off your brain, you just put the phone down. Anderson Cooper: Can I be honest with you right now? I haven’t paid attention to what you’re saying because I just realized my phone is right down by my right foot and I haven’t checked it in, like 10 minutes. Larry Rosen: And it makes you anxious. Anderson Cooper: I’m a little anxious. A computer tracks minute changes in Anderson Cooper’s heart rate and perspiration CBS News Larry Rosen: Yes. We found out just how anxious in this experiment conducted by Rosen’s research colleague Nancy Cheever. Nancy Cheever: So the first thing I’m going to do is apply these electrodes to your fingers. While I watched a video, a computer tracked minute changes in my heart rate and perspiration. What I didn’t know was that Cheever was sending text messages to my phone which was just out of reach. Every time my text notification went off, the blue line spiked – indicating anxiety caused in part by the release of cortisol. Nancy Cheever: Oh, that one is…that’s a huge spike right there. And if you can imagine what that’s doing to your body. Every time you get a text message you probably can’t even feel it right? Because it’s such a um, it’s a small amount of arousal. Anderson Cooper: That’s fascinating. Their research suggests our phones are keeping us in a continual state of anxiety in which the only antidote – is the phone. Anderson Cooper: Is it known what the impact of all this technology use is? Larry Rosen: Absolutely not. Anderson Cooper: It’s too soon. Larry Rosen: We’re all part of this big experiment. Anderson Cooper: What is this doing to a young mind or a teenager? Larry Rosen: Well there’s some projects going on where they’re actually scanning teenager’s brains over a 20-year period and looking to see what kind of changes they’re finding. Gabe Zichermann CBS News Gabe Zichermann: Here’s the reality. Corporations and creators of content have, since the beginning of time, wanted to make their content as engaging as possible. Gabe Zichermann has worked with dozens of companies – including Apple and CBS – to make their online products more irresistible. He’s best known in Silicon Valley for his expertise in something called “gamification,” using techniques from video games to insert fun and competition into almost everything on your smartphone. Gabe Zichermann: So one of the interesting things about gamification and other engaging technologies, is at the same time as we can argue that the neuroscience is being used to create dependent behavior those same techniques are being used to get people to work out, you know, using their Fitbit. So all of these technologies, all the techniques for engagement can be used for good, or can be used for bad. “Asking technology companies, asking content creators to be less good at what they do feels like a ridiculous ask.” Gabe Zichermann Zichermann is now working on software called ‘Onward’ designed to break user’s bad habits. It will track a person’s activity and can recommend they do something else when they’re spending too much time online. Gabe Zichermann: I think creators have to be liberated to make their content as good as possible. Anderson Cooper: The idea that a tech company is not going to try to make their product as persuasive, as engaging as possible, you’re just saying that’s not gonna happen? Gabe Zichermann: Asking technology companies, asking content creators to be less good at what they do feels like a ridiculous ask. It feels impossible. And also it’s very anti-capitalistic, this isn’t the system that we live in. Ramsay Brown and his garage start-up Dopamine Labs made a habit-breaking app as well.  It’s called “Space” and it creates a 12-second delay --  what Brown calls a “moment of Zen” before any social media app launches. In January, he tried to convince Apple to sell it in their App Store. Ramsay Brown: And they rejected it from the App Store because they told us any app that would encourage people to use other apps or their iPhone less was unacceptable for distribution in the App Store. Anderson Cooper: They actually said that to you? Ramsay Brown: They said that to us. They did not want us to give out this thing that was gonna make people less stuck on their phones. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Monday, April 10, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 16687 81 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

We’re seeing more Android Nougat updates roll out, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is almost here and the LG G6 is on the way. On the other end of the spectrum, Apple’s iOS 11 update is set for an unveiling in June and we expect an iPhone 8 later this year. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus along with iOS 10 helped Apple users catch up in a number of ways, but there are still a lot of areas where Android is hands down better than the iPhone and iOS. Why Android is better than iPhone in 2017. Ultimately you need to figure out if an Android phone is better than the iPhone for your needs and your preferences, but if you are trying to decide this list of things that Android does better can help. Apple caught up to Android in many areas with the last several updates, but there are still many closed off parts of iOS that are wide open to customization and control on Android. While Apple updated, Google did not sit by without adding to Android devices. There are a plethora of great Android smartphones that deliver features you will not find on the iPhone and iOS 9. After you read the Android vs iPhone comparison you still need to pick the right Android smartphone or the right iPhone. You can use this list of reasons Android is better than the iPhone to help decide if you should buy a Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, wait for the Galaxy S8 or LG G6 this year or if you should buy the iPhone 7. Some shoppers may not care about every reason, but knowing what the competition offers makes it easier to decide which smartphone you should buy in 2017. More Choice with Android Apple offers more choice than we’ve seen from them before with the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone SE as well as older models — but you still only have three screen sizes and two designs to pick from. Android delivers more options with waterproof phones, different screen sizes, more colors, different materials and other differentiating factors. With Android smartphones users can choose a waterproof option like the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge or go with a modular design like the LG G5. 2017 brings newer designs and options. There is also support for a huge screen with a built-in stylus with the Note 6. In addition to these big names, there are many other options from Motorola, Huawei and if you include last year’s releases a number of other interesting options. There are also options to buy an Android phone with wireless charging or a replaceable battery, neither of which is available without adding a case to the iPhone. Users can pick the phone size and design they want, and they can also pick a phone that offers a replaceable battery, a great camera or another feature without limiting to just two phones for the latest features and user experience. Micro SD Card Support The 16GB iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus options don’t offer enough room for most users, and that is the amount of storage you are stuck with until you buy a new iPhone in two years. if you want to buy more storage off the bat, you’ll spend $100 more for 64GB and $200 more for 128GB. Many Android phones support a Micro SD card that can store photos, videos and some apps so that you can easily add more storage for $15 to $30 with a small memory card. Even 16GB Android phones offer more use thanks to the ability to add a Micro SD card to the mix. Some phones support up to a 128GB Micro SD card and almost all current Android phones with a Micro SD card slot can handle a 64GB Micro SD Card. Google Maps is Better on Android Use Google Maps easier on Android. You can install Google Maps on the iPhone, but you cannot make it the default app. This means Siri will always get directions in Apple Maps. The Apple Maps app is better than it was at launch, but it is still missing many points of interest, complete streets and neighborhoods and it still sends on on weird routes very often. On Android, Google Maps offers transit directions in more cities, better driving directions, a deep point of interest search that works more often and it is integrated into the phone so that addresses open into Google Maps unless you choose to use an alternate mapping service. Easy to Clear Cache to Get Space Back Quickly reclaim space on Android faster than on iPhone. Apps often download photos, videos and other pieces of information to your phone as you use them. If you look at the size of an app like Vine or Instagram on the iPhone or Android you’ll likely see a lot of storage space in use. This is because the app can keep data related to the photos and videos that it downloads. On the iPhone you need to delete the app and re-install it to get that space back. If you are using a 16GB iPhone, you may do this once every month or two. On Android the app often includes an option to clear the cache, even if the iPhone version doesn’t. If that doesn’t work you can also clear the cache of an app in the Android software. Android Widget Support is Better Widgets on Android are better than on the iPhone. On Android users can choose widgets to show on the lock screen and on their home screen. This puts weather information, a live calendar and other information that each user finds important with a glance at the screen. On the iPhone users can add some widgets with iOS 8 and that are still in iOS 10, but they are only in the Notification Center and Apple is notoriously picky about what the widgets can do and what they cannot do. It’s easier to tap a widget on the home screen than it is to open the Notification Center, count to three for all the widgets to load and change the location of the one you want to tap, and then tap it. Android Customization Blows iPhone Away Users enjoy more customization on Android than on the iPhone. On Android users can install a new launcher that changes the overall look of the home screen. Many Android versions include small options to change themes for color and other tweaks. Samsung and other companies are even going further with themes that change more than just the main color of the phone. If you want more control over what your phone looks like without the need to jailbreak, Android is the better option. Android Default App Choices Are Better Choose a default Android app. You cannot do this on iPhone. On the iPhone Apple does not let you choose new default apps. Safari, Mail and Apple Maps are the default and unless you are in a third-party app that lets you choose which browser to use there is no real choice. Deep linking helps you stick in apps you like, but it’s not as good as setting your favorite browser, mail client or other app. On Android users can choose a default app to handle almost any task. This includes picking an app to watch YouTube links, Twitter links, send email with, browse the web and much more. Users can choose a new default and reset the default app later if they need to choose new one. Split Screen Multitasking on Android The top Android phones from Samsung and LG offer the option to use two apps on-screen at the same time. This multitasking makes it possible to chat and look at a document or work and watch content without a second device. On a small phone screen there are limits to the usefulness, but it is an option that we enjoy on Android. The iPhone does not support running two apps on the screen at the same time so you need to switch back and forth if you are talking to someone about a webpage or document. Apple added support for this to the iPad, but so far it is not available on the iPhone. Multiple User Support on Android Switch users on Android phones easily. We don’t share our phones with others the same way we share a tablet, but it is nice to have a multi-user mode on Android phones running Android 5.0 Lollipop and higher. This includes the option to create an account with limited access for your kid, a guest account so you can lend a device without sharing your info. There is even an option to pin a screen so that when you hand someone your phone they can’t see more than what you are showing them. The iPhone offers no support for multiple users and no real kids mode without going through a complicated process to lock one app to the screen. Install Android Apps from Any Source Unless you jailbreak the iPhone or rely on shady user profiles there is no way to install apps on the iPhone outside of the App Store. On Android you can choose an option that lets you install apps from any location. You can side-load an app that is not on the Google Play Store so that you can use any app you need to. This also makes it possible to run apps not specifically designed to work with your phone. Android Wireless Charging One the really great Android features that we see is wireless charging. The Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge and many other Android phones include wireless charging built-in. This allows you to charge by simply setting your phone down on a pad, or setting it in a wireless charging cradle in your car. Speed improvements make wireless charging faster and more usable than ever. Not every new Android phone offers this, so check before you buy. On the iPhone you need to buy a special wireless charging iPhone case or build your own iPhone wireless charging case if you want this feature. For users who don’t like cases this is not as nice as a built-in option. Download Movies & Music From Anywhere You can download music, movies and shows from almost anywhere. If you want to add music or movies to your iPhone you need to download them on a computer and sync with iTunes or purchase them inside an app and only use them in that app. Yes, the iPhone lets you download Spotify music, download movies from iTunes and other movie services without a computer, but on Android you can download right from the web. On the iPhone it is not possible to download the Louis CK comedy special right to the device, so users need to stream it. On Android a user can download this file to the phone or Micro SD card to watch offline without needing a computer. There are similar benefits to buying music online if you don’t want to buy through iTunes. Google Now & Google Assistant Beat Siri Hey Siri is useful, and Siri can finally connect to a variety of third-party apps, but it pales in comparison to the connectivity that Google Now and the Google Assistant offer. On many Android devices users can say, “OK Google,” or a custom command to wake the phone up for voice control without touching it or it being connected to power. Users can also choose which app Google Now should use for an activity. Instead of restricting users to Google Music, a command to play an artist can open Spotify or another music app. Google Now also does a great job of showing useful and relevant information for users on the Google Now home screen. With the Pixel you also get Google Assistant. More Mobile Payment & NFC Options The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus include NFC to let users make mobile payments, but that is the only function and there is only one option — Apple Pay. On Android phones users can use NFC to control phone settings, trigger tasks like turning on car mode or setting the phone to home mode. Android phones also support Android Pay for payments and other options like Samsung Pay. Some of these only support limited banks, like Apple Pay, but you do have more options. With Samsung Pay, you can even pay on normal credit card machines without advanced NFC chips. Android Notifications Are Appealing On the iPhone Notifications stack up in the Notification Center and quickly turn it into an unusable mess because clearing a notification is an annoying double tap procedure that involves small touch targets unless you have a newer phone with 3D Touch. On Android users can swipe to the side to remove a notification and on many devices you can see deliver incredibly useful notifications on the lock screen that let users see what the notification is about at a glance. 35 Responses 02/19/2015 Jeffrey A. Finfrock Reply #16 Android phones just plain look better. Even the inexpensive ones have a look of class and professionalism about them. The Apple iPhones, even the expensive ones, look like el cheapo kids toys. 02/19/2015 Adam Conn Reply Please tell me you’re being sarcastic?! 05/27/2015 Seth Reply Apple is a boring looking phone. Sorry, but these are opinions and beauty is in the eye of the phone holder. On the stats side… Apple is designer grade fluff. Any thing it can do Android can do better or at least with more flexibility. Truth hurts, Apple is only for the few the proud the elitist. 02/01/2017 Andrew O'Neill Reply Agreed. It seems like the cheaper the phone being made now a days the more it looks like an iPhone. See some of those Chinese near clones for proof of that. 02/20/2015 CM Reply 1 reason iPhone is better: less wide, for those of us who don’t have gorilla hands, without compromising on the specs. (From a disgruntled Android owner) 05/27/2015 Seth Malloy Reply I think the 15 previous reasons out weigh that positive, but there are also smaller Android options for users with smaller hands. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2014/12/26/5-small-screen-android-phones-that-are-worth-buying/ 11/15/2015 brentney Reply Well, you see every new iPhone is bigger than the last so they can have a bigger screen. Android size doesn’t change as much as iPhone 04/17/2015 Christian Reply One annoying caveat to this feature is that if yourdefault app updates you have to select it again next time. That gets a little tiresome with the frequent updates that Android appps put out. 07/16/2015 Paul Reply Seriously???? At least if your app is out of date on an Android you can still use 99.9% of them….as soon as your iPhone app has an update it shuts down until you update it…and then you have to go through iTunes… Long live the anywhere accessibility and customisation of Android!!! 05/26/2016 Sean williams Reply You’re wrong I have an iPhone and I can use any app that has an update without being locked out of it right now I have apps that I don’t update and I’m still able to use it just like I do on my note 5 07/30/2015 billlittle09 Reply Having had an iPhone for two years and a droid turbo for 6 months I can unequivocally state that for business the iPhone is years ahead of the droid. What I could do on an iPhone in minutes takes a half hour of fumbling around trying to get the proper settings just to come close to what I had before. It is going to be a long 18 months until I can get back to the superiority of an iPhone. 09/05/2016 Brennan Eden Reply Really curious how an older iPhone could be better for business than the successor to the phone I currently use (Droid Maxx) when you can’t even transfer files with the newest ones (iphone 6s). I had to fix my roommates internet using my phone because apparently iphones can’t download a driver and transfer it to a computer even when they are plugged in. But if you want to be chained down by itunes, that’s on you. 10/01/2015 Lee Reply I first got the iphone 3s but after 3 years I decided to try android through pure curiosity. It was a revelation concerning the amazing freedom & much greater functionality I experienced. I recently decided to go back to iOS to experience the hype of the 6s. To my disappointment, I found that the phone had changed shape but quickly began to remember that familiar feeling of feeling fenced in by the iOS imposed structure & the very dissapointing feeling that apple had not really changed that much. In addition, the 6s lacked the quality of the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge that I have elected to have after only 2 days with the iphone. 11/02/2015 nisha Reply i think that i-phones are more better 11/04/2015 Jeff Reply The iphone is pure trash. Nearly every dropped phone results in a damaged screen. You are chained in to the itunes cage, which is the least user friendly platform ever created. In contrast, androids app store is better with more free options. The Galaxy S5 destroys any iphone to date. It is built better. It has a better screen. It has a far superior camera and takes superior video. Furthermore… no crappy itunes. You can do it all from the handset. Simple things like add or delete music without the poorly designed software, itunes. If you are an iphone user, get ready to switch. Eventually, android phones will put the stagnant, overrated Apple phone line in to extinction. Did I mention that you needn’t take your android to a pretentious store to have the battery replaced? Nope. You simply remove the rear cover and replace it yourself. Consider all I have said. Apple keeps all the control. No thank you. 12/06/2015 Nadee Reply You can not download anything in the iPhone and in the ipad if you are lecture video you can not download it to watch it again then the point comes why i spend 800$ 06/03/2016 caleb tiner Reply It’s all preference really. IPhone users seem to be arrogant assholes though lol. Can’t argue the points made here. I myself have a note 5 and I love it. 06/09/2016 Drew Reply Of course android is better iPhone always keeps you locked in and you can’t download the apps you want if there not supported with Android your free as can be apple basically controls your phone for you without any custimaition 06/21/2016 Bright Joe Reply iPhone is kinda boring to use. It has some limitations which Android users will never face. Android users have the freedom to change and do whatever they like, but in an iPhone it’s barely possible to customize as you like. So, I really prefer Android for the price point too. 09/12/2016 lebron Reply okay your lies 06/26/2016 drm Reply Why to buy an over priced Apple manufactured by fenatics of unfreedom- who can’t understand anything beyond corporate monopoly & profiteering? 07/04/2016 RICK RICK Reply APPLE JUST SIMPLY SUCKS!!!!! BOTTOME LINE!!!!! 07/13/2016 Isaiah Lynch Reply This is how i feel about it. Honestly im a android guy always have been. But i know there are pros and cons to both. With iphone they have better malware protection and better app developments. Android depending on the phone like my Note had better specs and more freedom. The thing is though iphones better protection is because they are so private and restrictive. People keep saying a pro for iphone is that they have regular updates bu thats because they release a unfinished phone software. Android rarely has updates because they give you all the features right away while apple gives you features android users been had update by update. On the other hand android tends to get malware pretty easily in comparison to apple. But thats when it comes down to dont go on dumb sites. Another thing i find is android users tend to know what makes their phone better and why while iphone users like someone said above are just assholes repeating their phone is better. Personally i believe many people buy these iphones just due to seeing others with them or celebrities..not because its the better phone. So personally to me the only 2 things android would need to fix is the malware protection and making a official videochat….thats about it. Iphone needs to be less restrictive and stop releasing unready phones. Oh and a last note ive tended to see a lot more cracked iphones than androids by far so thats something to think about. Durability.But when it comes down to it id give android a 8/10 and iphones 5.5 or 6/10. So when it comes down to it…if youre a big time social media person then youd probably like apple better just following with the trends other whise..ANDROID ALL DAY EVERYDAY 03/03/2017 ofhgluyjk Reply hi 08/10/2016 Tyler Wyman Reply Well Google Allo and Duo is adding in a official video chat which I think needs to be a Android exclusive because I don’t think iPhone needs a new video chat that is already like FaceTime and hopefully Allo and Duo will be an standard for Android N. So everybody has it and not just people who know about it and downloaded it because I have hope in Allo and Duo I believe it can be the next iMessage with many features that most messengers on Android don’t have 08/25/2016 stef Reply I am glad I read all these comments…I am switching to an android!! Apple has disappointed me thoroughly through the years. If I don’t upgrade to the new years model it doesn’t work and I still have to pay til the contract ends. Currently I spent five hours at the Apple store because of the new ios upgrade and apple cannot even get it to work. :( I am getting an android tomorrow! I am done with Apple’s games. Very dissatisfied customer 08/30/2016 Bubba Jones Reply After reading all these posts, sadly spelling is atrocious, grammar and word usage needs improving as does punctuation. Yes, all those things matter; folks take pride in yourselves. 10/02/2016 Scott McDonald Reply For the click hungry editors of this site…every time I come here I’m reminded why I don’t regularly visit this or other similar sites that are just click bait / click hungry sites. For 15 reasons Android is better than iphone I leave as soon as I see that you expect readers to go 15 pages deep into your site to read the whole thing, one reason per page is stupid. That’s obvious click counting BS and shows the true, non informative, nature of the site. Cya. 11/30/2016 Jacki Reply Well as a user of both. I love the android, in fact I loved my SG S6 Edge Plus. but i had to go back to the iphone 6s Plus, b/c my android phones always heat up. battery life sucks, the apps aren’t as pretty, and all my music in itunes. also i ride a motorcycle and i was out one day and my android phone froze, not acceptable. iphone has never frozen, very dependable. so sorry the iphone is my choice. 12/06/2016 Shalie de Souza Reply Hey JOSH, Great information provided. I appreciate your work.This is what I was looking for from last week. now i totally agree with you Android is better than I Phone . By the way thanks for the such a useful article. Thanks Shalie 01/08/2017 Bill Slattery Reply I have used Samsung since the Galaxy S2. I also use iPads and find both systems have their merits. For business the iOS is more secure. For personal use the Android system is more customizable. I am finding Samsung a bit slow on OS updates lately. A 2 year old device may, or may not get an OS upgrade. With Apple my wife’s iPad and my son’s iPod continually get the OS updates even after 3 years. This is the one beef I am having with android. I love using them but, do not necessarily want to buy a new device every two years. I would like to get at least 3 years before my expensive device is obsolete. I prefer music on Android (hate iTunes…too lang to make a simple playlist). Android “drag and drop” is so easy. Am not a Fanboy of either but simplicity and customer support should not be mutually exclusive. 02/17/2017 Poline Reply Thanks for the great research. As I’ve read recently developers prefer Android platform. And it’s a growing development power of the Android platform. In spite of this research iOS and Android platforms are used in apps for business and entertainment. Read more about android vs ios development 03/03/2017 james Reply i hate this website 03/03/2017 ofhgluyjk Reply ok you lied 04/09/2017 Nick Jennings Reply Ok here is yet another biased article. I’m not surprised that Android articles are solely based on looks and appareance. That’s a sad thing to compare to an Apple phone. Keep your Androids cause it’s all gimmicky…period. User experience and total reliability are hands down won with the iPhone without a doubt. Did you compare the actual usage, no? That’s right, because your Android looks good. Remember this when trying to say Android beats Apple… Apple closes apps and clears cache and stops the apps from running all at once with a single swipe. Does Android do this, no. Apple runs a lot faster with less hardware that’s better made. Samsung claims it has the best hardware but come on, seriously! Who needs up to 4GB RAM and OCTA Core processors? Oh wait, a power hungry operating system much like windows, interesting. But wait, your Android phone is nice with those gimmicky widgets and a gooey interface. This type of article has no basis at all. The inability to gather real actual comparisons is just sad and like always, Android fans grab at straws by always claiming there precious Androids can be easily customized. Sorry but that’s all your Android is good at, customization. Android truly lacks in overall performance. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Breaking911 Home Contact News Tips Politics Crime Terrorism Video Entertainment Weather Home Business Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results Business Politics Tech Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results April 9, 2017 0 134 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Photo Source: BBC First fact-checking came to Facebook. Now it’s coming to Google. The world’s largest search engine is rolling out a new feature that places “Fact Check” tags on snippets of articles in its News results. The Alphabet unit had already run limited tests. On Friday, it extended the capability to every listing in its News pages and massive search catalog. This is the latest sign Google is responding to mounting pressure to police content it hosts online after criticism the company, and other internet firms, help spread misinformation. Google isn’t entirely giving up its usual hands-off approach: The company is letting others do the fact-checking. The approach is meant to legitimize or question claims online, Google said in a blog post. Checked search results list the name of the person or group making the assertion and the determination of the fact-checker. Although Google is working with established fact-checking organizations, like PolitiFact and Snopes, it’s also opening up the system to publishers including The Washington Post and The New York Times. In theory, media organizations could use the new feature to fact-check each other. Or publishers could give different verdicts on the veracity of the same article. “These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgments,” Google said. “Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.” While any publisher can apply to add fact-check labels to content, Google search algorithms will determine whether they appear in results, a spokeswoman said. The company plans to reserve the label for search results about addressable public claims of fact, rather than opinion. Publishers can write the labels that appear next to results. Examples include “True,” “Mostly False,” or “Pants on Fire!” (a favorite of PolitiFact). Outcry over the influence of misinformation, or “fake news,” began after the U.S. presidential election. Facebook, a leading driver of online traffic to publishers in the U.S., took the brunt of criticism. On Thursday, the company introduced new features in its flagship social network designed to show users how to detect false news. But Google has not been immune to scrutiny. Critics have pointed to several instances of inaccurate and misleading articles surfacing in search results. Such examples are particularly stark when Google delivers what it finds in the form of tiny snippets, a priority for the company in recent years. “From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told BBC News shortly after the U.S. election. Google is not paying publications or fact-checking organizations. A spokeswoman for Google said articles that used the new fact-check label would not be ranked differently in search results.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Apr 9, 2017 at 5:00PM Both Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are trading near their all-time highs. Amazon's stock has climbed so much in the past 12 months, it's made its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos the second wealthiest person in the world, recently surpassing Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega. Alphabet shares are up a modest 11%, compared with Amazon's 51% increase. But investors can't dwell too much on the past. They need to look to the future to determine which stocks offer the best opportunities for further gains. Today we'll compare the two tech giants head to head to determine which is a better buy: Amazon.com or Alphabet. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon is firing on all cylinders Amazon's core retail business is strong. It generated $124 billion in revenue in 2016 across its North American and international retail segments. That's up 25% from $99 billion in 2015. Amazon's growth is fueled by increasing Prime membership, which acts as a huge incentive for both customers and merchants to use Amazon's marketplace before looking elsewhere. A survey from BloomReach found that 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. But what's really driving Amazon's stock price higher is its more profitable operating segment, Amazon Web Services. AWS is Amazon's cloud computing service, which supports all sorts of web applications, from basic websites to huge data-consuming apps such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). AWS sales increased 55% last year to $12.2 billion. More importantly, the segment's operating profit of $3.1 billion is about three times as much as Amazon's retail business. Amazon is also expanding into other high-margin businesses. Its advertising business is growing rapidly, albeit on a small base. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowack estimates that Amazon's ad business could grow to $5 billion by next year and $7 billion by 2020. And those sales are high margin, which means that despite the relatively small revenue compared with the rest of Amazon's retail segment, Amazon could see significant profit growth. Nowack notes, however, that Amazon's ad revenue growth shouldn't cut into Google's core search ad sales. Alphabet is as steady as ever Alphabet may have changed its name to reflect its other bets besides Google, but the online advertising business is still its core business. Google accounted for 99% of the company's revenue and 118% of its operating income in 2016, while "other bets" produced an operating loss. Image source: Google Google is managing to expand its already dominant share of the search advertising market. eMarketer expects Google to expand its share by 16.1% to claim roughly 78% of the U.S. search market this year. Google growth is being fueled by its Android operating system, which recently became the most popular operating system across all devices. Google is also extremely popular across other mobile OSes, and consumers are turning to their smartphones more often to look up details on just about anything. That means more Google searches and more search ad revenue. YouTube is also a dominant force on mobile, with the average mobile viewer spending 40 minutes watching video per session as of mid-2015. YouTube is currently under scrutiny for displaying ads before objectionable content, but Google has quickly taken steps to counteract the issues. The negative impact on Google should be relatively small. Lots of growth, but which should you buy? The growth outlook for both Amazon and Alphabet is quite strong, so how can investors decide which to buy? Both companies have strong balance sheets with huge amounts of cash and relatively little debt. Alphabet's $86 billion in cash and equivalents, however, completely dwarfs Amazon's $26 billion. Alphabet even has less long-term debt than Amazon. Alphabet also produces more cash from operations -- $36 billion, versus $16 billion. That's not to say Amazon's struggling for cash, but Alphabet is in a better position. Perhaps more telling are the valuation multiples investors are putting on both companies. Amazon currently trades for a price-to-earnings multiple of 182.6. Alphabet (C shares) is comparatively cheap at 29.6 times earnings. But analysts are significantly more bullish on Amazon's earnings growth prospects, expecting an average of 72.7% earnings growth over the next five years, compared with just 19% for Alphabet.  Google's growth is coming from the megatrend of advertisers who are shifting more ad dollars to digital while consumers spend more time searching and watching videos on their smartphones. Amazon's growth will come from AWS and the emergence of other high-margin categories such as advertising. Amazon is also working off a much smaller net-income base than Alphabet. Its growth is much less certain than Alphabet's, but it has the potential to pay off in the long run. If you can stomach the up-and-down nature of Amazon stock, I think it makes a better long-term buy despite its sky-high valuation. For more conservative growth investors, Alphabet is an excellent option.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Google rolling out a new look for sign-in, deprecating old methods Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:30am PDTApr 7, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 166 Share on Facebook 70 Share on Twitter Total Shares263 Development Google News Starting on April 10th Google plans on pushing out an update to the sign-in page for Google accounts. This change is meant to further unify the sign-in process across your various devices. Although the news was posted to the G Suite Developers blog, we do fully expect this change to affect all Google accounts on all browsers, mobile browsers, and iOS apps (Android apps should not be affected). Google's SSO will also see additional changes beyond the purely cosmetic, as a new permissions grant redirect will be added to the login process, and permissions requested by a site or service will be more explicitly stated. The privacy-conscious will be excited to hear that Google is making such an effort to ensure a greater awareness on the part of users when it comes to privacy and consent in the use of third party services. Unfortunately, the permission request pane will no longer list what Google considers to be "standard" permission requests, presumably including basic account information. At least Google is making some effort to increase privacy awareness during login, even going so far as to increase the burden of responsibility for that privacy on developers by requiring contact information to be listed at a link on the permissions page. These aren't the only changes to login Google will be making. The use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe after April 20th, so if you are a developer relying on a webview redirect for OAuth to grant permissions you should consider changing to the official methods very soon before it breaks. Even some large companies like Airbnb and Pocket still haven't updated to the new methods, so it's worth taking a look. The rollout for the new sign-in is expected to be quite extended, potentially requiring more than two weeks for full visibility, so don't be surprised if you don't notice any changes to your sign-in process for a while. Most people probably won't notice much of a change beyond the cosmetic, anyway (although, our readers certainly aren't most people).

Thanks. Matt I'm sure this was first hinted at during the last Google IO... or possibly earlier. Every time I had to login since hearing that announcement I lost my shit wondering what was taking so long. Josh Crumley Of all the companies out there taking our personal data and using it for profit, Google is by far the least secretive about it. I'm glad they're making the permissions more detailed. Pixelexel I don't trust any company with my data other than Google. Kanoosh i don't even really trust google , but they are the least worst imo so i i go with them. :) HSidhu Google won't give your data to anyone, your Data is their power. Kanoosh never assume just because someone tells you something , that it is true.. i still hold plenty of caution with google as should everyone else.. no tin foil hats here, just reality of things... but i do hold them in higher regard for my personal data then any others , just always good to be safe. catalysto It's not just because "someone said so". It's because if Google was ever caught actually selling/releasing user data, they'd be completely screwed. Their entire business model depends on them keeping your data private.

They treat their customers well with the knowledge that that behaviour will net them more customers. The two notions are not in conflict. Avieshek Rajkhowa Facebook's the worst, Google's the better. Summerer The 'keep me logged in' button will be removed and instead you will always stay logged in until you explicitly logout in a browser. Seems kinda insecure or at least intransparent for the average user Devin Rodriguez Honestly it's never been very effective for me anyway. Every few days I found myself having to re-enter my password and sometimes even my 2FA regardless of whether I checked the box or not. Rabia Atta they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Devin Rodriguez What? Indefinite Implosion they should have added speedness like bing.com....its too fastyer than google Ryne Hager I agree, I think he was fairly clear on that point. Devin Rodriguez Oh, okay. abc But which is the fastyest? BC This is interesting and I do like the the fact that the permissions are highlighted more than they were before. This is a good thing indeed! Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ use of Webview for OAuth will also be given the axe Thank god. I absolutely hate apps that do that for Google / Facebook / Twitter permission request. If the first party app is installed, popup permission request screen on those apps. Don't load a webview asking me to login with email, password, 2FA. I wish FB and Twitter will also do what Google is doing now. Drunk Squirrel Like how titanium backup opens a webview of Google sign in in order to backup to Google drive, as opposed to other apps which show up a single pop-up,, correct Ryne Hager Right? They've got libraries for that, why make me enter my information again on a device I'm already logged in on? Imagine all the time that could have been saved. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I didn't even mention "save this new browser?" screen and "logged in from a new machine" emails that those webview logins cause. I uninstall any app that uses that, no matter how good the app otherwise is. HSidhu hello @ryne Hager aka new guy :) Ryne Hager Yo! Josh Crumley Welcome to the club! HSidhu nice posts man !

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares165 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Latheryin You missed dirty unicorns which was the first to release 7.1.2 for the shamu. Also most of the bugs you mention are only in Rome based of LOS/CM. Rudresh Please share some for the N7 2013 too, pretty please! R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick PhantomGamers I managed to brick my N6 by fastboot flashing the latest update, making sure it boots, and then locking my bootloader which then caused me to bootloop when starting. Tried everything to unbrick it, but couldn't reunlock it because it required me to toggle a setting in developer options which would have required it to boot in the first place. I guess pro tip would be to always wipe data FIRST and then confirm it boots before relocking bootloader. TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch. That's my favorite thing a out keep being my grocery list.

The company continues to step up the game by adding some nice cool features, including animated emojis, faster GIF search, Lucky bot, and a soon-to-be added desktop version. Once again, the chat app is stepping up the game by adding a new feature that will enable you to create a poll in private and group chat. Called Polling feature in a tweet posted by Amit Fulay, Head of Product Google Allo, the new feature will let you begin a poll by typing “@yesno” in the chat box followed by your question. A poll can easily be created by the bot, which opens up a vote that allows anyone including yourself to participate in. For now, you can only answer yes or no during the poll; no custom option is enabled at the moment [it is not immediately clear if Google intends to add custom options any time soon]. The tick option that appears next to the poll, according to Gadgets.NDTV.com, lets you close the poll at any time. Don’t you all get your hopes high because the feature for now, is only available to users in India; with no exact word on when other regions will be able to access it. Google an array of chat apps on the Play Store and on the Apple Store; and users oftentimes get confused when it comes to choosing the right one. Recently, the company revamped Hangouts to make the app more appealing to people. If this would work, only time will tell; but at the moment, all eyes seem to be on Allo and maybe Duo video calling app. The company recently made it known to everyone that its users could soon be presented with a desktop version of their favorite app. Limiting users’ ability to use Allo to mobile alone affected its growth; but things are about to change if all works according to plan. Google’s VP of Communications, Nick Fox tweeted the news on his Twitter Page in February. It’s still early days, but Fox said in his tweet that users can look forward to the desktop version of the chat app very soon. Better late than never—and the fact that Google has woken up to the fact that Allo needs a desktop version, makes a lot of sense. The growth of the app which has stalled in the last couple of weeks is about to change. Expect the following features when the desktop version of Google Allo gets the all clear: The web/desktop version of Google Allo will provide support for the very popular Google Assistant. This feature, as you know, is the most popular addition to the chat app, and is one of the reasons many users continue to install and use Allo. So, expect to see AI as part of the yet-to-be launched desktop version of Allo. Not sure about this one, but the desktop version of Allo could feature Stickers and Emojis; so be on the lookout for any or both features. Probably won’t be a Windows or Mac app, so don’t be surprised if the developers limit it to a Chrome app. Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Ola Ric Ola Ric is a professional tech writer.

Kim Jin-a/AP hide caption toggle caption Kim Jin-a/AP The Department of Labor is suing Google to obtain payroll data to determine whether the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. Google's lawyer has called the lawsuit a "fishing expedition." Kim Jin-a/AP Just three days after Google announced that it had "closed the gender pay gap globally" on Equal Pay Day, a Department of Labor official testified in federal court that there is "systemic" discrimination against women at Google. Silicon Valley has often come under fire in recent years for being unfriendly to women, with sexual harassment allegations and lawsuits over gender bias. But a DoL official told The Guardian Friday that Google's discrimination was "extreme," even for the industry. The government is suing Google, a government contractor, to release compensation data in order to make sure the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. In a press release about the lawsuit, the DoL said that Google has had "many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily," but has "refused to do so." Google, for its part, has denied that the company has a gender discrimination problem, and called the DoL's request a "fishing expedition." Harin Contractor was an economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor under President Obama, and he says the pay gap is complicated. There are a number of factors that contribute, including women taking time out of the workforce for maternity leave, or to care for aging parents or other relatives. But there is a portion of the pay gap that can't be accounted for by these situations. "These companies need to try a little harder to encourage diversity," Contractor says, adding that often in the tech industry the people making hiring and promotion decisions are white men. "Sometimes they can get caught up in their bubble and feel like they're very open," he says. "But when it's always the same type of person making the decisions. ... maybe it's not conscious." For the past several years, Google has released its diversity data publicly in an annual report, that has shown a persistent dearth of women and minorities at the top. Last year, women represented just 31 percent of Google's workforce, and held just 24 percent of leadership roles.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch.

Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick PhantomGamers I managed to brick my N6 by fastboot flashing the latest update, making sure it boots, and then locking my bootloader which then caused me to bootloop when starting. Tried everything to unbrick it, but couldn't reunlock it because it required me to toggle a setting in developer options which would have required it to boot in the first place. I guess pro tip would be to always wipe data FIRST and then confirm it boots before relocking bootloader. TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

A US Department of Labour official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labour Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," Google said in its statement. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 per cent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labour Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret.

(Google) Related Stories Google Maps/Street View location for Beaumont Hamel Visit Vimy with Peter Mansbridge If you haven't been able to visit the Canadian First World War memorials in France, you can now take a virtual tour. Google has launched Street View imagery of Beaumont Hamel and Vimy Ridge, just in time for the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge on Sunday. "It's quite moving," Aaron Brindle, head of public affairs for Google Canada, told CBC Radio's Weekend A.M. "It does feel like a little piece of Canada in northern France that few of us get to visit, and up until now it's just been this dot on a map. But this is now a chance to actually go in and virtually explore this part of our shared history." Just as you can use Google Maps to see your house or downtown St. John's, you can now visit these memorial sites. Google Canada used drone footage to capture imagery — including the very top — of the Vimy Ridge Memorial. (Google ) For Vimy Ridge, that meant using drones to capture images of the monument, which stands 110 metres above the Douai Plain. "Now you can actually go and immerse yourself in these environments," Brindle said. The same technology used on top of Street View Google cars was condensed into a backpack for this project, Brindle said, with a large apparatus that extends over the head of whoever wears it.  Fifteen high-definition cameras capture imagery every two to three seconds as the person carrying the equipment walks. An accelerometer and gyroscope are also used to ensure a smooth experience while going through the imagery, Brindle added. Google has launched Street View imagery of the Vimy Ridge Memorial in France. (Google ) "I got a chance to wear the trekker and as I was walking through some of the preserved trenches around Vimy … I've never felt more Canadian [while] in northern France," he said. "I've never felt closer to Canada than when I was doing this project." To take a virtual tour for yourself, go to Google Maps and type in Beaumont Hamel or Vimy Ridge and drag the little peg man figure  — located in the bottom right corner — wherever there is a blue line.  "It's this opportunity to almost tell these stories through mapping … modern-day mapping, especially with Street View imagery associated with it, really does allow you to reflect these amazing moments," Brindle said. "Not only in our shared geography, but in our shared history." You can take a virtual walk through the preserved trenches at the Vimy Ridge Memorial.

You can revisit old haunts and take a virtual walk at street level. There's also lots of amusement to be had planning a route and making a rude shape with it. Until recently, users could also suggest edits and make revisions on the map database. But that's now changed. This had allowed maps to be updated with valuable local knowledge as building or construction changes were made. This particular functionality has been in place since 2008 and meant maps were kept fresh and up-to-date by people in the know. The Google Maps app is seen on an Apple iPhone 4S (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Sadly, because the edit function was open to all users, it meant that it got abused meaning all suggestions had to be moderated. Given the sheer volume of suggestions, the task of moderating each one was enormous, and proved to be too large. Google released a statement explaining their decision: "Since 2008, the Google Map Make community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense.

Don't have an account? Sign up now close Strategy for cyber crime: own the routers, own the Internet By Rick McElroy, Carbon Black Rick McElroy (CSO Online) on 10 April, 2017 05:18 0 - - - - print email Mobile devices and smart TVs controlled by cyber criminals make scary headlines. They have received a high profile in media coverage of the recent WikiLeaks CIA data dump. Yet lost in the leaks is something far scarier – the possibility that routers can be owned. A recent blog from Cisco highlights the real issues (Cisco’s words in italics): Malware exists that seems to target different types and families of Cisco devices, including multiple router and switches families. The malware, once installed on a Cisco device, seem to provide a range of capabilities: data collection, data exfiltration, command execution with administrative privileges (and without any logging of such commands ever been executed), HTML traffic redirection, manipulation and modification (insertion of HTML code on web pages), DNS poisoning, covert tunnelling and others. The malware authors have spent significant time making sure the tools, once installed, attempt to remain hidden from detection and forensic analysis on the device itself. It would also seem a malware author expends significant resources on quality assurance testing in order, it seems, to make sure that once installed the malware will not cause the device to crash or misbehave. The key takeaway in this post (and from the Vault 7 leak overall) is that our communications systems are not secure. It doesn’t matter if your smart TV is vulnerable when an attacker can control your network. If an attacker can control your routing tables and DNS, he/she can gain access to far more than your TV and mobile phone. Those devices are just the beginning. Let’s break these capabilities down and shine a spotlight on each one: Data Collection If I were an intelligence agency, I would want to do this all the time. If I can control a router or a switch, I can span ports and forward traffic. I can sniff without being found to do raw packet dumps. I can learn unencrypted passwords, browsing behaviours and interests, and conduct passive vulnerability assessments for exploitation, among many other things. Data Exfiltration Covert channels for data exfiltration are among the goals of any capable attacker. This capability makes incident response and forensics almost impossible. It would give someone the ability to redirect TCP and UDP packets to subvert security controls in place. Want to bypass a firewall? Or all the firewalls? This capability provides this at scale. Read more ​Cybersecurity nears tipping point Command execution with administrative privileges (and without any logging of such commands ever been executed) Attackers want the highest level of access to any system they can penetrate. In a normally secure Cisco environmentall commands are logged centrally. This provides an audit trail for change and configuration management and also speeds basic troubleshooting, in addition to being a great idea for security. Knowing when someone logs on and off is a key question to answer when managing security for a network infrastructure. From an IT perspective we need to know who’s made changes on the system. This is crucial for basic troubleshooting. From an infosec perspective, being able to log all changes made to a system and reviewing the log on a regular basis is Security 101. For a US-based public company, change management and configuration management are auditable. This capability bypasses good system management and also renders these controls non auditable. We all know rootkits are bad, but how do you detect and defend against a router rootkit? Read more ​Apple patches iPhone Broadcom wi-fi bug; Samsung Galaxy may be affected too HTML traffic redirection, manipulation and modification From a Web perspective what couldn’t I do with this ability? Proxy bypass. Filtering bypass. Build a complete copy of a website, which looks and feels just like the website you think you are logging into. All of a user’s transactions, web searchers, social media profiles, etc. can be manipulated literally as they cross the wire. Think about the implications of that for a second. A user opens their web browser, which connects to Google. Google then asks for authentication information. It’s Google. I know it’s Google because the browser says www.google.com and Google asks me to update my certificate. I know this is OK because I trust Google. I install the certificate and now my SSL connections are subverted.

We would bet if we compromised most people’s Google account we would own most of their other accounts as well. On the recent Ask Partner Network compromise it’s interesting to note that only certain customers were targeted specifically. There is no indication to date as to why they received the malicious payload while others didn’t. It’s possible that HTML redirection was used in these attacks.

Awesome, I control them, too. Read more Identifying the three steps of DDoS mitigation Final Thoughts We have discussed just the currently known capabilities. Based on the level of sophistication, I highly doubt we have covered them all. This is not the first leak revealing back doors on routers. In 2014, Edward Snowden disclosed that the NSA would intercept and bug a Cisco router before it was sent to a customer under surveillance. Think about the level of effort and cost it would take to divert a device in transit or intercept a shipping truck. You need people, planning, time, resources and technology to achieve goals on a single target. In that particular scenario one device, or a portion of one shipment, is under control. But this recent scenario is far different. Based on the latest leak, the capability to target a significant number of Cisco routers exists. This model is much more scalable and lends itself to better results. Exploiting a router in place costs ways less than intercepting a shipping truck in the middle of the night and is much more scalable. Attackers can now own the entire Internet. Want to own one device? Intercept it in transit. Want to own the Internet? Own the routers. All these tools are now public. We expect WikiLeaks to make more vulnerabilities public in the near future. As a community we must elevate this discussion. These capabilities exist to better protect nations and infrastructures. When offensive capabilities we have built start falling into the hands of malicious actors looking to do harm and materially damaging cyber defensive operations, it is time to ask the question: As governments review security exposure, secure unified workspaces lead the way for business More from Blackberry Join the CSO newsletter!

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares176 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu has led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? thespacecowboy Network ads are only on shows you've recorded yourself. Google ads are on the on-demand stuff, Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks. Carson Saldanha ?` Shawn Spring I'm hoping this and Nick Jr (for the kiddos) comes sooner rather than later! freshprince_87 I hope they add it soon Lateef Alabi-Oki I think the nailed the user interface. Can't wait for the Google Assistant and Android TV integration. Carson Saldanha Home tab should be on the left :P Ammy <-«¬­}­If you're seeking for genuine internet home based business venture however frustrated from internet frauds in that case this is certainly what you need.

Tucker Sferro $35 is outrageous. You might as well jest get cable. Jacob Fulbright After you add in YouTube Red, Netflix, Hulu (or the ad-free premium Hulu), HBO GO, etc., yeah, cable isn't looking so bad anymore. Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either Naxx ENVY 1) some services don't allow you to share with other people and is considered a breach of contract 2) i get what he's saying, we have to have 5-6 differernt contracts to watch shows when cable covers it all not sure i like how its all going tbh, its going to end up being more expensive to have the same channels. .. just the illusion of choice BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings abc Cable eats up your data cap? Lateef Alabi-Oki I don't have a data cap. Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af Brandon Giesing My family switched from AT&T to Charter Spectrum (before the whole Spectrum branding became a thing) because AT&T had around a 150 GB per month cap and once you hit that you had to pay like $20 extra to add 40 more GB. With 4 people constantly streaming music and video, downloading apps and Linux distros, and much more; we not only hit that every month but had to pay the extra $20 3-5 times every month. Our bills was like $300+ a month (Internet and Phone, not counting the separate expensive TV bill which was either DirecTV or DISH) Geoff Johnson Be glad you don't have Comcast, they have a 1TB cap. Malachi Jones Damn, here in the UK we have some providers offering £14.99/month internet only deals, super cheap in comparison to $99/month! Geoff Johnson What's the speed at 14.99/mo? thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. thespacecowboy The mobile access is huge. I think the other suppliers limit what you can watch on mobile, whereas with YouTube it's baked right in to the product offering. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Shawn Medeiros Get a HDTV antenna. You can get those right over the air free in much of the us. thespacecowboy Yeah. We did this about 18 months ago and use a Tivo OTA with lifetime service. Shame there are not more OTA channels. I'm going to attempt cable card but its not easy (the bracket is there but not the full thing which has to be bought separately). Geoff Johnson Do you have any idea how much cable TV actually costs? Tucker Sferro yes - after cutting the cord I receive about 1 letter per week from Fios begging me to come back, with basic packages starting around $29/mo. Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader Bruce Wayne Calm down. Android TV will come in due time. It's a new service. It's not even available nationwide yet. Midnitte Hopefully it exists once it launches nationally, but it's really silly they dont yet have an Android *TV* app for their *TV* service. Zachary Dunn Android TV should be a key feature of their TV offering. Not having it at launch is ridiculous. Not to mention, Youtube Gaming has been out for over a year and still doesn't have Android TV support, which is odd since Android TV is a platform built for streaming and gaming. Play Music on Android TV hasn't received any features released in the last year. Everytime Google releases a tv app without Android TV support, ppl say just wait for it, but it never happens or is half assed. KChristainsen you would think this is a no brainier to have an app for ATV. Just ridiculous. YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. thespacecowboy If you like that, check out George Clark's Amazing Spaces. It's on UK Channel 4 but likely available elsewhere. http://www.channel4.com/programmes/george-clarkes-amazing-spaces cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature thespacecowboy Only on things you recorded yourself, not on demand. Geoff Johnson Hulu doesn't have live TV. tim242 We were not talking about live TV. AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. DirkBelig Well that blows. Ramon Very. The only one that came close to this support is DirectTV Now. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. Geoff Johnson Then stream the 1080p version John Doe Hi, have you meet Netflix? Also, there is the choice I am not saying Google should force everyone's stream to the highest resolution (They don't even do that now, there is auto select). FYI, HDR has nothing to do with 4K and it actually does not add much to a the bandwidth requirement (Netflix said it adds 2.5MB/s compared to 12MB/s for 4K) Lars Jeppesen Do the channels even broadcast in 1080p or 4K? Box Most slim bundles and IPTV setups are only available in 720p at this time. YouTube TV is not alone in this. John Doe Most do in 1080i and I only have one 4K channel through Dish Network. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! PhantomGamers For sure you'll only get the channels that Google has agreements with, I doubt they're just grabbing up every OTA signal and streaming that. thespacecowboy It's going to depend on market. But I have many PBS on my Tivo, but none on my Youtube TV. Any device that has Chromecast should work. Some at the moment don't seem to work though (such as some Vizio TVs). After you pay for your 2nd month (after trial) they will send you a free Chromecast anyway. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. hp-fourtwenty no, you have the option to record all games of any team you select, which also adds it as a recommendation when you log in. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. Lars Jeppesen No hp-fourtwenty 50 live channels, and this is the first time I've been able to watch a New York Rangers game online without needing a traditional cable package or watching a pirated stream. I'm happy to pay only $35...especially since I already pay $10 for GPMAA/red thespacecowboy Isn't GPMAA on top of the $35? hp-fourtwenty yup, plus yt red exclusive programming...just no ad free yt red....and strangely no yttv background playback DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams. Acquire more channels. Lars Jeppesen People still watch MTV? Geoff Johnson Of course... Dirty Dave http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_youtube-tv2-768x432.jpg Im in the UK so this article is pointless for me, but what keyboard is this though Ryan? Ryan Definitely interesting. Ill hold off until college ball is back on, I only really care about OTA and ESPNs, so they have that advantage. sloheim "For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord" Wrong, wrong, for the love of god, WRONG. No NHL Network, NFL Network, or MLB Network or NBA TV. Anti-sports. Box Does the "three active streams" restriction include on-demand and recordings? Ben Nicholls Not too interested unless the provide more package options, or a la carte packages. Part of the reason I cut the cord was to stop paying for channels I don't watch. I would like to see at minimum a "no sports" package. ESPN is one of the most expensive channels and I don't like paying for it in a package when I don't watch it. An AndroidTV app is also a must. BinaryTB Google's Family Group system? Sounds like it won't support Google Apps for Work for people that actually pay Google already for their own domain. Add it to the list: Google Fi Google Play Music Family Plan Google Play Apps Family Sharing DirkBelig >"There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo." And what's preventing anyone from simply subscribing to HBO NOW or bundling Showtime or Starz for $9 with their Amazon Prime package? Anyone who would get this probably has a Netflix account and app, so I don't understand what the beef is here having to a la carte HBO other than it breaks the cable channel grid paradigm. #FirstWorldProblems thespacecowboy +ing a show also adds any on-demand shows to your library. Downside is those ones have ads, like Hulu. TV guide is frustrating. You can't easily see past the current show and the next one. EPG is weird. You can click on the channel name and then browse that actual channel, but not in a grid style. hp-fourtwenty Yes, we need a good epg severely!! Lex Lybrand It's not available on Android TV. That's a day-1 must-have. Sean McGeezer I'll wait for Cartoon Network at the very least, though it may not happen Terry Sanchez It does not have the Cooking channel and is lacking many channels. I hope this improves over time. SlingTV is still better right now. JG Is it steam only? Or can one pin content to their devices for local/offline play? Then I could​ save a recording or two to watch on my (non-driving) commute without having to worry about adding to much to my monthly bill at $10/gig. Or maybe save something for longer than the 9 month period. Google's Play Movie/TV app allows it, as does the new light weight version of YouTube being beta'd in India now. Netflix and Showtime do to... I would assume if they can do it, why not also YouTube TV? thespacecowboy No download option at the moment.

[Update: Official] Google Keyboard is now Gboard with v6.0 update—includes integrated search, dedicated number row, multiple active languages, and more [APK Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/12/17 2:10am PDTDec 17, 2016 80 Plus 1 on G+ 242 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares405 Applications Google News Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion. Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. It's not only a name change, though. There are a few important new features, including a search shortcut and true multi-language support. The update is still rolling out, and Google has not yet posted an official changelog. Here's what we've spotted so far. G button (enabled in settings) offers quick access to search from the keyboard Pop-out toolbar (when G button not enabled) provides access to themes, settings, one-handed mode, and search Optional dedicated number row Up to three active languages with preference for one (previously had to switch) Gesture typing is now called Glide typing. Search for emoji Rearranged emoji panel with group selection at bottom Emoji have bright halo effect around them GIF button is always shown, but disabled in apps without support. We'll update if we spot anything else, but this should be most of it. Keep in mind, the G button is optional because you can still access integrated search from the toolbar pop-out. It's just one extra step. It's up to you if you prefer to just have the button. That's cool and all, but the dedicated number row will make a lot more people happy. You have to turn that on in settings as well. Those on the team who speak multiple languages seem quite excited about the multiple language support too. You can actually type in up to three of them without manually switching keyboard modes. This is similar to the way SwiftKey does it. The update is just starting to roll out, but we've got the new version on APK Mirror (Android 4.2 and higher). Note, it's in a different area of APK Mirror than the old Google Keyboard, but it is just an update. Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion.

Fan guy Rita will be happy for that number row :P Someone iOS got it first couple months ago if I remember correctly. Brad "Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. " AbbyZFresh iOS users barely even use Swiftkey. Let alone Gboard. K.P. Smith Good info. Ryan should include that in the very first sentence of this article that your commenting on ... Marko Šaric Great. Now I'm smearing egg on my phone screen cause I can't wait until I finish eating. Downloaded. Robert Trance You could have used voice control if ON?!! Marko Šaric It's not a big deal. It got wiped off. Robert Trance What phone if i might ask...? Marko Šaric Nexus 5x. jesuguru Knuckles (for screen)? Fork and knife (for eggs)? Marko Šaric Hand for dipping bread in egg yolk. Dominic81 "multiple active languages" FINALLY!!! WORPspeed THIS!!! SO much this! I was excited for gboard, but lack of this was holding me back, but reading that it is now included, I can say ADIOS SWIFTKEY! Or maybe it doesn't work as good :P Swiftkey isn't bad, just excited about gboard :D motoridersd Same! I love SwiftKey, but it can do some annoying things from time to time. I'm definitely going to be check out this new Gboard. WORPspeed And I already switched back to swiftkey. The delete swipe gesture on gboard is just horrible, it should just delete 1 word per swipe, not every either 1 letter or the whole sentence.....needs an undo button. The layout...well I'm just used to Swiftkey's layout and the way swiftkey is smart enough to isnert a space after a comma....small things that make gboard a horrible experience for me. I do keep it around incase I want to sent a gif/meme image, it's easier switching keyboards then apps :D motoridersd Yeah, the placement of the question and exclamation marks on Gboard is awful. Too many taps to get to them (they're probably hiding behind another key, but I didn't go hunting for them). Not getting a space after a comma, or getting a space after a word when putting in a question mark was annoying. The delete gesture is definitely not good on Gboard. Jordan Long press m or n is too many taps for question marks and exclamation points? Or press and slide on the period key? They're all very easy to get to. Also the slide-to-delete action is great. I don't know of any keyboard that does it in a significantly better way. motoridersd Turns out I had the symbol setting turned off, so I didn't see any of the characters on the letters or the period. The slide to delete on Swiftkey works very well because it works on the whole keyboard, not just on the backspace key. I've been spoiled by just swiping anywhere to delete a typo. You have to disable flow typing for this to work, but I don't miss that feature. Zorkos You don´t need an undo button. After you delete something the deleted text will appear as a suggestion Urs Müller It also doesn't seem to predict the next word. Instead it shows options for the currently swyped word... Also back to Swiftkey for now. Rapper_skull My dream came true. Rod Our* Rod What? Like in Swiftkey? rauldzmartin Exactly. Mario Porfírio Souza I hope that feature works well, because in swiftkey dont work well HARAMBE It doesn't even correct italian words with some french shit! GLORIOUS Vincent Bye bye SwiftKey samiazza Can somebody explain how does this work? Georgiy Alexandrov I guess it will predict words for both languages depend on what you type in, without need of switching languages manually. Apps By Usman basically what swype provided years ago :) (it's good to see google adapt it) bat0nas Exactly. Been using multiple language in Swype for years. HaltestelleLuitpolthafen I text in both German and English, but 75% of the time in English. I don't have to go into settings and manually switch it from English to Germany anymore, I can have it do it on the fly and set it to prefer English since that is what I predominantly speak. Felix /Offtopic When I interpret your username right you're from Mannheim? Why do you speak English predominantly? ;) mitchilin You don't have to go into settings. Just press the world icon on the keyboard and it changes language instantly. I've been doing this for years with German. snoop doge what do you exactly mean by it? Ashish Bogawat It is a good start, but Swiftkey has quite a headstart with support for many more languages. It (Swiftkey) even does English & Hindi, even though they use different scripts. I type in English and it suggests matching Hindi words along with the English suggestions. Ash Google has that as well, but that keyboard is Google Indic keyboard prediscover no asian language support though :( Ash Hindi, Tamil etc are Asian language. Fir Chinese there is seperate keyboard prediscover I thought Hindi had a separate keyboard too jenderalcilik I too excited for this. I installed right away after reading that sentences. I mean I always loved Swiftkey, but sometimes I hate it when it loads so slow when I switch from app to app. I hope this worked well. Eddy Nelson Lopez This is so épico ahora puedo change languages sin tener que touch the world icono 😂😂 Total Insecurity Hahaha^^ Robert Trance LOL, you so won this thread.... Avishek Jajajajaja Lord Argyris One upvote, duly earned. El_Big_CHRIS My main reason for sticking to SwiftKey, maybe I'll finally ditch it iiku it is also available for chrome spellchecking. Vratislav Jindra "multiple active languages" I HATE IT SO MUCH!!! I've never used it on other keyboards which had this feature. When I'm tapping, the keyboard usually guesses the language correctly. But when I start the text with swiping, it's more like 50:50 - sometimes it guesses the correct word, but very often it also offers me a word from a different language. I'd rather keep pressing the "switch language" button on my keyboard to switch languages manually instead of relying on a technology which fails half the time. bidou I don't like it either. It always writes the wrong word from the wrong language. You can disable it in the keyboard options and go back to the normal "press the switch language icon" type. Vratislav Jindra You're right, I must have missed that setting. Thank you very much! Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez It's happening!! Aleluya! I've been waiting eagerly for this feature since Google Keyboard supports Gif images. Sorry Swiftkey but now is time to move on. HopTzop Too bad it doesn't work well, at least here it's a pain in the arse. Also sometimes doesn't get the whole sliding and gives just a letter, sometimes it gives a totally different word that has nothing to do with what you slide, but happens to start with that letter. They just made me buy Swype which feels like it's reading my mind and runs buttery smooth. Bewear ARM64 only :c aSquard http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-release/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-armeabi-v7a-android-apk-download/ Bewear Thanks. Brian ARM64 though :( Phoenix FUUUUDGE Andy Roid Whaaaa Adrianus AJ Nadeak There's an ARM version available. Michael Carr Can't say I'm a fan of the name change, but the new features sound cool. Downloading! Phoenix OMG is this really happening ? is this really happening ? FINALLY Carson Saldanha Ohh yeah... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif Phoenix I spoke too soon, it's still not happening for ARM owners lol just ARM64 Carson Saldanha Hopefully APKMirror will have the arm version soon. Artem Russakovskii Up now. Volodesi A number row? Finally. I can stop using SwiftKey. k0n And symbols hinting! I can have it set up almost exactly like SwiftKey now, but with added benefits and no extra app required :) FrozenHotChocolate Trying this right away!. But will still need a lot of improvements on the predictions front to pull me away from Swiftkey though. Michael Schaap Neat. Looks like it finally has most of the features I'm using Swiftkey for. (Number 1: multiple languages simultaneously – I tend to type in meerdere talen tegelijk; number 2: number row.) I guess I'll have to try it out and see if it beats Swiftkey yet. (Its prediction is still scarily accurate, though.) Rod It's been said here that it now supports multiple languages simultaneously. Michael Schaap Indeed. That's what I'm saying. Rod It's like a dream came true, until I saw the arm64 requisite.. Comediante "Optional dedicated number row" - It was about time! Only thing I miss is the hability to theme choosing colors (primary/accent) from a material color pallete and not just choose from a limited theme gallery. Jaime Andres Salame Borja Does it have Gif search? AdamH Yup, only works in Hangouts tho.. Artem Russakovskii Not only. In Messenger too. Badouken And Allo :P Abhilash Bingi Yup, but the app has to support it. Only Messenger and Hangouts do as of now. Rod No love for 32 bit. :( Baalinooo Not available for Nexus 6 then? :( Ten Bears not yet anyway... Rod Nope. CD RW ARM apk now available ntomka You don't have to wait for long. I got it through Google play update to my Honor 6 Plus, which is a 32bit phone. 😃 Rapper_skull Then upload the APK to APKMirror. EDIT: Never mind, it has already been uploaded. Rod Excellent news. Thanks! Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9835dd11c8683e36c4fcf70d1cd5c1ccbb48c6158a3019cd0c72fdcb6fce9949.gif Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif mx3 But no emoji prediction :( Caleb Lee ☹️ someone755 This guy does not use Gboard. cowboysfanzz Use Textra with Gboard it's heaven mx3 This has nothing to do with emoji prediction. cowboysfanzz Yes. Textra has emoji prediction XerBlade But it's a single SMS app, not something that magically adds stuff to the keyboard, so it doesn't help you in literally every other app on your device. wade_county I must be blind, where in the settings is emoji prediction in Textra? Corey Kinard If only Textra would use, or allow as an option, stock Android's quick reply in the notifications (where it sticks) and also added the stock inline reply option in heads up messages. It feels so cluncky to have their huge "quick reply" screen pop up now. I guess they could slim the app a bit by dropping the GIFs too since it's in Gboard. Marcus Clendenin You can search in the emoji keyboard. It's not as nice as the emoji prediction in Swiftkey but it does help when trying to find an emoji Cakefish Emoji search doesn't work for me. Just says "data for emoji search is not available". Weird. Checked permissions. Checked internet connectivity. Marcus Clendenin I saw a reddit comment that said the initial download needs to happen on WiFi? So maybe try doing that. I haven't been on WiFi today so I can't confirm whether that works Cakefish You sir, are a gentlemen and a scholar! Thanks! Jacques Ligier Can anyone confirm whether it works? Robert Trance I can predict for you... Marko Šaric Poll: What was your first search ever with gboard for android? AfrodanJ Pictures of Santa PHLAK What about gif support? Kyle Gospodnetich It's been there for months. Aaron I see it but it's crossed out here. Guess it only works on apps that support it. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, the button is now permanent, just disabled in app that don't support it, which is different than the previously confusing contextual GIF button. JSo You can now do a search with the keyboard which will pull up gifs in the results like it does by hitting the "gif" button. I tried it in Inbox but it inserts the link and not the gif itself. Anthony Castanza Its actually happening!! But what are we going to complain about now?! Oh wait, Allo. Nevermind. Michael Kennedy Fuckin' Allo... :( rauldzmartin Is it not killed by Google yet? Cesar Something something no sms fallback... Rapper_skull Multi-language is not exactly what I wanted. I now see IT - EN - ES, meaning that I will receive suggestions for Italian, English and Spanish. But what I really wanted was scrolling the spacebar to switch language, so that I can type Greek letters while writing. Unfortunately writing math will still be slow. Martin Can't you just tap the "change language" key? One tap, and there you have your Greek keyboard. Rapper_skull Nope, I also have other keyboards, so a lot of taps are needed. Martin I'm not talking about the "Change keyboard" button. I'm talking about the "change language" key next to the space key. You can enable it in the settings ("Show language switch key"), and it lets you cycle through your language with single taps. Rapper_skull Like the default Android button, it still cycles between keyboards. Martin That's strange. I have four different keyboards installed, and the language switch button only cycles through the different languages in Gboard for me. YouNex Long press number row for (some) Greek letters ! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad08d55f06a775a882ce447cac20fc395dae92cb2d45714f508054225311896c.jpg Rapper_skull Doesn't work for me :( YouNex Android version/GBoard version ? Rapper_skull Android 6.0.1, GBoard 6.2.18.151907649 YouNex I updated to GBoard 6.2.22 and it's gone. I think you'll need to downgrade to GBoard 6.1.x Android 7.1.1 btw YouNex As you may have noticed, the screenshot above doesn't have rounded letter keys, which means version below 6.2 YouNex My GBoard version was 6.1.71 to be exact Tomáš Petrík Can you disable all of the top rows? No suggestions, no numbers, no G button, no themes shortcut... Just make it gone. I can do that in current version. If that option is gone, I will hesitate to update. I value screen estate. mattcoz Yes Tomáš Petrík Thanks! Igor Stanić How? mattcoz Oh, I see now that it still shows a bar with everything turned off in some apps. I tried it from the search bar and it wasn't there. Sorry about that. Tomáš Petrík Sadly, the answer is no. mattcoz Right, as I mentioned in my followup reply. Jaime Andres Salame Borja I wanted to search GIFs in Whatsapp? then i believe Whatsapp has to add the search engine... :( AbbyZFresh No gif support. Back to Swiftkey. Naxx ENVY It does support gifs... press the emoji button and its at the bottom,. the app has to support them too though senor_heisenberg Awesome. I'm so glad this was an update and not a separate app. Maxr1998 "Introducing Google Type, a smart keyboard with Google Assistant, tied to your phone number, and without SMS support." Vincent Don't give them ideas.. Clawz114 "The emoji panel was causing confusion with our users, so we have seperated this from the Gboard and Google Type to it's own dedicated emoji app, Gemoji." T4rd Hope they fix the the space bar cursor moving gesture, as it rarely works for my on my 6P. Sometimes if I try it for 20-30 secs it'll eventually remember I had that feature checked and start moving the cursor, so it's basically useless. Cory S Yeah, its a little stiff. I like the way it works on Chroma. Dehaha1 I agree, it's largely useless on my Nexus 5. It usually works on my second or third attempt, however at that point it would have been faster to just tap where I needed to go. On my iPad Mini 2 using GBoard it works much better, though sadly not as flexible as what is built into the default Apple keyboard. (Though I can't give up using GBoard, the gesture typing is too useful) mattcoz Are you holding and sliding or just doing a quick swipe? T4rd Tried it both ways several times. But I see now that if I do a quick swipe, it seems to work better, but still kinda inconsistent and awkward to use. Like your finger has to already be swiping before you touch the space bar, which doesn't feel right. So I think they need to tweak this gesture to allow you to do it while holding in on the space bar for a split second before swiping at least, esp since that doesn't have any other function associated with it (at least in my config). mattcoz No, you should NOT be doing a quick swipe. You hold it down and slide your finger, don't lift it until the cursor is where you want it. If that's not working, then there's something wrong. Martin I don't know if I'm just lucky, but I got it to work on the new Gboard on every single try so far. Previously it would always bring up the "Change Keyboard" menu instead, no matter how fast or slow I tried swiping. Simon I agree this function works much better with this new update. Berkay Did they add the two new keyboard themes that were on the pixel? Badouken Yes it has the blue color schemes for standard light and dark themes. Berkay I went ahead and got the APK because I was impatient, thank you anyway :) How do I use the GIF functionality? It doesn't seem to work anywhere. JSo Only works in apps that support it. Google Messenger, Hangouts and Allo. App developers apparently have to enable it themselves Badouken Mine didn't work at first but then randomly appeared after awhile. It appears when I clicked the smile icon at the bottom, it would then show a gif button next to it. Berkay Whenever I use the emoji search, it's so laggy... But google keyboard has been laggy for me since they introduced the update where they added all those new features like one handed mode. Tiuri Elvander I saw saw a video showing that the iOS version could send little screenshots of search results. I can't find a way to do that in this version of am I missing something?? Lazyboy0172 unfortunately doesn't look like we're missing anything. whenever I search for something it shows a "share" button but just inserts the text from the result as well as http link for the search. It's not the worst, but I'd much prefer to insert it as an image, especially in apps that support the official api for image insertion from keyboard. I mean it's already there with gif search, so why not make those shared search results as pretty in my text message as they are on the keyboard? Still very happy to be able to search from keyboard though, and be able to search emoji. Goodbye, Dango. Goodbye, Swiftkey. Please keep improving, GBoard. Paul_Werner I wasn't using Swiftkey but I was just like you regarding Dango. Glad to have it a part of the built in keyboard now saf1927 The multi language support works really well with two languages. Haven't added a third yet, but now Swift Key is really obsolete for me. Christopher Robert Does it allow for keyboard size scaling? How about better prediction? Themes? yep still not a good replacement for Swiftkeye. Tuck Choate Yes, yes, and yes. They're in the settings. Good thing Swiftkeye has good autocorrect. It'd be embarrassing to make a typo that contradicts your point online. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Multiple active languages". That look a long ass time to happen. br_hermon I want to like Gboard but it's lack of secondary key functions keeps me using SwiftKey. Abhilash Bingi What do you mean by "secondary key functions"? If you mean typing symbols by long pressing alphabets, you can do it in Google Keyboard. br_hermon Thanks the heads up! I never knew that. It's disabled by default. I had to go into settings to enable it. epsiblivion not a fan of all this rebranding to G products. must be new internal management on the apps. Ben G products... like what? Except this one? Perry Mason Gmail /s Todd I really hate that they did it to their email app. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. bikrame Hey guys, how do i add that numerical line above on keyboard. JSo Settings>Preferences>Toggle Number Row bikrame There is nothing like that JSo Then maybe it didn't update for you. bikrame I just downloaded. Vorastra https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a256e9e1393428c03b73ef88560b8959247cf4df2fb8b4664a215b5763527b9a.png bikrame https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cb2c9e011ee1cbea13883ec8e56c4afa707debc7c253dac399b7fa0841d64ae7.png Vorastra Super weird. You're missing the whole "Keys" section. bikrame May be its because i don't have stock Android ??!! Georgiy Alexandrov You downloaded it from Play Store? Then I suggest you check version number, it should be 6.0.65 bikrame ok now its going to sound super weird. I did download from play store and it says like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/599303b5bf88aff23f000101544e9f9f626e9d31d3a791cf557f08a8bef2ddb1.png Georgiy Alexandrov It's not really that weird, update probably not rolled out to you yet. You will get it a little bit later (or just download apk from link in article). And you should actually check app version through settings>apps>gboard (if you not seeing Gboard in apps try to look for Google Keyboard) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eff26cc1692310ac42f8878e975697259b70c46702b63ed7fd373a8d67597b.png Kieron Quinn It's on staged rollout and hasn't reached you yet, use the APK Vorastra I'm not using stock android. Using an LG G4. Georgiy Alexandrov Settings > preferences > number row Alex Guitar This is mucho bueno for my Spanglish! Frisi *muy :P Frisi Bye Swiftkey. It's me or Swiftkey caused more "typos" than any other keyboard? Of course, Swiftkey would correct them, but I type better using Google's Keyboard. Now with multi-lingo support I'm more than happy. motoridersd I've been using SwiftKey for a long, long time since I have always needed two languages. I have not been using Flow since I live by the swipe to delete gesture. I love the SwiftKey prediction of emoji, I use it ALL the time, and I am very used to the layout of the keyboard. Trying Gboard for the first time, it feels odd, but it's easy to type in. It doesn't seem to always introduce the period after hitting space bar twice. Swiping the backspace key to delete a word is cumbersome because the surface is very small, so I'm missing that already. There is no emoji prediction, but the search is nice. Unfortunately it doesn't know the latest emoji like bacon, avocado or facepalm, but once they are in the recent window, this can be less of an issue. The prediction does not work in the search box, which is a shame, because searching Google without it is a PITA. Hurricane Andrew The prediction also does not work in Chrome or the Facebook search field. Big oversight. motoridersd Yeah, I use that a lot with SwiftKey. A new Gboard update just came through, wonder if they're tweaking these things. Christian yup and for this thing i still use swiftkey, is really helpfull the prediction in chrome ;) Freek Smulders This is pretty big! #NotMyPresident Why would you want an advertising company logging all your keystrokes? PVL_93_RU I'd rather trust them than my own government to do the same #NotMyPresident LOL. Okay..... /rolleyes 7-down It's in the settings. You can disable sharing of what you type. #NotMyPresident And if you believe that Google respects that, I've got a bridge to sell you. 7-down Hopefully it's the Golden Gate Bridge. I really like the way it looks. http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ec/ec23811e3ebf097d66addd31391d2b84d094eb85cc37a9b74dec3475a722ca0c.jpg XerBlade Gboard settings > Advanced > Disable "Share snippets" (if it really bothers you that much) P.S. It never actually logs all your keystrokes, even with that enabled. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I see how that could be a concern. They should've filtered the keyboard the way it is in iOS, since that would probably give a lot of people more peace of mind. For example, on iOS, you can't enter your password using Gboard for this exact reason. Whenever you have to enter a password or pin number, it automatically reverts back to the default keyboard (which doesn't store information) to prevent anything getting leaked. But, all in all, this version is pretty cool too. XerBlade ...Seriously, this isn't sending your passwords back to Google. Apple did things that way in iOS to prevent possible malicious third party keyboard replacements from taking advantage of that (which IS a concern in Android: seriously, you probably shouldn't go around installing random keyboards from people you've never heard of). This keyboard, being not-a-malicious-app and all, simply never includes anything marked as a password field in the "snippets" it sometimes [optionally] collects as statistical data for use in improving the app. Knowledgeborn Allah At least that's what they tell you... I'm not trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but we don't really know what's happening behind the scenes. Google is an advertising company, and their job is to know as much about you as possible. Statistical data is one thing, but personal information is something different. Another thing that separates the Android version from the iOS version is that the Android version is tied to your Google account, while the one on iOS functions independently. That's how, on Android, they can share "learned words" across your Android devices. They can filter these through your devices because, since they're tied into your Google account, what you type (or at least some of it) goes through Google's servers. It's not anonymous data to just improve the app. It's data specifically about you, tied to your personal account. PVL_93_RU So when the G button is active - how do you switch languages? Do you just tap the same key? Is there a gesture like swipe the spacebar (swiftkey)? Frisi You don't have to now since it will automatically "change" as you type. PVL_93_RU I don't like that XerBlade The G button is unrelated. By default, it has multiple languages active simultaneously (so you just type and it intelligently figures out which language you're using as it goes). Or you can manually switch languages by long pressing spacebar (was already a thing in Google Keyboard). OR you can enable the dedicated language switch button in the settings (was also already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar (note the optional G button is on the left side of the suggestions pane, so again, completely unrelated). PVL_93_RU >OR you can enable the language switch button in the settings (was already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar Phew, thank god Kwetsima Maluleke Number row? Finally! Nuno G. Gboard?! What were these guys drinking?!? raazman The good stuff. tim242 Nothing good about this POS. raazman You're entitled to your own opinion. To me, the best keyboard out there just got better. tim242 Yeah, because a blank bar taking up screen real estate is so much better. I'm glad you like it. raazman What blank bar? tim242 The settings bar, above the keyboard. raazman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2569deb1397c93e3c918c8e97290dbd8c70fafb66fa9d5277b20236aa34124a6.png Huh? What exactly are you talking about? tim242 That bar where you have suggestions. I don't use suggestions. If you disable suggestions, the bar remains as a blank bar. They do this on about every other version. raazman Ah ok, makes sense. I use the suggestions so I never had the need to remove it. Aaron Sounds like a personal problem. tim242 You sound like a blocked problem : ) Aaron Doesn't matter. You can't stop anyone from replying. Wis Ciao Swiftkey, this is soooo good - everything I wanted. Thx, Google... David Prieto What's with the emoji search? Why doesn't it return any results? JSo Emoji search is working for me. ADofCLE The number row is probably the only new feature I am going to use lol mattcoz Dedicated number row? Dedicated number row?! DEDICATED NUMBER ROW!!! Andy Roid Yes, that's what it says in the article mattcoz It sure does! Adrianus AJ Nadeak #DEDICATEDNUMBERROW yka1988 OMG finally! I just switched back to SwiftKey after months and months of using the super snappy Google Keyboard. Those were exactly the things I was missing, and especially the language features made me switch back recently. well, byebye Swiftkey, welcome back Gboard :) El Jefe this is great so now I can do GIF kb in Hangouts but only lif not via SMS. In the Google Messenger app, I can do GIF kb with SMS... I'm running latest everything 7.1.1 ahhh Jordan L I'm not seeing the G button on my Pixel XL. anyone else? I enabled it in settings. rebooting now. I also don't see any text predictions. the whole top bar is missing. EDIT: reboot fixed. XerBlade Make sure you're in an app that supports text predictions. It won't show up if you are typing in the Google search bar, for example. Bewear Emoji search not working for me. It might be because my device is set in Spanish. Scros97 A mi sí que me funciona en castellano la búsqueda de emoji! Bewear Not for me :/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a56c197ba6b723f6ccc0ba473c4dc94277e9cac70a07f5146133052155fdc1f8.jpg Kieron Quinn I have the same issue, apparently you have to be on WiFi at least once for it to download. Shame I won't be until tomorrow. keithzg See this is when it pays to have two devices, so you set one to be a wifi hotspot, then trade off ;) Kieron Quinn My Nexus 5X IS a hotspot, because my flat wifi is broken Ashwin I've installed the app on wifi, have been on wifi the entire day and also tried the same with the new update and still the same error persists for me. What do I do? Cakefish Same but my language is English :( alessiolarva No way to search images directly from the keyboard? tim242 Great. From 41, to 72 MB running service, and laggy again uggggh Aaron Really? Not seeing any lag here. Maybe it's your phone? Would be the first time a Galaxy experienced lag... tim242 Yeah, because a Galaxy chooses which versions of Google Keyboard to lag on. *Eye roll JSo No lag here either. It's not the update. Rod Actually it's showing up as 100mb ish for me. Alex Feels like they finally fixed the Google keyboard lag. That is my only gripe with my Pixel XL ahtough that problem was also on the 6p). Cakefish "Data for emoji search is not available." What does that mean? Samson Don't know. It works for me. Cakefish What phone do you have and which Android version? I have Nougat 7.0. Samson Much appreciated update. I like it a lot! Rod This is the official Google keyboard. Samson It is now. And the problem still exists. So I had to go back to the older version of the official Google keyboard. Very disappointing. Dustin Mingo Swipe from backspace is gone :( Georgiy Alexandrov It still there, or did you mean something else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/09a329c7a63ed9bb2bcdeec4f5376ebdb3d98d40b75e3f7e2788bf488a681485.png Dustin Mingo Setting's gone for me. I'll clear data and report back Georgiy Alexandrov That's good to hear JSo No it's not Rod It isn't. Steve Will they ever enable its auto-corrections/auto-suggestions when searching? Rocket Does anyone know what happened to picture background? JSo You mean in themes? It's still there Rocket On the old Google Keyboard you could select a picture as the theme, but it looks like its gone now. JSo It's still there for me. I don't know why it's not working for you Rocket Did you do it as an update or as a new installation?? JSo I installed the apk right over my existing app Rocket Im gonna reinstall Google Keyboard (and brave the clunky LG Keyboard) and then update to GBoard Rocket Got it working by selecting a theme and then updating. Now it's an option. Georgiy Alexandrov Working for me on 7.1 and 6.0 but not on 4.4. Well, that's weird Rocket I'm on 5.1 so maybe that has something to do with it? Corey Kinard You sure? I press the arrow on the top left of the Keyboard, press the pallet, and the first theme option for me in Gboard is the "My images" one Edit: way too late! Igor Stanić how to disable popup toolbar when g is not enabled???...it just takes up space...everything is fantastic except this freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still better Igor Stanić How to disable suggestion row ...i dont use it so it is blank...terrible Georgiy Alexandrov You can't, as far as i know tim242 Yep, they always fuck something up. I had to revert back. Igor Stanić Me too Archenuh How to you revert back this damn cancer of an app? Dave Okay, wow. This app somehow fucked up my Pixel XL. I've installed it and it always freezed and didn't let me close the keyboard anymore. So I force restarted where it got stuck. I've hold down the power button again to force restart and when it booted up I was set back to Android 7.1 (had 7.1.1) and I can't access recent apps, can get into the quick settings, have different system settings (for example it vibrates when pressing home although I had it disabled) and it doesn't get data connection. What is this? JSo I really don't think a little keyboard app could cause all that. The most that could probably happen is that the keyboard may keep force closing if you installed the wrong version but I don't think it would do all the things you said happened. Dave I don't know either. But that's how it went. Everything was working fine and after I've installed the keyboard and it kept freezing and therefore covering up half my display although I was on the homescreen I force restarted where it got stuck. One again force starting brought me to that situation I am in now. Zach Mauch LOVE LOVE LOVE the dedicated number row. I would also like the option to add a "tab" button to the keyboard. suavemezie No emoji predictions? JSo What are these emoji predictions everyone is bringing up? Georgiy Alexandrov A SwiftKey (or other keyboard) feature, something like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/045c7a98611e38f08413474280cb41eb8fd78121f38eae7386543f5cc4490eb2.png JSo Was this something that was shown by Google or that the GBoard on iOS has? Just seems everyone is bringing this up all of a sudden. Georgiy Alexandrov Idk, but I dont remember Gboard having this on iOS. I guess it just a popular feature that many custom keyboards have. DubeBoom While Gboard feels much faster and more fluid, there are some things I just like about Swiftkey like the easy access to ? and !. But I'll try using Gboard for a few days to see if I get used to it. JSo Turn on "Long Press For Symbols" for easy access to those. Ashish Bogawat I have that option, but with Swiftkey you don't even need to long-press. Just swipe left on the '.' key. Seems small, but is super efficient once you get used to it. mattcoz Another quick method is to swipe from the symbol key, see if that works for you. Adrianus AJ Nadeak It's not as easy on a wide phone like the Nexus 6. mattcoz True Rod Decrease the long press delay, set it to 120ms. It'll make your life easier. Arshdeep Singh Saini It doesn't install 😢 Nathan J Aww. Google Keyboard's growing up. It was always my favorite keyboard on Android, even though it lacked some features of other keyboards. It was accurate which is what I liked. "Gboard" is a downgrade. On iOS, the Gboard autocorrect is just off the wall. Microsoft's Flow Keyboard (did y'all get that yet?) is better for trace typing, but it will not learn new words. No curse words, no proper names... gotta tap that out. So I deal with Gboard since it will learn... but not from its mistakes. It might be a limitation of iOS, but Gboard on iOS is vastly inferior to Google Keyboard on Android. Coming from someone who has used both extensively. Craig Nelson I have both myself and you're right the auto correct on Gboard IOS is not as good as IOS native keyboard but I will say that the Gboard on IOS seems slightly better than the one on android when it comes to the fluidity of finding a search result and using it. Max Not a second-copy-of-the-same-app? S**t what's happened Google? mrjayviper finally catch up to iOS. Thanks google. I'll be enjoying this on my note4 as I've been doing on the Air2 and 6s+ itsatrap Its good but still no better than Swiftkey. Not even close. jl2222 ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You can perform google search in Swiftkey? Find a gif without leaving the keyboard? itsatrap Those things are extras, keyboards are for typing. Swiftkey is still far better at it. On top of that, there is this annoying bug: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 Rod I agree. Swiftkey still has the lead. Azzy Fuck, only 3 languages at a time! Luckily SwiftKey can accommodate 5, just the number I need! Rod You speak 5 languages? Not bad! steb0ne Finally NERV I am still waiting for it to include those Asian languages so I don't need to download a worse separated one. xunknownx finally! been waiting for the google keyboard to have a dedicated number row. Albin Does it record keystrokes? Rod Of course. Machine learning is a thing. Umer Farooq It now also supports Urdu swiping and suggestions. Vincent Goh Asian languages? I need English, German, and Chinese. I don't need multi languages to include Chinese, but I don't want to switch keyboard app whenever I need to type Chinese. pfmiller Might be more realistic for them to add better English and other Latin alphabet language support to the Pinyin keyboard. I can understand them not wanting to clutter up their main keyboard with various input methods. Ramiro Fernandez I noticed something, don't know if it's new to this version but pretty sure it is. The keyboard will sometimes now correct *back* one word if the next word you type changes what it would predict. So I typed "I'm feeling" but when I typed "I'm" it detected it as "on". Then after typing "feeling" it changed the "on" to "I'm". Gave me options for the two word suggestion too (see screenshot). Doesn't always happen, I guess it depends on how close I was with my gliding and how confident it was with the original prediction. I've never seen this before, but it's really clever. I wish it would take context into account better when suggesting words in general. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f788aeb53d108efe429fbde31f0cead3ef3ecba862432200ee25bd8e1eecf969.png Rod Yeah, I noticed it yersterday whilst replying to a Reddit comment. itsatrap Do you guys have this problem: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/sxhRXvLfILk WesleySmalls Have they learned nothing from the IE6 toolbars? benjammin03 I am waiting for the google keyboard to have the swipe left to delete the last word. After using it on Swiftkey, it's impossible to use a keyboard without it. Portgas D. Ace Gboard does have this option. benjammin03 I think I tried this before, but I couldn't get used to having to start at the delete key. I'm used to being able to swipe left from anywhere. I forgot about it though, so I'm going to give it another shot since this is the only reason I still use Swiftkey. Thanks! Portgas D. Ace I used Swiftkey in the past but never gestures. So I had no idea it works differently there. Rod In Gboard, you'll need to swipe from the backspace key. But, it's more effective, as you can delete a 10,000 word text all at once. Portgas D. Ace https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/751b4dcb558130893fe4db757a19aa363e250b3b3f2f347889f55783a469ef98.png Rod Swipe horizontally from the backspace key, and you can even delete the whole text at once. Faheem Ahmed not available in 4.2+ Promethean Add Swypes select all/copy/cut/paste gestures and I'm sold, I use them a lot more than I thought and missed them from other keyboards. Jack Sparrow I find it very buggy. It shows only one result. No horizontal scrolling like on iOS. And the funny thing is, if you search for "gboard", it returns the result for slash keyboard! Is it just me or is everyone facing the issue? Rod What do you mean, horizontal scrolling? Savage Alien "Emoji have bright halo effect around them" Yeah, whose bright idea was this? It doesn't look very pretty. QeeYou i know right 😂, looks very bad in bright themes'. neonix One more new feature I noticed: you can now edit the current theme. I believe previously, you couldn't make changes once the image was set. Dobriy Her Still not available in Turkish play store keithzg Oddly enough, the Play Store is still reporting this to me as Google Keyboard, but showing the version to be 6.mumble, while if I go into Settings -> Languages & Input -> Virtual Keyboards I see Gboard. Portgas D. Ace I get it listed as Gboard the Google keyboard in the updates list and as Google keyboard in the play store listing. dylan-m So, anyone else finding the emoji keyboard uniquely irritating now? They're wasting a ridiculous amount of vertical space, they have *two rows* of tabs, and the bottom row of tabs appears where the space bar is (while the emoji key is right beside the comma key). I frequently end up looking at the plain text smileys keyboard because I happen to miss the comma key while I'm typing. (They probably shifted the keys over by a few pixels again). That would have been fine with the old keyboard because the key to go back was in the exact same place. Now you have to pause and look for it because *the entire layout suddenly changes*. Also, they only have three tiny squashed little rows for the actual emoji, which is as many rows as they have for chrome. It's completely terrible. It would not be hard to flip that first row of tabs to the top, squeeze the search button beside them (because it doesn't need to be a text box and they can probably kill a category or two), and maintain a consistent layout for the bottom row of keys. Anyway, this is the second time in six months they have made significant changes to the keyboard layout, unexpectedly screwing with peoples' muscle memory. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by Google any more, but, it's pretty bad form. Ashwin "Data for emoji search is not available" error when tryed to search emoji...Anyone else with the same error?? Even updated to 6.0.68 (first update after Gboard 6.0.65)...Still no luck...Guys, someone please help!! please Does anyone know how the f I can disable the stupid toolbar? I HATE it, it just takes up space and I'll never use it. Any drastic measure to get rid of it works for me. Archenuh I really need this as well. What the fuck is wrong with them adding that fucking stupid toolbar above the keyboard and not letting us DISABLE it?! please how to disable toolbar LOL How does active languages work? I don't get it Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms... LOL So it only works with Latin alphabet? Rod No, those were examples. The app description on Play Store says it covers over 120 languages. LOL But I cant just write a sentence in English and then throw a word from a different language. To write anything in different language I MUST switch keyboard to that language in order to use that alphabet Rod I have English and Brazilian portuguese set, and I can start a sentence in portuguese, throw in some english words and finish in portuguese, and it will auto-correct all the words automatically. I don't need to tinker with anything at all. Just like in Swiftkey. LOL That's because Brazilian uses Latin alphabet. Its impossible to type a word in a different language if it's not Latin Rod Oh, I never tried another language that doesn't use latim alphabet. My bad. Scorpiax7 How does the "multiple active languages" thing works? i need an explanation, please -.- <3 Dmytro Gulivatyy If you have multiple similar languages installed you can type in both without switching and it will understand which one you meant. It should display the languages that are used on the spacebar key below. Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms. Dmytro Gulivatyy Does anyone know why we're getting it so late? I remember people protecting Google not releasing it on Android because we had G Now on tap but I'm confused now. Mako g now on tap is somewhat hidden in Pixels, so this is a good alternative Dmytro Gulivatyy I know and I agree, but why hold out for months before finally releasing it here kinda saying "Hey, you guys can have it too, don't worry we haven't forgotten." Just feels like it. Mako yeah, I really don't know why it took so long Dmytro Gulivatyy Less resources? Harder to code for? I mean it's their OS. Maybe they didn't care enough because it's easier to search for something with the search bar always accessible, GNow on tap here, and they weren't in such a hurry. But now they come out saying this is a better way. Sometimes i cant understand their behavior. pfmiller Android already has plenty of easy ways to access Google search, so it probably wasn't a big priority. Mwikarago Christian Why doesn't auto suggestion work in chrome search bar? Any idea? Dmytro Gulivatyy It's always been like that. I don't know for sure if i'm right but i think it's because they don't want to mess up your query because it's a browser address field. Same goes for the Google search bar. They think you will want full control over what you're typing because it can get technical, unlike the usual chats you have with people in chat apps. It sometimes offers predictions itself but not always. One of the reasons i'm still with SwiftKey. Mwikarago Christian That's a weird decision on their part. The only time I need autocorrection is in the address /search bar as I usually search using recurring words. That's also the reason I'll stick with SwiftKey Dmytro Gulivatyy Yes, it's been discussed times and times again and even listed as a bug https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 but i personally don't think it's one, they would've fixed it a long time ago. For what its worth i don't understand their reasoning either, you can still type and have it write what you meant and not autocorrect it but i also have other reasons to stick with SwiftKey(one being its better at autocorrecting something when GBoard thinks it was just gibberish and has no clue) but it's getting better and has its charm too. marclee Yes it has been always like this.. I kind of understand why Google wants autocorrect disabled in chrome address bar (not agree tho), I just can't understand it is disabled in Google search bar and YouTube..... Rod That's disabled in the app. Someone on Reddit revealed the code. Pedro Diego Fernández It seems I'm the only one having problems with the keyboard...sometimes I glide I can see it's writing the word I want but when I finish it just adds a letter... and the multiple active languages is too funky to use... had to switch back to aosp :( Navin Govindani Not a big fan of the initial release as it has many problems with Spanish, doesn't suggest anything with "ñ", hell it even tries to autocorrect anything I type with it, not to mention, the occasional lag, I understand it's an initial release but please get your shit together team! MikeOxlong The versions available on apkmirror are old (6.0.65). I currently have 6.0.69 on my 6p and pixel XL direct from the play store... Rod Contact Artem, maybe you can share your apk with them? SyCoREAPER Why does the Google Keyboard fdiffer from the AOSP one? Rod AOSP version is outdated and missing the newer features. It's a bare-bones version. SyCoREAPER Aosp in my opinion is functionally superior with the long press symbols for every key Rod That's also present in Gboard. SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it. pfmiller That's an option in Gboard SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it s427 I think I'll make the switch from Swype to Gboard for good now. The only thing still missing IMO are the gesture shortcuts (copy, cut, paste, select all, change capitalization), which are super useful in Swype. So, GOOGLE IF YOU'RE LISTENING YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO! dk mke That and the exclamation and question mark short cuts as well. By far the best features of any keyboard IMO. It's why I keep going back. Rod As a long-time Swiftkey user, I deeply miss the punctuation auto-spacing. drcaveman Anyone else having the GBoard just randomly stop accepting input? I fix it by hiding and clicking the text input box again. Seems to happen more frequently in messaging apps. freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still way better than this new Google keyboard. First of all, SwiftKey is better with word predictions. Secondly, SwiftKey has emoji predictions and Google keyboard does not. And lastly, the SwiftKey emoji list of emojis scrolls down📜 very smooth and fast. But instead in the Google Keyboard that same emoji list scrolls through multiple horizontal pages instead. It's very slow and takes forever if you are texting. Mace Moneta Still no control, alt or tab key (even just the option in advanced setting would be nice), which is annoying for those of us that ssh into systems. marrecar Ok I updated the app this morning and it completely broke it. No words show up on prediction bar, double space doesn't add a dot, can't delete by swiping to the left, can't move the cursor by swiping the spacebar. Plus the emoji menu looks awful. Does anyone have the same problem? I tried deleting data first, didn't work, then I replaced it with stock version, updated and still the same. obk88 very intrigued by gboard used it for 5 days went back to swiftkey...typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying, gliding isnt as smooth and better emoji experience on swiftkey...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure Christian Wagner Jr Still too large of a keyboard. I have a Nexus 6P and with it on its smallest setting, the keyboard and the box above it take up just under half my screen! SE.Quence so what? just resize it in settings Christian Wagner Jr I did. Its set to the smallest setting. Went thru all the settings as well. If they only gave the option to make it smaller by one or 2 more sizes, I would dump swiftkey for this no problem. Not all of us have donut fingers and need keys THAT large SE.Quence Yep, I can agree that some of other keyboards can be smaller when set to smallest size. But setting GKB to lowest height is pretty decent IMO. Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Can u help me with this? Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature sachouba It only took Google 3 years to add some features available on Samsung's keyboard and SwiftKey. And Google fans sound astonished... patrick yes i had the numbers row on my S4 stock samsung keyboard. but as far as autocorrection, i always found Google keyboard to be more accurate. SE.Quence Testing new GBoard on my 2 Nexus devices. Both running 7.1.1. Dictionary sync doesnt work even when account is set and sync was forced manually. By some reason, GBoard is not presented in Google sync settings (Accounts - Google) but IDK whether it should be here. Who else is facing this? Đức Thành I've been using the APK since a few days ago and autocorrection is still as horrible as ever, especially for Vietnamese. There's no options to set the aggressiveness level of autocorrection, and it's a pain in the neck to hit backspace multiple times for every sentence I type just to go back and fix the incorrectly autocorrected words. Not to mention Gboard now tries to autocorrects whole compound words and phrases, and every time I want to say: "Yo Google keyboard, I appreciate the effort but honestly you are not doing that well since you don't know the language or how I type that well, and your ultra aggressiveness in helping me is creating more trouble than it solves, so could you stop?" In the end just now I had to turn off autocorrection altogether, and now I have to face the problem of not having autocorrection for either language. I wish there were some middle grounds, but Google is too stubbornly extreme in its ways sometimes. Sigh. dhamp2g Vietnamese? ?? Honestly dude, English only ..... LMAO it corrects English well 😂😂 Đức Thành I'm afraid I don't fully comprehend what you mean. Yes it autocorrects English very well, but it has also started supporting autocorrection for Vietnamese since Google Keyboard 5.0, and that's my native language so there's nothing wrong with using that, and since the app itself officially supports the language... Arrgh forget it, you won't get it anyway. dhamp2g I understand , I was just saying all us english speaking folk only car about english problems LMAO :) mizrulez I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't turn off the keypress pop-up in the latest update. I tried deleting data, but the option is still not there. I find the popups extremely annoying. 😏 ggggg Something extraordinary happened. Google updated Google Keyboard instead of creating another keyboard App. mwolverine i wish it would show suggestions when searching in google apps. I usually end up going back to swype because of this. Usman Nagi Only reason I am not upgrading is that I miss the no key delay feature. Is there any way to enable in this current build? It slows my typing down and I only type better with popups. Itchy_Robot Why don't they just put Google Assistant into this keyboard? Renan At least that hideous G button is optional tigerberry Oh hey, finally there's gesture typing for Hungarian! It only took... well, how many years? Too many, considering that other keyboards, even OEM keyboards have been able to do it since ages. And lemme check... yep, still no gesture typing for Japanese in QUERTY mode. Come on Google, even Huawei's keyboard can do it! (I miss the Xperia keyboard. :( I wish it was available for non-Sony phones...) Gwaur I wish there was a way to completely hide the extra row where that G icon is. I found a setting for hiding the icon but the row stayed. It's a goddamn waste of space for someone who's not gonna use it. Fahad Ahmed Why there's no Chinese language included??? That's disappointing. Természetjáró Gayboard. Sorry, I'll show myself out... Patel Nisha I would be happy with a backspace key! Or better still, when using a stylus, thus knowing I went to each letter precisely when swaping, the damn thing would input my entry versus some substitute word! Marco Reali I love GBOARD but two things are very very frustrating: 1. There is no suggestion bar when typing in Chrome. 2. The language switch takes to long to recognise which language I'm typing. I wish they woul reinstate the button for those who want that. I switch language pretty often and I find it horrible to have to re-type words over and over before it's in the right language. WestIndiesKING anyone else getting a little bit of lag when you first start it up after a while of not pulling up the keyboard? I am getting 1-3 seconds of lag before it starts only if i havent used it in a while, after that it flies. Pixel XL 128gb Daddyo Gordon Am I the only one who feels the google keyboard has gotten bloated and too big? There should be an option to keep it at one language, as pioneered by monolingual on the mac (gets rid of a couple Gb of unused languages that waste storage).

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel.

Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch. That's my favorite thing a out keep being my grocery list.

Live feed Show 8.04pm EDT 20:04 So one of the longest quests in the history of golf comes to an end. Sergio Garcia: major champion! Congratulations, Sergio! Happy birthday, Seve! Sergio García wins the Masters after beating Justin Rose in dramatic play-off Read more Updated at 8.05pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.55pm EDT 19:55 The Tao of Sergio: “In the last few years I made my peace with the course, and accepted what Augusta gives and takes. And because of that, I am able to stand here today.” And with that, a beaming Willett helps the winner of the 81st Masters Tournament on with his new jacket, and the two embrace warmly. Try watching that without a tear in the eye! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.51pm EDT 19:51 Sergio speaks! “It’s been such a long time coming. I thought I had it on 18. But I knew I was playing well. I felt the calmest I’ve ever felt on a major Sunday today. Even after making bogey I was positive, I still believed. I hit some good shots, and I’m so happy. It is amazing to do this on Seve’s 60th birthday, and to join him and Jose Maria Olazabal, my two idols in golf, my whole life, it’s something amazing. Jose sent me a text on Wednesday night telling me he believed in me. My fiancée, my parents and her parents, they’ve all been so supportive.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.47pm EDT 19:47 To the Butler Cabin, where Danny Willett is on hand with a certain someone’s brand new jacket! Sergio enters with a smile as wide as the room. First, a word with the low amateur Stewart Hagestad. “It’s such a blessing to be sitting here with such a worthy champion.” There’s a lot of love in the air. Has the atmosphere in this famous old cabin ever been so giddy? And then a word with the new champion... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.45pm EDT 19:45 And now here’s a word from the runner-up Justin Rose. “There is a consolation that Sergio has won. He’s felt like I’ve felt many, many times, so it’s hard not to feel good for him. I felt like I had it wrapped up at one point. When Sergio was in the trees on 13 it looked pretty good! But this course offers an opportunity for people to make a comeback, and he did. I felt I got virtually everything right. I’ve had my fair share of great things that’s happened to me, I’m sure there’s going to be many more in the future. If there was half a chance [of making the green in the play-off] given it was Seve’s 60th birthday today, I’d have given it a go!” Yep, a true gent. Commiserations to Justin. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.40pm EDT 19:40 But spare a thought for poor old Justin Rose. Like Sergio, he carded 69 today in a mano-a-mano maelstrom! His was every inch a champion’s performance too, but somebody had to lose. He’s got the thousand-yard stare going on, but like the true gentleman he is, he’s quick to warmly embrace Sergio and congratulate him. Once that’s done, though, he’s lost in the crowd as Augusta erupts around him. What a day’s golf. What a tournament this has been! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.37pm EDT 19:37 Has there ever been a happier champion? He squats down for a second, before letting out a primal scream of delight. He embraces his partner, and howls again in wonder. Five years ago, he admitted that he thought he would never win a major. But now look. We’ve waited so long for this ... since the 1999 PGA, to be exact. And now he’s done it! These are some of the most emotional scenes ever seen at the 18th at Augusta ... and the old place has seen some action! Updated at 7.37pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.33pm EDT 19:33 SERGIO GARCIA WINS THE 2017 MASTERS TOURNAMENT!!! He sets himself, and taps his putt down the green. The ball thinks about lipping out on the left, but it loops around the back, and slo-o-o-o-o-owly drops. Sergio’s done it! After all this time, all those near misses, all the heartbreak ... he’s done it! Sergio Garcia ... is the Masters champion!!! A major winner. Sergio Garcia reacts after making his birdie putt on the 18th green to win the Masters. Photograph: Matt Slocum/AP Updated at 8.03pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.30pm EDT 19:30 Rose paces around his par putt, checking all angles. This has to drop, surely, if he’s to retain a chance of winning the Masters. He strokes it at perfect pace, but it’s always missing on the low side. And now Sergio has two putts to win the Masters! He loops around his putt a couple of times. He blows out hard. He steps up, draws his putter back, and... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.27pm EDT 19:27 Rose knocks his third pin high. He’ll have a 12-footer straight across the green for his par. He’ll be putting first, so he at least has the opportunity to make his par and put pressure on Sergio’s putt. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.25pm EDT 19:25 Rose’s ball has come back towards the fairway. But it’s still on the pine straw, and the branches of a nearby tree are in the way. He can’t get to the green, so he just takes his medicine and chips out. Advantage Sergio, who fires another fine iron towards the pin! That one stops about ten feet past, a little to the right. He’ll have another putt to win the Masters, unless Rose holes out from the fairway. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.20pm EDT 19:20 On Sky, Paul McGinley points out that Sergio’s putt was “right down a fault-line and was never an easy putt ... even from that distance it double-broke”. That won’t stop Sergio feeling pretty bad about letting that elusive major slip through his fingers. He looks a little miserable as he takes to the 18th tee again. Rose looks much more chipper. Especially when he wins the honour. He unsheathes the driver ... and sends it into the trees down the right. He gets a lucky break again, in so much as the ball ricochets back out from deep inside the thicket. But it’s only so much luck: he’ll still have a tricky line in from there, if he has one at all. Sergio sends a fine fade around the corner, and he’s in much the better position. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.12pm EDT 19:12 The pair smile and throw their arms around each other as they leave the green. So they’re going to a play-off. Rose will be the more relieved; Sergio will relive that missed putt until the end of time if he doesn’t win it. While they prepare for that, this is how we got here: -9: Rose, Garcia -6: Schwartzel -5: Kuchar, Pieters -4: Casey -3: Chappell, McIlroy -2: Scott, Moore -1: Matsuyama, Henley, Koepka, Fowler, Spieth E: Kaymer, Stricker Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.07pm EDT 19:07 Sergio has a putt to win the Masters ... and it dribbles off to the right! A little push, and his chance is gone. For now. A par for Sergio as well, and they’ll be going back to the 18th tee for the first sudden-death play-off hole. What a miss, though. Doug Sanders territory? No, not quite, it was a tricky downhill one. Not far off, though. How it’ll be viewed in the future depends on what happens next. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.04pm EDT 19:04 Rose has an eight-foot right-to-left slider across the green. Sergio’s is half the distance, but downhill and slippery, and therefore missable, especially under this pressure. Rose hits his putt ... and slips it by the right! He leans back and opens his mouth to gasp. Just a par! And Sergio has a putt to win the Masters! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.01pm EDT 19:01 Both men have short irons into 18. Rose sends his a little to the right, but he enjoys a huge stroke of luck: the ball bounces off the bank near the bunker to the right and turns towards the hole, eight feet from the flag! Sergio responds by arrowing his ball straight over the flag, and screeching it to a halt three feet behind! This is beyond astonishing. Rose to putt first. Are we to see a repeat of 16? “I can/can’t/can/can’t watch!” says Rich Fulcher. “I don’t want to do this anymore,” adds Ian Truman. “Can we all agree to turn it off? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.56pm EDT 18:56 Sergio splits the fairway at 18. Rose follows him down there. There’s nothing between these two amazing, talented, brilliant and brave players! Such a shame that one of them has to lose: either way we’ll have a worthy Masters champion, either way we’ll feel a pang of bittersweet anguish for the loser. What a game is golf! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.53pm EDT 18:53 Rose splashes out from the sand to six feet. That’s a fine shot looped high into the air and landed softly on the fast green. He’ll have a great chance to make his par. Sergio doesn’t hit his birdie effort at all; never going in. It’s a couple of feet short. Then Rose lets his short par putt drift wide right of the cup! Bogey, and after Sergio cleans up, they’re all square again! -9: Rose (17), Garcia (17) Rose hits from the bunker on the 17th. Photograph: Charlie Riedel/AP Updated at 7.04pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.50pm EDT 18:50 Turns out there’d been a Dustin Johnson / Lexi Thompson style rules brouhaha brewing in the background! When Sergio dropped on the pine straw at 13, he removed a nearby loose stalk. Did the ball move as a result? It’s been ruled that it didn’t - and the slow-mo pictures certainly seem to back that up - so no controversy here. But they’ve put it out there for the sake of transparency. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.46pm EDT 18:46 Rose gets a free drop from a sprinkler head, and though he has to stay in the first cut, he benefits from an improved lie. But he doesn’t take advantage, dumping his second in the deep bunker guarding the front of the green. Sergio lashes his second straight at the flag, over the trap Rose is in, and onto the putting surface. He’ll have an uphill putt from 30 feet for birdie. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.43pm EDT 18:43 Oh Sergio, why didn’t you commit to that putt?! His first really poor stroke of the day. Old-school Sergio returns at exactly the wrong time. But Rose really stepped up to the plate there; a real matchplay combination after Sergio sent in his tee shot. Moments of brilliance which may well have won him the Masters. He’s such a fine player. Still, Sergio can’t be giving up yet; there are two holes to play on Masters Sunday, and anything is possible. Rose’s drive down 17 leaks off to the right a bit. He’s in the first cut. Sergio blasts his down the middle. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.37pm EDT 18:37 Rose takes his time over his putt. As he should. He clips it up the green, outside the right of the cup, and curls it back into the hole! A perfectly judged putt! What a stunning birdie, and what a response to Sergio’s eagle! He moves to -10, in the lead again. Can Sergio join him? He doesn’t take so much time ... and prods a tentative effort towards the cup. It dies to the right, and that’s just a par. Oh Sergio! “I was hoping Sergio could make this year’s heartbreak more stylish and sophisticated,” writes James Ferguson. “He is doing a good job of it so far. Just the right amount of false hope. This one is really going to hurt, isn’t it?” I’m saying nothing. -10: Rose (16) -9: Garcia (16) -6: Schwartzel (F) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.33pm EDT 18:33 This is astonishing! Sergio lands his ball ten feet past the flag. It turns back towards the cup. It’s not quite on the correct line like Matt Kuchar’s ace, but it isn’t far away. Six feet to the right. Rose picks up the gauntlet and arrows his straight at the flag. It stops eight feet short. What a pair of tee shots under ludicrous pressure! Garcia hangs out a flat palm, and his friend Rose slaps it. What a sweet moment in the midst of battle! Great sportsmanship. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.30pm EDT 18:30 Rose strokes a lovely 50-foot putt to the right side of the hole. He’ll still have a three-footer for his birdie. But first Sergio. He rolls his eagle effort towards the cup. It’s pretty straight. It’s on line, but has he hit it?! For a second, it looks like he hasn’t, but it topples in at the last and that’s his first eagle in 452 holes at the Masters! And what a time to make it!!! Wow! Garcia does a little Seve-style punch and skip on what would have been the great man’s 60th birthday, as the crowd explode in happy turmoil! Rose does amazingly well to keep his head amid the tumult and make his birdie. This is back on! Schwartzel, incidentally, sunk a 25-footer on the last for birdie and a 68. He’s the new clubhouse leader! -9: Garcia (15), Rose (15) -6: Schwartzel (F) Garcia reacts after putting in for an eagle on the 15th. Photograph: Matt Slocum/AP Updated at 6.39pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.25pm EDT 18:25 ... he arrows a 7-iron pin high to 14 feet! What a shot! Actually, that hit the flagstick and bounced away. So close to albatross, the Gene Sarazen de nos jours. But what a chance for eagle! First up, though Rose from the fringe. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.21pm EDT 18:21 Sergio batters a monster drive down 15. After looking so shaky off the tee through Amen Corner, he seems to have found some renewed confidence. That ludicrous par escape on 13, coupled with Rose missing his birdie chance, probably helped. But his Masters bid looked pretty much over when he was taking his penalty drop in the bushes. Now, it’s a live prospect again. But Rose splits the fairway too, then finds the fringe on the left-hand side of the green with his second. Safe and dry. The pressure’s on Sergio, hitting over the water. And... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.16pm EDT 18:16 Sergio makes his birdie putt on 14! That’s just reward for his excellent second, and now the pressure’s on Rose to make his par putt, having lagged up to five feet. But he takes a deep breath and rolls a slight right-to-left slider into the cup! What steel! Par, and he remains a shot clear of his playing partner. Meanwhile Schwartzel takes two putts for par on 17, then finds Lyle’s Bunker with his drive down the last. -8: Rose (14) -7: Garcia (14) -5: Kuchar (F), Pieters (F), Schwartzel (17) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.13pm EDT 18:13 Paul Casey birdied the last, incidentally, to sign for a 68. He finishes the week at -4, and for the third year in a row will finish in the top ten. At 39, he’s still got time on his side to claim a green jacket. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.11pm EDT 18:11 Rose can only find the front left of 14. The ball threatens to trickle a little closer to the hole, but it doesn’t move much and he’ll have a 35-footer across the green for his birdie. Sergio responds by landing his ball pin high, 25 feet to the left of the flag. The green gathers the ball towards the hole, and he’ll have an eight-footer for birdie. Meanwhile up on 18, Pieters takes two putts for par, that’s a 68, and he joins Kuchar in the clubhouse lead at -5! “I know it was supposed to be Sergio Garcia Day (again...), but it really is hard to dislike Rose,” says Matt Dony, who can speak for me. “Understated consistency, nice-guy demeanour, world-class talent. If Sergio Sergio’s it up, I hope Rose holds on.” -8: Rose (13) -6: Garcia (13) -5: Kuchar (F), Pieters (F), Schwartzel (16) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.06pm EDT 18:06 Rose takes his frustration out on the little white dappled thing. Blam! He splits the fairway at 14. Sergio follows him down there. Up on 18, Pieters finds prime real estate with his tee shot, then sends a fine second shot 15 feet past the flag. A chance, albeit a curly one, for a final birdie that would set a new clubhouse lead. And on 17, Schwartzel finds the green in regulation, but he’s facing a tricky 25-footer for birdie. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.01pm EDT 18:01 Sergio fires three from out of the bushes, then wedges brilliantly to six feet. Rose will be kicking himself, then, for sending his second through the back of the green. A long, long putt from the fringe, up the bank and over a ridge, then down towards the hole. The best part of 30 yards. And he gently sends an exquisite putt three feet past the cup! For a second, that threatened to drop for eagle! Then... is this another turning point? Sergio knocks in his par putt, while Rose lets his tiddler slip to the left of the hole! Absurdly, both men are walking off the hole with par! And while all that drama was developing, Pieters pars 17, Schwartzel 16. They’re not going anywhere! -8: Rose (13) -6: Garcia (13) -5: Kuchar (F), Pieters (17), Schwartzel (16) -4: Fowler (14) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.55pm EDT 17:55 While Kuchar was acing 16, McIlroy landed his tee shot four feet from the flag and made birdie. It was his last of a round of 69, his best of a disappointing week. He’s -3 and he’ll have another top-ten finish at the Masters on his CV. But it’s not what he’s after, is it. Rory McIlroy tips his hat on the 18th. Photograph: Chris Carlson/AP Updated at 6.04pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.52pm EDT 17:52 Yes, Sergio has indeed sent his drive at 13 into bother. Under a bush! He’s forced to take a penalty drop, and it’s all unravelling for the poor man. Pieters meanwhile splashes out of the bunker at 16 to six feet, but his par putt breaks off to the left on its last turn, and that drops him back to -5. This is beginning to look very promising for Justin Rose! But on the other hand, Charl Schwartzel birdies 15 to move back to -5, and Matt Kuchar pars the last. He’s back in 31 for a 67, and is the clubhouse leader at -5! So while Sergio may be floundering, this isn’t over yet! -8: Rose (12) -6: Garcia (12) -5: Kuchar (F), Pieters (16), Schwartzel (15) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.45pm EDT 17:45 Pars for Sergio and Rose at 12. Rose very nearly drained his gentle left-to-right drifter, but it died to the right just before the cup. Rose remains two clear of Pieters and his playing partner. And he once again turns the screw on Sergio by blasting a monster drive down 13. Sergio has to nail his ... and he pulls it. That’s not in Rae’s Creek, is it? He wanders after his ball with furrowed brow. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.40pm EDT 17:40 Pieters sends his tee shot at 16 into the bunker between the pin and the water. A birdie at 13 moves Rickie Fowler back to -4. Kuchar crashes his drive straight down 18, and though he toys with Lyle’s Bunker, he’s in prime position. Scott hits the bank in front of the green at 15, and watches in horror as his ball topples back into the water. And in the final group, both Rose and Sergio find the heart of the green at 12, but they’ll have 30-footers across the thin green for their birdies. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.35pm EDT 17:35 Rose misses his six footer for birdie. Such a shame after a brilliant approach. But par at 11 on Sunday will do. And he’ll be two clear, because Sergio can’t get up and down from the edge of the green, missing a ten-footer for par, and that’s a bogey. Meanwhile birdie for Pieters at 15 after a good look at eagle; four birdies in a row and he’s right in this now! Kuchar pars 17 meanwhile, and he’ll soon be posting a score to beat. -8: Rose (11) -6: Pieters (15), Garcia (11) -5: Kuchar (17) Updated at 5.42pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.31pm EDT 17:31 Spieth couldn’t make his bogey putt on 12 and that’s a double, another Sunday shocker on 12. Augusta National has really done a number on his noggin. He drops to +1. Fowler bogeys after finding the sand; he’s back to -3. Schwartzel meanwhile is faced with a treacherous pitch from the left of 14. He lands on the green, but the ball scoots 80 feet past. A long trundle for par back up the hole goes six feet past; he pops it in, but that’s a momentum-busting bogey and he’s back to -4. Adam Scott is at -4 too, moving the other way after birdies at 13 and 14. Birdie for Paul Casey at 15, following bogey at 14. He’s -3. Meanwhile Fred Couples signs for a 72. He’s +1 for his week’s work. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.25pm EDT 17:25 Now Pieters joins the group at -5 with his third birdie on the bounce, this time at 14! Back down the hole, once Pieters clears the green, Schwartzel sends his second miles left. Meanwhile Sergio is indeed stuck flush behind a large tree to the left of 11. He really should take his medicine and chip back out onto the fairway, but opts to fire through a very small gap to the left of the tree and a bush. Fortune favours the brave, as he punches a low iron to the front of the green. He’ll have chance to scramble his par, or at least limit the damage! But Justin Rose shows his match-play moxie by sticking his second to six feet. The pressure turned up on Sergio, right here! Updated at 5.31pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.21pm EDT 17:21 Hole-in-one for Matt Kuchar at 16! He bounces his ball to the right of the flag, ten feet past, and lets the topography take the ball back towards the hole. And it’s always going in! If Augusta had a roof, it’d be spinning somewhere over North Carolina now! An ace at the Masters, but more importantly, an eagle that moves him to -5! Another birdie or two, and he’ll be posting a score that may give the leaders, whoever they may be, pause! -8: Rose (10) -7: Garcia (10) -5: Kuchar (16), Schwartzel (13) Matt Kuchar reacts after his hole in one on the 16th. Photograph: Matt Slocum/AP Updated at 5.36pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.17pm EDT 17:17 Up on 13, Schwartzel has a look at eagle from 25 feet, but the ball stays high on the left. He leaves himself a missable four footer, but in it goes, and at -5 he’s only three off the lead! This is turning into a fascinating, and unpredictable, afternoon! Although make of this what you will: Sergio has whistled his drive at 11 into the trees down the left, and may be snookered by another tree! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.15pm EDT 17:15 Jordan Spieth finds water at 12 for the second Masters Sunday in a row! He lands his ball on the Fred Couples Bank. It threatens to stick, but dribbles back into the drink. He goes to the drop zone, and chips to six feet. But he’ll be dropping at least one stroke here. He just hasn’t got going at all today. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.14pm EDT 17:14 Two putts, and that’s Sergio’s first bogey since 9 yesterday. That is something of an escape, given the preposterous place he’d put himself. Rose meanwhile gets up and down from the front, chipping to a couple of feet, and he’s now leading the Masters on his own! Fowler meanwhile can’t get up and down from the back of 11 and drops to -4. -8: Rose (10) -7: Garcia (10) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.12pm EDT 17:12 It’s difficult to explain how bad Sergio’s shot was there. Fired miles to the right, he’s got a small tree directly in front of him, a huge bunker further on, and then one of Augusta’s trademark greens of nonsense. He lashes a chip high and back down onto the green, his ball rolling across it from right to left and into the fringe at the side. That’s actually not too bad from where he was. But he really needs to get up and down. “Does Dr Golf do home visits?” wonders Simon McMahon. Dr Golf suddenly feels very ill. Garcia hits from the pine on the 10th. Photograph: David J.

Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion. Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. It's not only a name change, though. There are a few important new features, including a search shortcut and true multi-language support. The update is still rolling out, and Google has not yet posted an official changelog. Here's what we've spotted so far. G button (enabled in settings) offers quick access to search from the keyboard Pop-out toolbar (when G button not enabled) provides access to themes, settings, one-handed mode, and search Optional dedicated number row Up to three active languages with preference for one (previously had to switch) Gesture typing is now called Glide typing. Search for emoji Rearranged emoji panel with group selection at bottom Emoji have bright halo effect around them GIF button is always shown, but disabled in apps without support. We'll update if we spot anything else, but this should be most of it. Keep in mind, the G button is optional because you can still access integrated search from the toolbar pop-out. It's just one extra step. It's up to you if you prefer to just have the button. That's cool and all, but the dedicated number row will make a lot more people happy. You have to turn that on in settings as well. Those on the team who speak multiple languages seem quite excited about the multiple language support too. You can actually type in up to three of them without manually switching keyboard modes. This is similar to the way SwiftKey does it. The update is just starting to roll out, but we've got the new version on APK Mirror (Android 4.2 and higher). Note, it's in a different area of APK Mirror than the old Google Keyboard, but it is just an update. Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion.

Marko Šaric Hand for dipping bread in egg yolk. Dominic81 "multiple active languages" FINALLY!!! WORPspeed THIS!!! SO much this! I was excited for gboard, but lack of this was holding me back, but reading that it is now included, I can say ADIOS SWIFTKEY! Or maybe it doesn't work as good :P Swiftkey isn't bad, just excited about gboard :D motoridersd Same! I love SwiftKey, but it can do some annoying things from time to time. I'm definitely going to be check out this new Gboard. WORPspeed And I already switched back to swiftkey. The delete swipe gesture on gboard is just horrible, it should just delete 1 word per swipe, not every either 1 letter or the whole sentence.....needs an undo button. The layout...well I'm just used to Swiftkey's layout and the way swiftkey is smart enough to isnert a space after a comma....small things that make gboard a horrible experience for me. I do keep it around incase I want to sent a gif/meme image, it's easier switching keyboards then apps :D motoridersd Yeah, the placement of the question and exclamation marks on Gboard is awful. Too many taps to get to them (they're probably hiding behind another key, but I didn't go hunting for them). Not getting a space after a comma, or getting a space after a word when putting in a question mark was annoying. The delete gesture is definitely not good on Gboard. Jordan Long press m or n is too many taps for question marks and exclamation points? Or press and slide on the period key? They're all very easy to get to. Also the slide-to-delete action is great. I don't know of any keyboard that does it in a significantly better way. motoridersd Turns out I had the symbol setting turned off, so I didn't see any of the characters on the letters or the period. The slide to delete on Swiftkey works very well because it works on the whole keyboard, not just on the backspace key. I've been spoiled by just swiping anywhere to delete a typo. You have to disable flow typing for this to work, but I don't miss that feature. Zorkos You don´t need an undo button. After you delete something the deleted text will appear as a suggestion Urs Müller It also doesn't seem to predict the next word. Instead it shows options for the currently swyped word... Also back to Swiftkey for now. Rapper_skull My dream came true. Rod Our* Rod What? Like in Swiftkey? rauldzmartin Exactly. Mario Porfírio Souza I hope that feature works well, because in swiftkey dont work well HARAMBE It doesn't even correct italian words with some french shit! GLORIOUS Vincent Bye bye SwiftKey samiazza Can somebody explain how does this work? Georgiy Alexandrov I guess it will predict words for both languages depend on what you type in, without need of switching languages manually. Apps By Usman basically what swype provided years ago :) (it's good to see google adapt it) bat0nas Exactly. Been using multiple language in Swype for years. HaltestelleLuitpolthafen I text in both German and English, but 75% of the time in English. I don't have to go into settings and manually switch it from English to Germany anymore, I can have it do it on the fly and set it to prefer English since that is what I predominantly speak. Felix /Offtopic When I interpret your username right you're from Mannheim? Why do you speak English predominantly? ;) mitchilin You don't have to go into settings. Just press the world icon on the keyboard and it changes language instantly. I've been doing this for years with German. snoop doge what do you exactly mean by it? Ashish Bogawat It is a good start, but Swiftkey has quite a headstart with support for many more languages. It (Swiftkey) even does English & Hindi, even though they use different scripts. I type in English and it suggests matching Hindi words along with the English suggestions. Ash Google has that as well, but that keyboard is Google Indic keyboard prediscover no asian language support though :( Ash Hindi, Tamil etc are Asian language. Fir Chinese there is seperate keyboard prediscover I thought Hindi had a separate keyboard too jenderalcilik I too excited for this. I installed right away after reading that sentences. I mean I always loved Swiftkey, but sometimes I hate it when it loads so slow when I switch from app to app. I hope this worked well. Eddy Nelson Lopez This is so épico ahora puedo change languages sin tener que touch the world icono 😂😂 Total Insecurity Hahaha^^ Robert Trance LOL, you so won this thread.... Avishek Jajajajaja Lord Argyris One upvote, duly earned. El_Big_CHRIS My main reason for sticking to SwiftKey, maybe I'll finally ditch it iiku it is also available for chrome spellchecking. Vratislav Jindra "multiple active languages" I HATE IT SO MUCH!!! I've never used it on other keyboards which had this feature. When I'm tapping, the keyboard usually guesses the language correctly. But when I start the text with swiping, it's more like 50:50 - sometimes it guesses the correct word, but very often it also offers me a word from a different language. I'd rather keep pressing the "switch language" button on my keyboard to switch languages manually instead of relying on a technology which fails half the time. bidou I don't like it either. It always writes the wrong word from the wrong language. You can disable it in the keyboard options and go back to the normal "press the switch language icon" type. Vratislav Jindra You're right, I must have missed that setting. Thank you very much! Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez It's happening!! Aleluya! I've been waiting eagerly for this feature since Google Keyboard supports Gif images. Sorry Swiftkey but now is time to move on. HopTzop Too bad it doesn't work well, at least here it's a pain in the arse. Also sometimes doesn't get the whole sliding and gives just a letter, sometimes it gives a totally different word that has nothing to do with what you slide, but happens to start with that letter. They just made me buy Swype which feels like it's reading my mind and runs buttery smooth. Bewear ARM64 only :c aSquard http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-release/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-armeabi-v7a-android-apk-download/ Bewear Thanks. Brian ARM64 though :( Phoenix FUUUUDGE Andy Roid Whaaaa Adrianus AJ Nadeak There's an ARM version available. Michael Carr Can't say I'm a fan of the name change, but the new features sound cool. Downloading! Phoenix OMG is this really happening ? is this really happening ? FINALLY Carson Saldanha Ohh yeah... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif Phoenix I spoke too soon, it's still not happening for ARM owners lol just ARM64 Carson Saldanha Hopefully APKMirror will have the arm version soon. Artem Russakovskii Up now. Volodesi A number row? Finally. I can stop using SwiftKey. k0n And symbols hinting! I can have it set up almost exactly like SwiftKey now, but with added benefits and no extra app required :) FrozenHotChocolate Trying this right away!. But will still need a lot of improvements on the predictions front to pull me away from Swiftkey though. Michael Schaap Neat. Looks like it finally has most of the features I'm using Swiftkey for. (Number 1: multiple languages simultaneously – I tend to type in meerdere talen tegelijk; number 2: number row.) I guess I'll have to try it out and see if it beats Swiftkey yet. (Its prediction is still scarily accurate, though.) Rod It's been said here that it now supports multiple languages simultaneously. Michael Schaap Indeed. That's what I'm saying. Rod It's like a dream came true, until I saw the arm64 requisite.. Comediante "Optional dedicated number row" - It was about time! Only thing I miss is the hability to theme choosing colors (primary/accent) from a material color pallete and not just choose from a limited theme gallery. Jaime Andres Salame Borja Does it have Gif search? AdamH Yup, only works in Hangouts tho.. Artem Russakovskii Not only. In Messenger too. Badouken And Allo :P Abhilash Bingi Yup, but the app has to support it. Only Messenger and Hangouts do as of now. Rod No love for 32 bit. :( Baalinooo Not available for Nexus 6 then? :( Ten Bears not yet anyway... Rod Nope. CD RW ARM apk now available ntomka You don't have to wait for long. I got it through Google play update to my Honor 6 Plus, which is a 32bit phone. 😃 Rapper_skull Then upload the APK to APKMirror. EDIT: Never mind, it has already been uploaded. Rod Excellent news. Thanks! Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9835dd11c8683e36c4fcf70d1cd5c1ccbb48c6158a3019cd0c72fdcb6fce9949.gif Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif mx3 But no emoji prediction :( Caleb Lee ☹️ someone755 This guy does not use Gboard. cowboysfanzz Use Textra with Gboard it's heaven mx3 This has nothing to do with emoji prediction. cowboysfanzz Yes. Textra has emoji prediction XerBlade But it's a single SMS app, not something that magically adds stuff to the keyboard, so it doesn't help you in literally every other app on your device. wade_county I must be blind, where in the settings is emoji prediction in Textra? Corey Kinard If only Textra would use, or allow as an option, stock Android's quick reply in the notifications (where it sticks) and also added the stock inline reply option in heads up messages. It feels so cluncky to have their huge "quick reply" screen pop up now. I guess they could slim the app a bit by dropping the GIFs too since it's in Gboard. Marcus Clendenin You can search in the emoji keyboard. It's not as nice as the emoji prediction in Swiftkey but it does help when trying to find an emoji Cakefish Emoji search doesn't work for me. Just says "data for emoji search is not available". Weird. Checked permissions. Checked internet connectivity. Marcus Clendenin I saw a reddit comment that said the initial download needs to happen on WiFi? So maybe try doing that. I haven't been on WiFi today so I can't confirm whether that works Cakefish You sir, are a gentlemen and a scholar! Thanks! Jacques Ligier Can anyone confirm whether it works? Robert Trance I can predict for you... Marko Šaric Poll: What was your first search ever with gboard for android? AfrodanJ Pictures of Santa PHLAK What about gif support? Kyle Gospodnetich It's been there for months. Aaron I see it but it's crossed out here. Guess it only works on apps that support it. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, the button is now permanent, just disabled in app that don't support it, which is different than the previously confusing contextual GIF button. JSo You can now do a search with the keyboard which will pull up gifs in the results like it does by hitting the "gif" button. I tried it in Inbox but it inserts the link and not the gif itself. Anthony Castanza Its actually happening!! But what are we going to complain about now?! Oh wait, Allo. Nevermind. Michael Kennedy Fuckin' Allo... :( rauldzmartin Is it not killed by Google yet? Cesar Something something no sms fallback... Rapper_skull Multi-language is not exactly what I wanted. I now see IT - EN - ES, meaning that I will receive suggestions for Italian, English and Spanish. But what I really wanted was scrolling the spacebar to switch language, so that I can type Greek letters while writing. Unfortunately writing math will still be slow. Martin Can't you just tap the "change language" key? One tap, and there you have your Greek keyboard. Rapper_skull Nope, I also have other keyboards, so a lot of taps are needed. Martin I'm not talking about the "Change keyboard" button. I'm talking about the "change language" key next to the space key. You can enable it in the settings ("Show language switch key"), and it lets you cycle through your language with single taps. Rapper_skull Like the default Android button, it still cycles between keyboards. Martin That's strange. I have four different keyboards installed, and the language switch button only cycles through the different languages in Gboard for me. YouNex Long press number row for (some) Greek letters ! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad08d55f06a775a882ce447cac20fc395dae92cb2d45714f508054225311896c.jpg Rapper_skull Doesn't work for me :( YouNex Android version/GBoard version ? Rapper_skull Android 6.0.1, GBoard 6.2.18.151907649 YouNex I updated to GBoard 6.2.22 and it's gone. I think you'll need to downgrade to GBoard 6.1.x Android 7.1.1 btw YouNex As you may have noticed, the screenshot above doesn't have rounded letter keys, which means version below 6.2 YouNex My GBoard version was 6.1.71 to be exact Tomáš Petrík Can you disable all of the top rows? No suggestions, no numbers, no G button, no themes shortcut... Just make it gone. I can do that in current version. If that option is gone, I will hesitate to update. I value screen estate. mattcoz Yes Tomáš Petrík Thanks! Igor Stanić How? mattcoz Oh, I see now that it still shows a bar with everything turned off in some apps. I tried it from the search bar and it wasn't there. Sorry about that. Tomáš Petrík Sadly, the answer is no. mattcoz Right, as I mentioned in my followup reply. Jaime Andres Salame Borja I wanted to search GIFs in Whatsapp? then i believe Whatsapp has to add the search engine... :( AbbyZFresh No gif support. Back to Swiftkey. Naxx ENVY It does support gifs... press the emoji button and its at the bottom,. the app has to support them too though senor_heisenberg Awesome. I'm so glad this was an update and not a separate app. Maxr1998 "Introducing Google Type, a smart keyboard with Google Assistant, tied to your phone number, and without SMS support." Vincent Don't give them ideas.. Clawz114 "The emoji panel was causing confusion with our users, so we have seperated this from the Gboard and Google Type to it's own dedicated emoji app, Gemoji." T4rd Hope they fix the the space bar cursor moving gesture, as it rarely works for my on my 6P. Sometimes if I try it for 20-30 secs it'll eventually remember I had that feature checked and start moving the cursor, so it's basically useless. Cory S Yeah, its a little stiff. I like the way it works on Chroma. Dehaha1 I agree, it's largely useless on my Nexus 5. It usually works on my second or third attempt, however at that point it would have been faster to just tap where I needed to go. On my iPad Mini 2 using GBoard it works much better, though sadly not as flexible as what is built into the default Apple keyboard. (Though I can't give up using GBoard, the gesture typing is too useful) mattcoz Are you holding and sliding or just doing a quick swipe? T4rd Tried it both ways several times. But I see now that if I do a quick swipe, it seems to work better, but still kinda inconsistent and awkward to use. Like your finger has to already be swiping before you touch the space bar, which doesn't feel right. So I think they need to tweak this gesture to allow you to do it while holding in on the space bar for a split second before swiping at least, esp since that doesn't have any other function associated with it (at least in my config). mattcoz No, you should NOT be doing a quick swipe. You hold it down and slide your finger, don't lift it until the cursor is where you want it. If that's not working, then there's something wrong. Martin I don't know if I'm just lucky, but I got it to work on the new Gboard on every single try so far. Previously it would always bring up the "Change Keyboard" menu instead, no matter how fast or slow I tried swiping. Simon I agree this function works much better with this new update. Berkay Did they add the two new keyboard themes that were on the pixel? Badouken Yes it has the blue color schemes for standard light and dark themes. Berkay I went ahead and got the APK because I was impatient, thank you anyway :) How do I use the GIF functionality? It doesn't seem to work anywhere. JSo Only works in apps that support it. Google Messenger, Hangouts and Allo. App developers apparently have to enable it themselves Badouken Mine didn't work at first but then randomly appeared after awhile. It appears when I clicked the smile icon at the bottom, it would then show a gif button next to it. Berkay Whenever I use the emoji search, it's so laggy... But google keyboard has been laggy for me since they introduced the update where they added all those new features like one handed mode. Tiuri Elvander I saw saw a video showing that the iOS version could send little screenshots of search results. I can't find a way to do that in this version of am I missing something?? Lazyboy0172 unfortunately doesn't look like we're missing anything. whenever I search for something it shows a "share" button but just inserts the text from the result as well as http link for the search. It's not the worst, but I'd much prefer to insert it as an image, especially in apps that support the official api for image insertion from keyboard. I mean it's already there with gif search, so why not make those shared search results as pretty in my text message as they are on the keyboard? Still very happy to be able to search from keyboard though, and be able to search emoji. Goodbye, Dango. Goodbye, Swiftkey. Please keep improving, GBoard. Paul_Werner I wasn't using Swiftkey but I was just like you regarding Dango. Glad to have it a part of the built in keyboard now saf1927 The multi language support works really well with two languages. Haven't added a third yet, but now Swift Key is really obsolete for me. Christopher Robert Does it allow for keyboard size scaling? How about better prediction? Themes? yep still not a good replacement for Swiftkeye. Tuck Choate Yes, yes, and yes. They're in the settings. Good thing Swiftkeye has good autocorrect. It'd be embarrassing to make a typo that contradicts your point online. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Multiple active languages". That look a long ass time to happen. br_hermon I want to like Gboard but it's lack of secondary key functions keeps me using SwiftKey. Abhilash Bingi What do you mean by "secondary key functions"? If you mean typing symbols by long pressing alphabets, you can do it in Google Keyboard. br_hermon Thanks the heads up! I never knew that. It's disabled by default. I had to go into settings to enable it. epsiblivion not a fan of all this rebranding to G products. must be new internal management on the apps. Ben G products... like what? Except this one? Perry Mason Gmail /s Todd I really hate that they did it to their email app. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. bikrame Hey guys, how do i add that numerical line above on keyboard.

Using an LG G4. Georgiy Alexandrov Settings > preferences > number row Alex Guitar This is mucho bueno for my Spanglish! Frisi *muy :P Frisi Bye Swiftkey. It's me or Swiftkey caused more "typos" than any other keyboard? Of course, Swiftkey would correct them, but I type better using Google's Keyboard. Now with multi-lingo support I'm more than happy. motoridersd I've been using SwiftKey for a long, long time since I have always needed two languages. I have not been using Flow since I live by the swipe to delete gesture. I love the SwiftKey prediction of emoji, I use it ALL the time, and I am very used to the layout of the keyboard. Trying Gboard for the first time, it feels odd, but it's easy to type in. It doesn't seem to always introduce the period after hitting space bar twice. Swiping the backspace key to delete a word is cumbersome because the surface is very small, so I'm missing that already. There is no emoji prediction, but the search is nice. Unfortunately it doesn't know the latest emoji like bacon, avocado or facepalm, but once they are in the recent window, this can be less of an issue. The prediction does not work in the search box, which is a shame, because searching Google without it is a PITA. Hurricane Andrew The prediction also does not work in Chrome or the Facebook search field. Big oversight. motoridersd Yeah, I use that a lot with SwiftKey. A new Gboard update just came through, wonder if they're tweaking these things. Christian yup and for this thing i still use swiftkey, is really helpfull the prediction in chrome ;) Freek Smulders This is pretty big! #NotMyPresident Why would you want an advertising company logging all your keystrokes? PVL_93_RU I'd rather trust them than my own government to do the same #NotMyPresident LOL. Okay..... /rolleyes 7-down It's in the settings. You can disable sharing of what you type. #NotMyPresident And if you believe that Google respects that, I've got a bridge to sell you. 7-down Hopefully it's the Golden Gate Bridge. I really like the way it looks. http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ec/ec23811e3ebf097d66addd31391d2b84d094eb85cc37a9b74dec3475a722ca0c.jpg XerBlade Gboard settings > Advanced > Disable "Share snippets" (if it really bothers you that much) P.S. It never actually logs all your keystrokes, even with that enabled. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I see how that could be a concern. They should've filtered the keyboard the way it is in iOS, since that would probably give a lot of people more peace of mind. For example, on iOS, you can't enter your password using Gboard for this exact reason. Whenever you have to enter a password or pin number, it automatically reverts back to the default keyboard (which doesn't store information) to prevent anything getting leaked. But, all in all, this version is pretty cool too. XerBlade ...Seriously, this isn't sending your passwords back to Google. Apple did things that way in iOS to prevent possible malicious third party keyboard replacements from taking advantage of that (which IS a concern in Android: seriously, you probably shouldn't go around installing random keyboards from people you've never heard of). This keyboard, being not-a-malicious-app and all, simply never includes anything marked as a password field in the "snippets" it sometimes [optionally] collects as statistical data for use in improving the app. Knowledgeborn Allah At least that's what they tell you... I'm not trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but we don't really know what's happening behind the scenes. Google is an advertising company, and their job is to know as much about you as possible. Statistical data is one thing, but personal information is something different. Another thing that separates the Android version from the iOS version is that the Android version is tied to your Google account, while the one on iOS functions independently. That's how, on Android, they can share "learned words" across your Android devices. They can filter these through your devices because, since they're tied into your Google account, what you type (or at least some of it) goes through Google's servers. It's not anonymous data to just improve the app. It's data specifically about you, tied to your personal account. PVL_93_RU So when the G button is active - how do you switch languages? Do you just tap the same key? Is there a gesture like swipe the spacebar (swiftkey)? Frisi You don't have to now since it will automatically "change" as you type. PVL_93_RU I don't like that XerBlade The G button is unrelated. By default, it has multiple languages active simultaneously (so you just type and it intelligently figures out which language you're using as it goes). Or you can manually switch languages by long pressing spacebar (was already a thing in Google Keyboard). OR you can enable the dedicated language switch button in the settings (was also already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar (note the optional G button is on the left side of the suggestions pane, so again, completely unrelated). PVL_93_RU >OR you can enable the language switch button in the settings (was already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar Phew, thank god Kwetsima Maluleke Number row? Finally! Nuno G. Gboard?! What were these guys drinking?!? raazman The good stuff. tim242 Nothing good about this POS. raazman You're entitled to your own opinion. To me, the best keyboard out there just got better. tim242 Yeah, because a blank bar taking up screen real estate is so much better. I'm glad you like it. raazman What blank bar? tim242 The settings bar, above the keyboard. raazman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2569deb1397c93e3c918c8e97290dbd8c70fafb66fa9d5277b20236aa34124a6.png Huh? What exactly are you talking about? tim242 That bar where you have suggestions. I don't use suggestions. If you disable suggestions, the bar remains as a blank bar. They do this on about every other version. raazman Ah ok, makes sense. I use the suggestions so I never had the need to remove it. Aaron Sounds like a personal problem. tim242 You sound like a blocked problem : ) Aaron Doesn't matter. You can't stop anyone from replying. Wis Ciao Swiftkey, this is soooo good - everything I wanted. Thx, Google... David Prieto What's with the emoji search? Why doesn't it return any results? JSo Emoji search is working for me. ADofCLE The number row is probably the only new feature I am going to use lol mattcoz Dedicated number row? Dedicated number row?! DEDICATED NUMBER ROW!!! Andy Roid Yes, that's what it says in the article mattcoz It sure does! Adrianus AJ Nadeak #DEDICATEDNUMBERROW yka1988 OMG finally! I just switched back to SwiftKey after months and months of using the super snappy Google Keyboard. Those were exactly the things I was missing, and especially the language features made me switch back recently. well, byebye Swiftkey, welcome back Gboard :) El Jefe this is great so now I can do GIF kb in Hangouts but only lif not via SMS. In the Google Messenger app, I can do GIF kb with SMS... I'm running latest everything 7.1.1 ahhh Jordan L I'm not seeing the G button on my Pixel XL. anyone else? I enabled it in settings. rebooting now. I also don't see any text predictions. the whole top bar is missing. EDIT: reboot fixed. XerBlade Make sure you're in an app that supports text predictions. It won't show up if you are typing in the Google search bar, for example. Bewear Emoji search not working for me. It might be because my device is set in Spanish. Scros97 A mi sí que me funciona en castellano la búsqueda de emoji! Bewear Not for me :/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a56c197ba6b723f6ccc0ba473c4dc94277e9cac70a07f5146133052155fdc1f8.jpg Kieron Quinn I have the same issue, apparently you have to be on WiFi at least once for it to download. Shame I won't be until tomorrow. keithzg See this is when it pays to have two devices, so you set one to be a wifi hotspot, then trade off ;) Kieron Quinn My Nexus 5X IS a hotspot, because my flat wifi is broken Ashwin I've installed the app on wifi, have been on wifi the entire day and also tried the same with the new update and still the same error persists for me. What do I do? Cakefish Same but my language is English :( alessiolarva No way to search images directly from the keyboard? tim242 Great. From 41, to 72 MB running service, and laggy again uggggh Aaron Really? Not seeing any lag here. Maybe it's your phone? Would be the first time a Galaxy experienced lag... tim242 Yeah, because a Galaxy chooses which versions of Google Keyboard to lag on. *Eye roll JSo No lag here either. It's not the update. Rod Actually it's showing up as 100mb ish for me. Alex Feels like they finally fixed the Google keyboard lag. That is my only gripe with my Pixel XL ahtough that problem was also on the 6p). Cakefish "Data for emoji search is not available." What does that mean? Samson Don't know. It works for me. Cakefish What phone do you have and which Android version? I have Nougat 7.0. Samson Much appreciated update. I like it a lot! Rod This is the official Google keyboard. Samson It is now. And the problem still exists. So I had to go back to the older version of the official Google keyboard. Very disappointing. Dustin Mingo Swipe from backspace is gone :( Georgiy Alexandrov It still there, or did you mean something else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/09a329c7a63ed9bb2bcdeec4f5376ebdb3d98d40b75e3f7e2788bf488a681485.png Dustin Mingo Setting's gone for me. I'll clear data and report back Georgiy Alexandrov That's good to hear JSo No it's not Rod It isn't. Steve Will they ever enable its auto-corrections/auto-suggestions when searching? Rocket Does anyone know what happened to picture background? JSo You mean in themes? It's still there Rocket On the old Google Keyboard you could select a picture as the theme, but it looks like its gone now. JSo It's still there for me. I don't know why it's not working for you Rocket Did you do it as an update or as a new installation?? JSo I installed the apk right over my existing app Rocket Im gonna reinstall Google Keyboard (and brave the clunky LG Keyboard) and then update to GBoard Rocket Got it working by selecting a theme and then updating. Now it's an option. Georgiy Alexandrov Working for me on 7.1 and 6.0 but not on 4.4. Well, that's weird Rocket I'm on 5.1 so maybe that has something to do with it? Corey Kinard You sure? I press the arrow on the top left of the Keyboard, press the pallet, and the first theme option for me in Gboard is the "My images" one Edit: way too late! Igor Stanić how to disable popup toolbar when g is not enabled???...it just takes up space...everything is fantastic except this freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still better Igor Stanić How to disable suggestion row ...i dont use it so it is blank...terrible Georgiy Alexandrov You can't, as far as i know tim242 Yep, they always fuck something up. I had to revert back. Igor Stanić Me too Archenuh How to you revert back this damn cancer of an app? Dave Okay, wow. This app somehow fucked up my Pixel XL. I've installed it and it always freezed and didn't let me close the keyboard anymore. So I force restarted where it got stuck. I've hold down the power button again to force restart and when it booted up I was set back to Android 7.1 (had 7.1.1) and I can't access recent apps, can get into the quick settings, have different system settings (for example it vibrates when pressing home although I had it disabled) and it doesn't get data connection. What is this? JSo I really don't think a little keyboard app could cause all that. The most that could probably happen is that the keyboard may keep force closing if you installed the wrong version but I don't think it would do all the things you said happened. Dave I don't know either. But that's how it went. Everything was working fine and after I've installed the keyboard and it kept freezing and therefore covering up half my display although I was on the homescreen I force restarted where it got stuck. One again force starting brought me to that situation I am in now. Zach Mauch LOVE LOVE LOVE the dedicated number row. I would also like the option to add a "tab" button to the keyboard. suavemezie No emoji predictions? JSo What are these emoji predictions everyone is bringing up? Georgiy Alexandrov A SwiftKey (or other keyboard) feature, something like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/045c7a98611e38f08413474280cb41eb8fd78121f38eae7386543f5cc4490eb2.png JSo Was this something that was shown by Google or that the GBoard on iOS has? Just seems everyone is bringing this up all of a sudden. Georgiy Alexandrov Idk, but I dont remember Gboard having this on iOS. I guess it just a popular feature that many custom keyboards have. DubeBoom While Gboard feels much faster and more fluid, there are some things I just like about Swiftkey like the easy access to ? and !. But I'll try using Gboard for a few days to see if I get used to it. JSo Turn on "Long Press For Symbols" for easy access to those. Ashish Bogawat I have that option, but with Swiftkey you don't even need to long-press. Just swipe left on the '.' key. Seems small, but is super efficient once you get used to it. mattcoz Another quick method is to swipe from the symbol key, see if that works for you. Adrianus AJ Nadeak It's not as easy on a wide phone like the Nexus 6. mattcoz True Rod Decrease the long press delay, set it to 120ms. It'll make your life easier. Arshdeep Singh Saini It doesn't install 😢 Nathan J Aww. Google Keyboard's growing up. It was always my favorite keyboard on Android, even though it lacked some features of other keyboards. It was accurate which is what I liked. "Gboard" is a downgrade. On iOS, the Gboard autocorrect is just off the wall. Microsoft's Flow Keyboard (did y'all get that yet?) is better for trace typing, but it will not learn new words. No curse words, no proper names... gotta tap that out. So I deal with Gboard since it will learn... but not from its mistakes. It might be a limitation of iOS, but Gboard on iOS is vastly inferior to Google Keyboard on Android. Coming from someone who has used both extensively. Craig Nelson I have both myself and you're right the auto correct on Gboard IOS is not as good as IOS native keyboard but I will say that the Gboard on IOS seems slightly better than the one on android when it comes to the fluidity of finding a search result and using it. Max Not a second-copy-of-the-same-app? S**t what's happened Google? mrjayviper finally catch up to iOS. Thanks google. I'll be enjoying this on my note4 as I've been doing on the Air2 and 6s+ itsatrap Its good but still no better than Swiftkey. Not even close. jl2222 ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You can perform google search in Swiftkey? Find a gif without leaving the keyboard? itsatrap Those things are extras, keyboards are for typing. Swiftkey is still far better at it. On top of that, there is this annoying bug: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 Rod I agree. Swiftkey still has the lead. Azzy Fuck, only 3 languages at a time! Luckily SwiftKey can accommodate 5, just the number I need! Rod You speak 5 languages? Not bad! steb0ne Finally NERV I am still waiting for it to include those Asian languages so I don't need to download a worse separated one. xunknownx finally! been waiting for the google keyboard to have a dedicated number row. Albin Does it record keystrokes? Rod Of course. Machine learning is a thing. Umer Farooq It now also supports Urdu swiping and suggestions. Vincent Goh Asian languages? I need English, German, and Chinese. I don't need multi languages to include Chinese, but I don't want to switch keyboard app whenever I need to type Chinese. pfmiller Might be more realistic for them to add better English and other Latin alphabet language support to the Pinyin keyboard. I can understand them not wanting to clutter up their main keyboard with various input methods. Ramiro Fernandez I noticed something, don't know if it's new to this version but pretty sure it is. The keyboard will sometimes now correct *back* one word if the next word you type changes what it would predict. So I typed "I'm feeling" but when I typed "I'm" it detected it as "on". Then after typing "feeling" it changed the "on" to "I'm". Gave me options for the two word suggestion too (see screenshot). Doesn't always happen, I guess it depends on how close I was with my gliding and how confident it was with the original prediction. I've never seen this before, but it's really clever. I wish it would take context into account better when suggesting words in general. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f788aeb53d108efe429fbde31f0cead3ef3ecba862432200ee25bd8e1eecf969.png Rod Yeah, I noticed it yersterday whilst replying to a Reddit comment. itsatrap Do you guys have this problem: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/sxhRXvLfILk WesleySmalls Have they learned nothing from the IE6 toolbars? benjammin03 I am waiting for the google keyboard to have the swipe left to delete the last word. After using it on Swiftkey, it's impossible to use a keyboard without it. Portgas D. Ace Gboard does have this option. benjammin03 I think I tried this before, but I couldn't get used to having to start at the delete key. I'm used to being able to swipe left from anywhere. I forgot about it though, so I'm going to give it another shot since this is the only reason I still use Swiftkey. Thanks! Portgas D. Ace I used Swiftkey in the past but never gestures. So I had no idea it works differently there. Rod In Gboard, you'll need to swipe from the backspace key. But, it's more effective, as you can delete a 10,000 word text all at once. Portgas D. Ace https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/751b4dcb558130893fe4db757a19aa363e250b3b3f2f347889f55783a469ef98.png Rod Swipe horizontally from the backspace key, and you can even delete the whole text at once. Faheem Ahmed not available in 4.2+ Promethean Add Swypes select all/copy/cut/paste gestures and I'm sold, I use them a lot more than I thought and missed them from other keyboards. Jack Sparrow I find it very buggy. It shows only one result. No horizontal scrolling like on iOS. And the funny thing is, if you search for "gboard", it returns the result for slash keyboard! Is it just me or is everyone facing the issue? Rod What do you mean, horizontal scrolling? Savage Alien "Emoji have bright halo effect around them" Yeah, whose bright idea was this? It doesn't look very pretty. QeeYou i know right 😂, looks very bad in bright themes'. neonix One more new feature I noticed: you can now edit the current theme. I believe previously, you couldn't make changes once the image was set. Dobriy Her Still not available in Turkish play store keithzg Oddly enough, the Play Store is still reporting this to me as Google Keyboard, but showing the version to be 6.mumble, while if I go into Settings -> Languages & Input -> Virtual Keyboards I see Gboard. Portgas D. Ace I get it listed as Gboard the Google keyboard in the updates list and as Google keyboard in the play store listing. dylan-m So, anyone else finding the emoji keyboard uniquely irritating now? They're wasting a ridiculous amount of vertical space, they have *two rows* of tabs, and the bottom row of tabs appears where the space bar is (while the emoji key is right beside the comma key). I frequently end up looking at the plain text smileys keyboard because I happen to miss the comma key while I'm typing. (They probably shifted the keys over by a few pixels again). That would have been fine with the old keyboard because the key to go back was in the exact same place. Now you have to pause and look for it because *the entire layout suddenly changes*. Also, they only have three tiny squashed little rows for the actual emoji, which is as many rows as they have for chrome. It's completely terrible. It would not be hard to flip that first row of tabs to the top, squeeze the search button beside them (because it doesn't need to be a text box and they can probably kill a category or two), and maintain a consistent layout for the bottom row of keys. Anyway, this is the second time in six months they have made significant changes to the keyboard layout, unexpectedly screwing with peoples' muscle memory. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by Google any more, but, it's pretty bad form. Ashwin "Data for emoji search is not available" error when tryed to search emoji...Anyone else with the same error?? Even updated to 6.0.68 (first update after Gboard 6.0.65)...Still no luck...Guys, someone please help!! please Does anyone know how the f I can disable the stupid toolbar? I HATE it, it just takes up space and I'll never use it. Any drastic measure to get rid of it works for me. Archenuh I really need this as well. What the fuck is wrong with them adding that fucking stupid toolbar above the keyboard and not letting us DISABLE it?! please how to disable toolbar LOL How does active languages work? I don't get it Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms... LOL So it only works with Latin alphabet? Rod No, those were examples. The app description on Play Store says it covers over 120 languages. LOL But I cant just write a sentence in English and then throw a word from a different language. To write anything in different language I MUST switch keyboard to that language in order to use that alphabet Rod I have English and Brazilian portuguese set, and I can start a sentence in portuguese, throw in some english words and finish in portuguese, and it will auto-correct all the words automatically. I don't need to tinker with anything at all. Just like in Swiftkey. LOL That's because Brazilian uses Latin alphabet. Its impossible to type a word in a different language if it's not Latin Rod Oh, I never tried another language that doesn't use latim alphabet. My bad. Scorpiax7 How does the "multiple active languages" thing works? i need an explanation, please -.- <3 Dmytro Gulivatyy If you have multiple similar languages installed you can type in both without switching and it will understand which one you meant. It should display the languages that are used on the spacebar key below. Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms. Dmytro Gulivatyy Does anyone know why we're getting it so late? I remember people protecting Google not releasing it on Android because we had G Now on tap but I'm confused now. Mako g now on tap is somewhat hidden in Pixels, so this is a good alternative Dmytro Gulivatyy I know and I agree, but why hold out for months before finally releasing it here kinda saying "Hey, you guys can have it too, don't worry we haven't forgotten." Just feels like it. Mako yeah, I really don't know why it took so long Dmytro Gulivatyy Less resources? Harder to code for? I mean it's their OS. Maybe they didn't care enough because it's easier to search for something with the search bar always accessible, GNow on tap here, and they weren't in such a hurry. But now they come out saying this is a better way. Sometimes i cant understand their behavior. pfmiller Android already has plenty of easy ways to access Google search, so it probably wasn't a big priority. Mwikarago Christian Why doesn't auto suggestion work in chrome search bar? Any idea? Dmytro Gulivatyy It's always been like that. I don't know for sure if i'm right but i think it's because they don't want to mess up your query because it's a browser address field. Same goes for the Google search bar. They think you will want full control over what you're typing because it can get technical, unlike the usual chats you have with people in chat apps. It sometimes offers predictions itself but not always. One of the reasons i'm still with SwiftKey. Mwikarago Christian That's a weird decision on their part. The only time I need autocorrection is in the address /search bar as I usually search using recurring words. That's also the reason I'll stick with SwiftKey Dmytro Gulivatyy Yes, it's been discussed times and times again and even listed as a bug https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 but i personally don't think it's one, they would've fixed it a long time ago. For what its worth i don't understand their reasoning either, you can still type and have it write what you meant and not autocorrect it but i also have other reasons to stick with SwiftKey(one being its better at autocorrecting something when GBoard thinks it was just gibberish and has no clue) but it's getting better and has its charm too. marclee Yes it has been always like this.. I kind of understand why Google wants autocorrect disabled in chrome address bar (not agree tho), I just can't understand it is disabled in Google search bar and YouTube..... Rod That's disabled in the app. Someone on Reddit revealed the code. Pedro Diego Fernández It seems I'm the only one having problems with the keyboard...sometimes I glide I can see it's writing the word I want but when I finish it just adds a letter... and the multiple active languages is too funky to use... had to switch back to aosp :( Navin Govindani Not a big fan of the initial release as it has many problems with Spanish, doesn't suggest anything with "ñ", hell it even tries to autocorrect anything I type with it, not to mention, the occasional lag, I understand it's an initial release but please get your shit together team! MikeOxlong The versions available on apkmirror are old (6.0.65). I currently have 6.0.69 on my 6p and pixel XL direct from the play store... Rod Contact Artem, maybe you can share your apk with them? SyCoREAPER Why does the Google Keyboard fdiffer from the AOSP one? Rod AOSP version is outdated and missing the newer features. It's a bare-bones version. SyCoREAPER Aosp in my opinion is functionally superior with the long press symbols for every key Rod That's also present in Gboard. SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it. pfmiller That's an option in Gboard SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it s427 I think I'll make the switch from Swype to Gboard for good now. The only thing still missing IMO are the gesture shortcuts (copy, cut, paste, select all, change capitalization), which are super useful in Swype. So, GOOGLE IF YOU'RE LISTENING YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO! dk mke That and the exclamation and question mark short cuts as well. By far the best features of any keyboard IMO. It's why I keep going back. Rod As a long-time Swiftkey user, I deeply miss the punctuation auto-spacing. drcaveman Anyone else having the GBoard just randomly stop accepting input? I fix it by hiding and clicking the text input box again. Seems to happen more frequently in messaging apps. freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still way better than this new Google keyboard. First of all, SwiftKey is better with word predictions. Secondly, SwiftKey has emoji predictions and Google keyboard does not. And lastly, the SwiftKey emoji list of emojis scrolls down📜 very smooth and fast. But instead in the Google Keyboard that same emoji list scrolls through multiple horizontal pages instead. It's very slow and takes forever if you are texting. Mace Moneta Still no control, alt or tab key (even just the option in advanced setting would be nice), which is annoying for those of us that ssh into systems. marrecar Ok I updated the app this morning and it completely broke it. No words show up on prediction bar, double space doesn't add a dot, can't delete by swiping to the left, can't move the cursor by swiping the spacebar. Plus the emoji menu looks awful. Does anyone have the same problem? I tried deleting data first, didn't work, then I replaced it with stock version, updated and still the same. obk88 very intrigued by gboard used it for 5 days went back to swiftkey...typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying, gliding isnt as smooth and better emoji experience on swiftkey...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure Christian Wagner Jr Still too large of a keyboard. I have a Nexus 6P and with it on its smallest setting, the keyboard and the box above it take up just under half my screen! SE.Quence so what? just resize it in settings Christian Wagner Jr I did. Its set to the smallest setting. Went thru all the settings as well. If they only gave the option to make it smaller by one or 2 more sizes, I would dump swiftkey for this no problem. Not all of us have donut fingers and need keys THAT large SE.Quence Yep, I can agree that some of other keyboards can be smaller when set to smallest size. But setting GKB to lowest height is pretty decent IMO. Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Can u help me with this? Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature sachouba It only took Google 3 years to add some features available on Samsung's keyboard and SwiftKey. And Google fans sound astonished... patrick yes i had the numbers row on my S4 stock samsung keyboard. but as far as autocorrection, i always found Google keyboard to be more accurate. SE.Quence Testing new GBoard on my 2 Nexus devices. Both running 7.1.1. Dictionary sync doesnt work even when account is set and sync was forced manually. By some reason, GBoard is not presented in Google sync settings (Accounts - Google) but IDK whether it should be here. Who else is facing this? Đức Thành I've been using the APK since a few days ago and autocorrection is still as horrible as ever, especially for Vietnamese. There's no options to set the aggressiveness level of autocorrection, and it's a pain in the neck to hit backspace multiple times for every sentence I type just to go back and fix the incorrectly autocorrected words. Not to mention Gboard now tries to autocorrects whole compound words and phrases, and every time I want to say: "Yo Google keyboard, I appreciate the effort but honestly you are not doing that well since you don't know the language or how I type that well, and your ultra aggressiveness in helping me is creating more trouble than it solves, so could you stop?" In the end just now I had to turn off autocorrection altogether, and now I have to face the problem of not having autocorrection for either language. I wish there were some middle grounds, but Google is too stubbornly extreme in its ways sometimes. Sigh. dhamp2g Vietnamese? ?? Honestly dude, English only ..... LMAO it corrects English well 😂😂 Đức Thành I'm afraid I don't fully comprehend what you mean. Yes it autocorrects English very well, but it has also started supporting autocorrection for Vietnamese since Google Keyboard 5.0, and that's my native language so there's nothing wrong with using that, and since the app itself officially supports the language... Arrgh forget it, you won't get it anyway. dhamp2g I understand , I was just saying all us english speaking folk only car about english problems LMAO :) mizrulez I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't turn off the keypress pop-up in the latest update. I tried deleting data, but the option is still not there. I find the popups extremely annoying. 😏 ggggg Something extraordinary happened. Google updated Google Keyboard instead of creating another keyboard App. mwolverine i wish it would show suggestions when searching in google apps. I usually end up going back to swype because of this. Usman Nagi Only reason I am not upgrading is that I miss the no key delay feature. Is there any way to enable in this current build? It slows my typing down and I only type better with popups. Itchy_Robot Why don't they just put Google Assistant into this keyboard? Renan At least that hideous G button is optional tigerberry Oh hey, finally there's gesture typing for Hungarian! It only took... well, how many years? Too many, considering that other keyboards, even OEM keyboards have been able to do it since ages. And lemme check... yep, still no gesture typing for Japanese in QUERTY mode. Come on Google, even Huawei's keyboard can do it! (I miss the Xperia keyboard. :( I wish it was available for non-Sony phones...) Gwaur I wish there was a way to completely hide the extra row where that G icon is. I found a setting for hiding the icon but the row stayed. It's a goddamn waste of space for someone who's not gonna use it. Fahad Ahmed Why there's no Chinese language included??? That's disappointing. Természetjáró Gayboard. Sorry, I'll show myself out... Patel Nisha I would be happy with a backspace key! Or better still, when using a stylus, thus knowing I went to each letter precisely when swaping, the damn thing would input my entry versus some substitute word! Marco Reali I love GBOARD but two things are very very frustrating: 1. There is no suggestion bar when typing in Chrome. 2. The language switch takes to long to recognise which language I'm typing. I wish they woul reinstate the button for those who want that. I switch language pretty often and I find it horrible to have to re-type words over and over before it's in the right language. WestIndiesKING anyone else getting a little bit of lag when you first start it up after a while of not pulling up the keyboard? I am getting 1-3 seconds of lag before it starts only if i havent used it in a while, after that it flies. Pixel XL 128gb Daddyo Gordon Am I the only one who feels the google keyboard has gotten bloated and too big? There should be an option to keep it at one language, as pioneered by monolingual on the mac (gets rid of a couple Gb of unused languages that waste storage).

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

It aims to restore the Nokia brand to what it once was, and it thinks Google’s Android can help. But unlike other Android device makers that are all churning out the same black rectangles, the new Nokia has something else in mind. But it will only work with Google’s help. Don't Miss: Scientist studying acoustic vibrations decides to make life hell for some Lego dudes Nokia said during its press event at MWC that its Android phones, including the Nokia 6, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3 that are about to launch, will run a clean version of Android — or as close to vanilla Android as possible, the kind of Android OS some fans crave. Furthermore, Nokia said on stage that it plans to issue swift updates to Android, a feat no other smartphone maker can brag with. Talking to Gulf News, HMD Global’s vice president for the Middle East and North Africa Per Ekman reiterated some of those goals, revealing that Google might be the key to making Nokia great again. Apparently, HMD Global clinched some important strategic partnership with Foxconn and Google. “Most of the smartphones in the market do not have the Android OS in the way it should be,” the exec said. “Vendors are adding a skin on top of the OS. Consumers have the right to have the latest version of the OS, and we will be pushing the latest version and the patches as soon as it is available from Google.” “We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant,” he said. That sounds amazing, at least in theory. But running pure Android on a phone also sounds like something not even Google is doing anymore. For the first time since Android’s inception, Google last year confirmed that it wants to further customize its own Android smartphones. The Pixel that followed was a Prime example of that, sporting some features that were not initially available on older Nexus models. On the other hand, Google’s primary Android partner has just taken the first significant anti-Android move. Samsung’s Bixby is a direct competitor to Google’s Assistant and a potential threat to Google in the long run. Working closely with a company that can sell Nokia-branded Android phones, a brand still loved by millions of people, might be in Google’s best interest. HMD Global’s next major test comes soon. The first Nokia Android phones are tipped to launch in 120 markets in late May or early June.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Google's lawyer has called the lawsuit a "fishing expedition." Kim Jin-a/AP hide caption toggle caption Kim Jin-a/AP The Department of Labor is suing Google to obtain payroll data to determine whether the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. Google's lawyer has called the lawsuit a "fishing expedition." Kim Jin-a/AP Just three days after Google announced that it had "closed the gender pay gap globally" on Equal Pay Day, a Department of Labor official testified in federal court that there is "systemic" discrimination against women at Google. Silicon Valley has often come under fire in recent years for being unfriendly to women, with sexual harassment allegations and lawsuits over gender bias. But a DoL official told The Guardian Friday that Google's discrimination was "extreme," even for the industry. The government is suing Google, a government contractor, to release compensation data in order to make sure the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. In a press release about the lawsuit, the DoL said that Google has had "many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily," but has "refused to do so." Google, for its part, has denied that the company has a gender discrimination problem, and called the DoL's request a "fishing expedition." Harin Contractor was an economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor under President Obama, and he says the pay gap is complicated. There are a number of factors that contribute, including women taking time out of the workforce for maternity leave, or to care for aging parents or other relatives. But there is a portion of the pay gap that can't be accounted for by these situations. "These companies need to try a little harder to encourage diversity," Contractor says, adding that often in the tech industry the people making hiring and promotion decisions are white men. "Sometimes they can get caught up in their bubble and feel like they're very open," he says. "But when it's always the same type of person making the decisions. ... maybe it's not conscious." For the past several years, Google has released its diversity data publicly in an annual report, that has shown a persistent dearth of women and minorities at the top. Last year, women represented just 31 percent of Google's workforce, and held just 24 percent of leadership roles.

From Building More Data Centers (GOOG) How Google’s Machine Learning Chip Saved The Co. From Building More Data Centers (GOOG) Suddenly, the future of neural networking has gotten more interesting. April 9, 2017 WSP About six years ago, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) realized they were facing a serious challenge that would have cost them plenty hadn’t they figured out an innovative way around it. This was the situation: if all of Google’s Android users accessed their voice recognition services for just three minutes per day, to be able to handle all the requests to the machine learning system powering those services, they would have needed twice as many data centers (spanning 15 locations in four continents) from what they had. That would have of course entailed a significant amount of investment. Rather than purchase more land and build more data centers, the search giant opted to create new hardware specifically designed to run and power machine-learning systems, including voice recognition. And Google’s solution shall forever be known as its Tensor Processing Unit (or TPUs). It was in May 2016 when Google first talked about this custom-made processor. And now, almost a year later, details about the project have finally been revealed. The company recently released a paper discussing how the TPUs work and what specific problems it can solve. In simplest terms, a TPU is a computer chip that’s designed to speed up the ‘thinking phase’ of deep neural networks — those complicated mathematical systems that can think, reason and learn how to do certain tasks and solve problems by analyzing huge amounts of data. Based on the tests done, Google’s TPU did considerably better than other comparable chips like Intel’s Haswell CPU and NVIDIA’s K80 GPU. Specifically, it ran 15 – 30 times faster at machine-learning inference tasks and did 30 – 80 times better in terms of performance per watt. And that’s just the beginning. Because Google claims there’s still room for more improvement. To be clear, Google isn’t the first to use a dedicated chip for executing neural networks. Microsoft and China’s Internet giant Baidu are doing it as well. What differentiates Google’s effort is that it built its chip from scratch. Technically known as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), Google chose to go this route instead of using programmable FPGA chips (like those used by Microsoft) because they prioritized speed rather than programmability. They built the chip for one specific task: to execute neural networks. This doesn’t mean, however, that it won’t be able to do anything else. As Norman Jouppi (one of Google’s distinguished hardware engineers who developed the chip) explained to NextPlatform: “The TPU is programmable like a CPU or GPU. It isn’t designed for just one neural network model; it executes CISC instructions on many networks (convolutional, LSTM models, and large, fully connected models). So it is still programmable, but uses a matrix as a primitive instead of a vector or scalar.” For now, the TPU’s sole purpose is to execute neural networks; training those neural networks isn’t part of its function. As limited and specific as its role is, however, having this chip saved Google from spending quite a lot. It has also established another area where Google can potentially excel — neural networking. In a blog post they shared, Jouppi said: “We’re committed to building the best infrastructure and sharing those benefits with everyone. We look forward to sharing more updates in the coming weeks and months.” References: Wired GOOG Previous article Next article Related Articles Business Google Releases Statement On Apple (AAPL) Vs Samsung August 27, 2012 WSP News Notable Upgrades: Google Inc.

Let Us Know! Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android applications that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous 2 weeks or so. Please wait for this page to load in full in order to see the widgets, which include ratings and pricing info. Looking for the previous roundup editions? Find them here. Featured App Accu Battery Today's roundup is presented by Accu Battery from Digibites. Batteries today are ubiquitous with just about every device we use, as they play a critical role in our day-to-day that is difficult to dismiss. This means that it is pretty important to stay on top of your battery usage. Keeping track of what is using too much battery or just checking your current usage projections can be plenty helpful when out and about, as every spare milliamp-hour can be crucial in getting things done. Luckily Accu Battery is here to keep us informed, that way our batteries can run longer and more efficiently. -- Accu Battery protects battery health, displays battery usage information, and measures battery capacity (mAh) based on science. Batteries have a limited lifespan. Every time you charge your device, it wears out the battery, lowering its total capacity. Scientific research shows that battery lifespan can be extended up to 200%, when you charge your device to only 80%. Accu Battery measures the actual battery usage using information from the battery charge controller. Battery usage per app is determined by combining these measurements with information on which app is in the foreground. Android calculates battery usage using pre-baked profiles that device manufacturers provide, like how much power the CPU uses. In practice however, these numbers tend to be highly inaccurate. Measure real battery capacity (in mAh). Use the charge alarm to prolong battery lifespan. See how much wear your battery sustains with each charge session. Look up the discharge speed and battery consumption per app. Remaining charge time - know how long it takes before your battery is charged. Remaining use time - know when you will run out of battery. Screen on or screen off estimations. Check the percentage of deep sleep, when the device is in standby mode. Ongoing notification for real time battery statistics at a glance. Pro Features Real-time CPU and power usage overlay for spotting battery draining processes. Use Dark and AMOLED black themes to save energy. Access to historical sessions older than 1 day. Detailed battery statistics in notification. No ads Download: Accu Battery (Play Store) Apps Personal Shopping Assistant Android Police coverage: Microsoft Personal Shopping Assistant arrives on the Play Store, as a beta Microsoft's Personal Shopping Assistant -- as the name suggests -- is a personal shopping assistant that helps you by keeping track of your online shopping habits. Previously it was limited to a browser extension on Windows and macOS machines, it can now keep track of your shopping on Android too. Currently, this is not officially released as it is listed as "Unreleased" on the Play Store. That means there may be a few bugs or unfinished features to contend with if you install today. Luckily, Personal Shopping Assistant is completely free to download and use, so you are at least not paying for the privilege of beta testing for Microsoft. -- Your personal shopping assistant automatically remembers all the products you shop for on the web, on your PC or Mac and now on the phone. This is a companion app to the assistant on the browser on your PC or Mac. Sign in to the app and see all the products you shopped for on your PC or Mac. The companion app also automatically remembers products you browse on the phone. These products are added to your "mobile" board automatically and you can see them on your PC or Mac with the Personal Shopping Assistant on the browser. Download: Personal Shopping Assistant (Play Store) Google Family Link Google Family Link is a new app from Google that allows you to create and manage accounts for your kids. Specifically, this is for creating accounts for kids under the age of thirteen. Once the account is created, you are given finite controls over what apps they use and how long they can use them. One thing to keep in mind, Google Family Link does not currently support account migration. So if your kid already has an account, you will be unable to migrate it to a new account that supports Family Link's services. Hopefully, that is something we will see added in the future. Google Family Link is free with zero in-app purchases or advertisements. -- The Family Link app from Google helps you stay in the loop as your kid (under 13) explores on their Android device. Family Link lets you create a Google Account for your kid that’s like your account, while also helping you set certain digital ground rules for your family. With a Google Account, your kid will be able to use Google’s broad ecosystem of services for the first time. Family Link can help you to: Manage the apps your kid can use - Approve or block the apps your kid wants to download from the Google Play store. Keep an eye on screen time - See how much time your kid spends on their favorite apps with weekly or monthly activity reports, and set daily screen time limits. Set device bedtime - Remotely lock your kid’s device when it’s time for bed, or time to take a break.

This means that those of us who prefer them to paper will more than likely pay a premium. Thankfully this is where libraries come into play. They often carry many different audiobooks and e-books that you can borrow for free. The one caveat is that it can be difficult for some of us to get the needed files onto our target device and find an app that can open them. Libby looks to solve this issue by not only showing you exactly which e-books and audiobooks your local library has available but it allows you to read or listen to them in the app itself. That means you need not worry about finding a compatible app for any of the specific files you just borrowed. Just like libraries, Libby is completely free to use.

Today we have another one to add to the pile. Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger is an app that is focused around leaving voice messages for your friends and family. The interesting tidbit here is that once a message has been listened to, it disappears. What practicality this adds to one's messaging I am unsure, but who am I to judge? If you want to leave your friends non-permanent voice messages, I am sure you have plenty of good reasons to do so. Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger is completely free with zero advertisements or in-app purchases. -- Welcome to Supersonic, an exciting new way to keep up with your friends. Send live voice messages and see emojis as you speak. Read my lips: Messages are converted to text so your friends can read ‘em even if they aren’t able to listen. Freely express yourself: Messages disappear after they’ve been heard. Keep it personal with one-on-one chats, or include the whole gang in a group.   Download: Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger (Play Store) Oversec There are a few apps already out there that offer encrypted messaging but they run into the same problem all startup messengers have. There is no easy way to get a mass of people onto the same platform. Oversec has found a way around this issue by not being a messaging app in and of itself but by working in tandem with the messengers everyone already uses. No matter your preferred messaging app, you can apply encrypted messaging by utilizing Oversec over top that app. While Oversec is free to download, there are a few in-app purchases that range up to $109.99. Luckily the majority of higher prices are for government use or considered more as a donation. You can receive all the app has to offer for $0.99. -- Oversec transparently encrypts and decrypts any text in any app. You can use it to exchange private encrypted and covert chat- or email messages or store your own encrypted notes on your phone. Oversec is completely agnostic of the subjacent app, it works with Whatsapp™, Line™, Snapchat™, Instagram™ or any other chat app. Encrypted data is only decrypted while it is shown on the screen. No clear text is ever persisted and thus cannot be extracted from the file system or accidentally be backed up into the cloud. We also carefully designed Oversec so that it doesn't require internet access. Because of that, you can rest assured that no decrypted information can ever leave your device. Download: Oversec (Play Store) GrammarPal If you are similar to me, in that you are a product of America's public school system, you may be in need of some help with your grammar from time to time. GrammarPal is a tool specifically aimed at helping in this area. More than just a spell checker, GrammarPal is a whiz at correcting common English grammar mistakes. You can try the app out for free and there is a single in-app purchase of $1.99 that will unlock its pro-level features. -- GrammarPal checks your texts for grammatical errors. Unlike the spell checker that's built into your phone, this app aims to also find all other kinds of grammatical errors. Be it spelling, style or any other form of error, GrammarPal helps you find and fix them. Scan your texts for errors directly from any app. Instantly see the number of errors in your text after the scan. Replace errors with the correct words or phrases. Add new words to your custom dictionary so they don't show as errors. Choose the kind of errors you want the app the app to ignore. Disable error checking in any app by adding the app to your blacklist.   Download: GrammarPal (Play Store) Tucano for Twitter - Beta Tucano for Twitter is a new material design focused Twitter app. It is currently in an open beta with only a handful of features included so far. The developer has mentioned they will be adding more in the next few updates. Currently, Tucano for Twitter costs $2.99 upfront and there are no in-app purchases or advertisements to be seen. -- Tucano is a brand new Twitter client for Android. Using material design, the app brings a very comfortable and customizable interface. It also provides unique features currently not available on other apps like: Profile stats Profile note Real time view for interactions Favorite users fixed on the top for quick access And many more coming in the next updates. Download: Tucano for Twitter - Beta (Play Store) Mathemagics Multiplication Mathemagics Multiplication is a kid oriented multiplication table memorization app. It is aimed at teaching kids who find it difficult to memorize their multiplication tables. Each exercise that is offered is kid friendly and designed around making the whole experience fun and light-hearted. Mathemagics Multiplication is free to download, with a single in-app purchase of $4.99 available for those that would like to purchase the entirety of its content. -- With this free version, kids can try out multiplication tables for the number 4.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch. That's my favorite thing a out keep being my grocery list.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 302 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares447 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Middlefinger Sorry I meant LP. Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? YaKillaCJ Updates do actually roll out to Xiaomi devices. This means that they also get security patches. Also across a wide variety of devices. mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. Middlefinger Except that you haven't demonstrated why im a hypocrite, at all. whispy_snippet I don't have to. You're doing it all by yourself. Middlefinger Nope, dont see anything hypocritical here. Not fitting your narrative doesn't equal hypocritical you know.. whispy_snippet "Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.." Do you have any idea how stupid this looks? Middlefinger Well Tizen isn't even theirs, you know that right? Like Android sort of was/is its open source, developed by the Linux Foundation. Samsung is a member and is using it. Its not as commonly used and isnt as well developed as Android, but it is at least independent of Googles dictatorship. I still see no hypocrisy there, i guess you dont know what the word actually means. whispy_snippet Geez, you're like Tim. Middlefinger So you couldn't argue, so used a straw man. Got it. whispy_snippet No, I'm wasting my energy on someone too egotistic and deluded to accept rhyme or reason. You're not just a hypocrite Samsung shill, you're deliberately obtuse and tedious to interact with. You're a waste of time. Middlefinger Again, no , i just dont agree with you. There is clear anti-samsung bias on here, from both the commenters and the contributors, even if its often covered by the begrudging acceptance that they make the best products. You keep thinking im a Samsung shill if you like, and wasting your time commenting based on that erroneous position. I will just carry on telling it as I see it, when Google does bad and Samsung does bad. whispy_snippet "even if its often covered by the begrudging acceptance that they make the best products." Perfect. Middlefinger Ill bite. Who makes better? HTC, nope. Sony? Niche at best, stale design. LG, floundering, but the G6 is at least good. OnePlus, oh please. Moto/Lenovo hahahaa. Pixel? Only if you are a SJW for AOSP. Huawei/ZTE etc. Not really, the hardware is lacking, the software often poor, the quality is superficial. Fact is the Galaxy S at least is clearly the best device. Its the most sorted and reliable, has the best hardware, the best design, the best software (desite what said AOSP fanboys think). whispy_snippet Game, set and match. Middlefinger OK so you aren't going to argue, that's fine, I guess you cant. People who wont state their position are unsure of it, you dont want to state your alternative best because you know it will get shot down. I guess this IS a waste of time. Your Blocked.. whispy_snippet Bye Tim II. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. keithzg Other than the Enlightenment dev(s), there really isn't anyone other than Samsung who wrote the distro currently known as Tizen; when Tizen was forked from MeeGo, Samsung devs threw out all the Qt work that had been done by Nokia and Intel, which pretty much just leaves the Linux kernel, heh. And if you look at the git commits it's pretty much just Samsung employees. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? Middlefinger I guess you know the history of Android, right? Its not originally Googles, and much of the code in current Android is community based, so again, not Google. M. Luciano You're out of your element Donnie. Middlefinger The only thing that bothers me here is the torrent of apologists and fanboys. Its hard to battle 10+ delusional people all at once. Nothing i said wasn't true, and yet again someone is arguing without providing any actual argument. M. Luciano Yeah that was because you didn't address my point and brought up something totally different that just sounds tangentially related, yet isn't. The issue is that Samsung is woefully ignorant of security best practices and the same cannot be said of Google, who is providing Samsung with the vast majority of their Android security related code. Yes, some of it comes from AOSP, but most of it comes from Google, regardless of whether or not they invented the OS. Middlefinger Tizen isnt a samsung OS, its open source. Its behind Android yes, but its improving as you can see if you actually look. Samsungs mistake might be using it at all, but it was kind of forced to do something because for the uses Samsung has for Tizen (its watches mainly), Android is god awful. Android was a terrible mess at the start to, and while Tizen isnt new, its got nothing like the activity Android gets. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ? Middlefinger But Tizen isnt Samsungs, its developed by the Linux Foundation and is open source. Samsung might use it, and help develop it, but its not their creation. At this point its just in a position that Android was maybe 8 years ago. Samsung is using it because its free of Googles controlling. JG This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places Why not error on the side of caution, encrypt everything! John Samuel αΩ This will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever experienced Samsung's software.

Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares165 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests,their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. Its got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buy a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use.

Thanks. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I would say OmniROM. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-9/orig-development/omnirom-pre-weeklies-flounder-t3537414 buxbaum3055 Dirty Unicorns is working fine on mine 7-down PA is a poor excuse of a ROM. They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick PhantomGamers I managed to brick my N6 by fastboot flashing the latest update, making sure it boots, and then locking my bootloader which then caused me to bootloop when starting. Tried everything to unbrick it, but couldn't reunlock it because it required me to toggle a setting in developer options which would have required it to boot in the first place. I guess pro tip would be to always wipe data FIRST and then confirm it boots before relocking bootloader. TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools.

AA seeks Google's help to beat Auckland's road congestion 5:20 PM Friday Apr 7, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Auckland Region NZ Automobile Association Traffic Auckland's rapid population growth has led to a quarter of the city's busiest roads being congested at peak hours. Photo / Google Maps Internet giant Google and its map app may help to reduce the daily stress of Auckland's traffic chaos. The Automobile Association is using data collected from the Google Map app at more than 50 busy routes across Auckland to better understand the causes and effects of congestion. There are plans for monthly reports on congestion trends, a possible television slot, advice for planned events such as the Adele concerts and holiday traffic and immediate responses for unplanned events like car crashes and road closures. "We think this will lead to a more informed debate. That means keeping public expectations real and cutting out political promises of 'silver bullet' solutions," said AA infrastructure principal adviser Barney Irvine. Auckland's rapid population growth has led to a quarter of the city's busiest roads, including Lake Rd, Lincoln Rd and routes to the airport, being congested at peak hours, up from 18 per cent in just three years. Auckland Transport said one in three main roads will be congested by 2020. The city has grown by 121,000 people in the past three years - the size of Tauranga - and 122,000 new cars over the same period. Every week, 800 new cars are registered in the city. Huge gains in public transport are not taking the pressure off the motorways and local roads. Motorway speeds have fallen from 64km/h to 55km/h at peak hours between 2014 and 2016 and the morning crawl on the Southern Motorway from Papakura to the city has dragged out from 46 to 67 minutes in just three years.

Photo / Doug Sherring Irvine said for a long time there had not been enough analysis of congestion issues. "Government agencies gather data, but it doesn't find its way to the public. We saw an important opportunity for the AA to step in and fill the vacuum. "The idea is to help demystify congestion for the public. By focusing on the bigger picture and talking about what people can do to minimise some of congestion's impacts, we can help to reduce some of the stress," Irvine said. The AA began collecting the Google data in about October last year. It is also collecting data in Wellington and Christchurch. - NZ Herald Read more by Bernard Orsman Email Bernard Orsman Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Kamo gain revenge over OBM Tom Herman's long-range penalty was the difference in Kamo's win over Old Boys Marist… Hawke's Bay Today Linda Hall: Big cracks appear in bargain-pottery market Linda Hall column Bay of Plenty Times Tommy Kapai: Be brave and tell New Zealand's saddest stories There were two memorable battles among locals last Saturday.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Assistant shopping lists moving from Keep to Home app starting April 10 Newsby Dan Bartram13 hours ago 18 220 20 One of the most handy features Google Assistant offers is the ability to create shopping lists via voice control. Whenever you think of a new item to add to your list, just say “Ok Google, add blank to my shopping list.” The Assistant will then add that item to a list located in Google Keep. It’s pretty useful, but that’s going to change starting April 10. According to a recently uncovered Google support page, your shopping list created in Google Assistant will be moved to the Google Home and Express apps as a more natural placement to accompany the ordering and delivery features with the product. If you don’t want your shopping lists migrated automatically, you are advised to delete them from Keep. See also: What voice commands can I use with Google Home? November 10, 2016 The move is inevitably to align lists to the shopping services offered via Google Express and to consolidate where information is stored. Google Home has been rolling out the ability to shop and order items just by using your voice over the last few months through Google Express with over 50 retail partners. Following April 10 when the big changeover occurs, items added via Google Assistant can only be viewed by tapping the list icon in the Express and Home apps. Does this move makes things simpler for users of Google Home and Express? Drop us a comment below and let us know your thoughts.

By Mary Papenfuss U.S. Labor Department officials said they have found “systemic compensation disparities against women” at Google. Investigators said they discovered the pay disparity during a routine probe to make certain that Google complied with federal law because the company is a government contractor, The Wall Street Journal reported. Officials made the accusation Friday at a hearing before a federal administrative judge in San Francisco. The department is suing Google for more data on compensation to complete its probe. Google immediately shot back in a statement to The Guardian, which first revealed the Labor Department accusations. The company said it “vehemently disagrees” with the charge, adding that the Labor Department failed to show how it reached its conclusion.  Google boasted days earlier on Twitter that it had closed the gender pay gap not only in the U.S. — but globally as well.

It sued Oracle in January, claiming that it paid white men more than other employees for similar work, which Oracle denied.  Related Coverage What’s The Truth About The Gender Pay Gap?

Google confirms wider Assistant rollout will not reach tablets Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/16 6:00am PDTMar 16, 2017 116 Plus 1 on G+ 107 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares287 Google News When Google announced that the Assistant would start rolling out to devices running Android 6.0 and above, there was one little detail we didn't pay close attention to: the official blog post only talked about "smartphones," "Android phones," and "Android partner phones." Tablets? Nada. So when the rollout started earlier this month and more and more phones received Assistant with nary a sign of a tablet getting the same treatment, many of our readers were left wondering: will tablets get Assistant? We've reached out to Google and got an official answer that's sure to break some hearts: The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets. Straight from the horse's mouth. You can stop trying to tap and hold your home button to summon up Assistant on your tablet, that's not going to work. What you can do more productively is learn how to edit your build.prop file to circumvent the limitation. That trick has been possible since November on any Android Nougat device, even when the Assistant was exclusive to Pixel phones. We followed up with Google asking whether they had a timeline for an official release on tablets, but they refused to comment further. That doesn't rule out the possibility of tablets getting Assistant ever, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. Or at least I would, but very cautiously.

Cael Who is making Android tablets? D in B exactly Phoenix That only means more fragmentation IMO, even if there is only a small market share for tablets. Knowledgeborn Allah It wouldn't create more fragmentation at all. They're releasing the update through Google Play Services for all devices (see: smartphones) running on Marshmallow or higher. The fact that it's pushed through GPS means there's a conscious effort for them NOT to include it in Android tablets, and they're creating more fragmentation by not just adding it in with all the other devices. bekifft Google. But it should come as no surprise that they immediately got distracted by something shiny and dropped support in a shockingly short amount of time. Cael The Pixel C came out in 2015.... bekifft True. So they're supporting it for less time than they would a phone. For something that's supposed to be closer to a proper computer that's pretty pathetic. Gaurav Arora No one ever has answers as to why Google takes certain decision, and at this stage, I'm not even sure people at Google know why they take certain decisions. Phoenix Exactly, Google is shoots itself in the foot and makes us watch . Pessimippopotamus Probably prioritizing the rollout for phones (which makes sense) and doesn't have a time table yet for tablet rollout. I don't think it's a weird conspiracy to screw over tablet users like some people think. Phoenix I don't think they are 'intentionally' screwing over tablet owners but then again, I don't think it's time related. They specifically said android phones not android devices on their blog which signifies the rollout is just for phones ( and now AP confirmed it ). it will be confusing for tablet users ( like myself) if they begin using assistant daily on their smartphones and not have it when they're using their tablets. personally I don't see why... Pessimippopotamus It's not like existing services are disabled on tablets. Functionality is like 95% the same, and content is synced, so... It's Google probably doing its thing that it does: painfully drawn out rollout to see if it screws anything up. Qbancelli Because they want people to use the Assistant with Google Home derp_cookies Because the users didn't ask for it. CheCorchete So seems like android tables are dead for Google :( Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ tablets have been dead for a few years, so might as well start killing features coming to them demarcmj They were never really alive. There were a few years where Google and manufacturers were trying to make them a thing, but they never caught on. We're finally starting to reach the point where people are giving up. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ agreed. its sad to see, but understandable. demarcmj I foresee the same thing happening to Android Wear in a year or two. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ i know. I wish it caught on more, love my smart watches. but as of right now, its appearing to be for a niche market. personally, I think it boils down to options. anyone knows they can wait it out a couple of months for something better. why buy now? Roy Sadly, it's mostly because tablet support from Google has been absolutely awful, and that surely has kept developers away from them as well. Then the fact that the PC market has been turning out very nice small form factor laptops and convertible tablets... Why would anyone buy a sort-of-works-ok android tablet when they can have an iPad or a fully featured Windows 10 tablet/laptop that can do just about anything? It's absolutely ridiculous that they only added multi window support in Nougat! F4LL0U7 I've had it on my 5X for a few days, and for the life of me, I can't figure out what the benefit is over its predecessor. I thought I'd be able to type to it (like in Allo), but I can't. I thought it would have a stream of my previous searches (also like in Allo), but it doesn't. Literally all it has is that dumb circle face. It can't even control my Nest account (because I only have a camera and not a thermostat) or order me a Domino's pizza (because that only works with a Home device). Roy Yeah same here. If anything it seems to have fewer features than the Google Search it's trying to replace. "What song is this?" "I can't do that"... "When is my next bill due?" "I can't do that". etc etc. Jeffrey Heesch Or "Okay Google, navigate to..." which is something I do all the time while driving... or, well, used to do. I was both shocked and frustrated when I realized Assistant couldn't do that. Drakenoid I can do that... whispy_snippet Yes it can. Jeffrey Heesch That's weird. When I tried it a couple days ago it told me it didn't know how to do that yet, so I haven't tried since. I just tried again right now and it's working. Guess it was just bugging out on me before. Paul_Werner Pull up your Google Feed and perform the voice inquiry from there and those commands still work. It's not as easy as just saying, "OK Google" without touching the device but it's still there Roy Speaking of which, it also now doesn't respond if I say "OK Google" when the screen is off or locked anymore - I checked the settings and it's still set up to respond from any screen, but now... no response. But yes, that is true, and I'm glad they left a way to use the "legacy" Google Now (or whatever they call it now) functionality. Dn Bro Not trying to defend anything here, but keep in mind this rollout just started. I'm guessing that Google is working on getting all the different assistants together as much as possible, but that right now it is pretty fragmented. I know for me, I using the Assistant for quite a few things such as searches, asking for phone numbers, etc. But as you said, the old Google thing did that too. What I CAN do now is control my Philip Hue lighting with the phone. I can fluently say Ok Google, turn the lights down to 50% in the kitchen, and it will. F4LL0U7 That's pretty cool. The Nest integration (or lack thereof) is just really frustrating. I'm dying to just say "OK Google, set Nest to away" as I walk out my door. It's not clear to me if it's not working because the integration isn't there yet, or if it's because I only have a camera and no thermostat. codemonkey85 >> "Not trying to defend anything here, but keep in mind this rollout just started. I'm guessing that Google is working on getting all the different assistants together as much as possible, but that right now it is pretty fragmented." Unfortunately, Google keeps talking up its AI game, but when it replaces one with another, less capable, more fragmented one that's only available on a few devices - well, what kind of reaction are they expecting? The fact that Assistant doesn't even have the same capabilities on different platforms is worse yet. Ryan The only advantage I have seen is it has more robust Google home controls so I can do more with my smartthings controller. Well, that and its back to playing nice with Google Home with regards to who handles my request. Morten Ulv I can turn on my stereo, projector and game consoles through Harmony, and my lights through Hue. I love it! Pessimippopotamus I miss Now on Tap's screen search. Google Assistant has parts of it, but I can't highlight specific terms or anything like that. That said, it's been more responsive for me than before in terms of voice recognition? Deeco Should rename Alphabet to AlphaBeta or just Google Beta Good_Ole_Pinocchio What's the point? Google doesn't have any tablet hardware they're directly supporting so why bother? They're no one is releasing yearly tablets the Android tablet space is dead until Google decides to get back into the game. Sashank Narayan They still sell the Pixel C. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Pixel C is less than a year away from being past its 2 year update cycle. They need new hardware. Nick Doesn't change the fact that they are currently supporting it. alvester Not fully supporting it though. You can't get repairs done on it. I have a cracked screen on my Pixel C and have been talking to support for over a month about having it repaired. The rep I've been emailing has been very cordial but apparently they don't have any kind of repair service setup. Even if you wanted to pay for a repair it can't be done. For me on a productivity level I love my Pixel C but buyer beware in this regard. Sashank Narayan Agreed. But as Nick said, Google is still supporting it. MJ Google is rolling Assistant out to ANY phone (aka non-Google phones) that runs Android 6.0 or higher... The fact that Google is not really in the tablet market anymore (at this point) seems to be irrelevant. Why wouldn't they want Assistant to be as widespread as possible again? Excluding tablets makes no sense... They looking for a competitor to take that market segment over? Diskus1 iPad does all of this, in 21 languages... Google is trying REALLY HARD to fail... Nick That's a shame. I was hoping they'd bring it to my dusty tablet that hasn't been charged in months. George so now that Google Assistant is dead for Tablets, you have to wonder what 'taimen' really is... Good_Ole_Pinocchio Everyone who leaked said yesterday that their source said it was a phone and not a tablet. Droid Life and AP George Literally the AP Headline: Google may be working on a large third phone or TABLET, codenamed 'taimen' Good_Ole_Pinocchio AP headline is irrelevant when it comes to the actual people writing the articles. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/41b6486b0d4eafb0a044b42274f3a5b27ca2127cc887ca257d66d9aed33c67e8.png George so... AP is click-bait? lol Good_Ole_Pinocchio It's all rumor, so they're just being as general as possible. Kike Martinez Bernet Yes, some news they have are empty of content like the one talking about the name of an unknown new device... MJ We don't have confirmed information at this point so "'taimen'" could be something besides a standard phone. Cael But what if it is a 7 inch phone? George is that the new Google phone in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?? ;p Indefinite Implosion Could be that it is a tablet and will be the first and only tablet with assistant when it launches, as with the initial Pixel phone launch. bekifft It probably is a tablet. Google loves to release tablets and then instantly drop support for them. So whatever it is, don't make the mistake of buying it. Eric Braun That's why when I do buy a tablet it's usually a Samsung. It won't be a timely update but they generally get updated a bit longer than the rest officially. George Google loves to release *replace with any Google services* and then instantly drop support for them. ftfy geeq I got a 1St gen nexus 7... Rocking Nougat, though it's custom built, runs smooth as it was factory. Only buy a device where there's good development, so if the manufacturer screws you over/ends support, you can still get updates via the community. Marty Just make it available for my Moto X 2014 and I'll be fine. 😉 ast00 And why is that? Another nail in the Nexus 9 coffin? Kyle Ruggles If you're rooted, just get "Get Assistant" from Google play, gives you assistant in a snap. Rox Member the Pixel C, Google? Diskus1 Nope... cause it was only ever available in a handful of countries. Another Google fail. eddiepearson Tablet? Whats that? I use my Moto 360 more than I would a tablet. JD Google's head is really really really far up it's own ass that it's the head again... just with neck skin over it. derp_cookies You officially killed me Rol And The rollout is very strange. I Got the assistant yesterday on my g3 . Then i played around with it (mainly turining on of my hue lights) and then it went back to google now without me changing any settingis... I tried restarting but nothing helped. Then i went to the google assistant webpage and did a goole now screen search and the assistant is there again. ( I dont know if it was a coincidence or a trigger) ... very strange Alex Exactly....The whole roll out system they use is crap. Google knows it but do nought to fix it....Slaves to Samsung! Zargh Who knows, maybe they're working on a separate tablet-optimized layout/featureset which isn't finished yet. Stoneule Again, google/android has been awful since Sundar took over. Failures left and right. At this point I'm hoping samsung can just build their own os (that doesn't suck, mind you) and can squeeze android to the 3rd world where they so desperately want to be. And this is coming from a diehard nexus user, android tv/ android wear adopter. Dmitry Stepanushkin Yep, I wish Hugo Barra return to Google and make something great like he did in 2013... Unfortunately it will not happen I guess 😢 Kawshik Ahmed 3rd World country don't have most of the Google services anyway like Google Assistant. So they are not complaining anyway. selonmoi "I'm hoping samsung can just build their own os (that doesn't suck, mind you)" Spoiler: They can't. Stoneule Sadly, all too true. Eric Braun Tizen is great on smaller devices or devices with a limited range of usage. Watches, TVs, even a fridge. Phones and multipurpose devices is where it stumbles. Jens Knutson Yeah, the Pixel has been such a flop. Sad! Stoneule I'd agree the pixel is a good phone. If you could buy one. makapav Dude - Google has been aweful way before Sundar. Stop politicking everything. Hangouts, Huddle, Messenger, half-baked Google+ launch, Picasa flip-flopping, Google Voice...these were all half-assed junk way before Sundar. Pessimippopotamus As if Samsung will suddenly commit to long term software support for non-flagship devices, which is frankly hilarious. Tristian Hill Now (or more specifically, I/O) is the time for Google to launch a Pixel C2 with a 9 or 10" screen (4K would be lovely, but I'd settle for 1440p), 4:3 aspect ratio, good SoC, high RAM, 32GB minimum storage and an SD card would be brilliant, and stock Android with Assistant. Essentially a Nexus 9 without the memory leak that makes an otherwise perfect device near unusable for me. I love my tab for watching media on the go; YouTube, live TV, Netflix and photos/recorded video where a HQ tab screen really shines. I'd hate to have to do all that on my 5.5" phone screen, or worse... A Windows laptop/convertible that loses a lot of great Android apps which are designed to be used on the go. I think the next job is see if there is a Pixel C successor, see if Andromeda does launch, and if neither of those things happen, look at a touchscreen Chromebook that works with Android apps. Samarth Still didn't get it on my Nexus6p :( Sashank Narayan Have you set your primary system language to English (US) or English (UK)? ddevito Tablets? What are those? Ionut Lala This is such a stupid and artificial limitation. :| Victor Garcia I am yet to see a device with 1GB of RAM add Google assistant. I believe RAM may also be a limitation. DragoCubed Sometimes I wonder if Google has a long term plan for Android. I don't know why Google wouldn't just do it. Why not Cakefish Assistant still not available in UK. Charlie Callow I have Assistant in the UK in UK English on my Pixel XL since launch and as of yesterday my Nexus 6P got it too so it is available here but the roll-out to non-pixel phones has only just begun. Cakefish I mean on non-Nexus/Pixel phones. Alex Bloody hell, this rollout is shit, I've got a Nexus 5x in Australia 3 weeks plus no assistant. Now becoming a joke her in Oz...If your going to advertise a rollout at a certain time fucking do it... Google just keeps fucking around with their whole update system. Be a bit fair dinkum Google and do as you say.....Google in the trenches beside you....You wouldn't trust the cunts!!! Alex I don't like Samsung, but it's probably the time to stick it up Google and yes to build their own OS. This sort of shit has been going on toooo looking! Apple OS is shit too, I've owned a couple of phones, the 3g and the 5 but I turned to Android because it was better at that time IMO. Now I'm going back because of all this update shit that Google puts us through. Go for it Samsung, THE TIME IS RIGHT NOW!!! Eric Braun I just don't think Tizen is ready for that. Kamil Kolasiński Tizen Isn't even ready to run your coffee maker. It's Java for Samsung products. Remember Bada OS? Samsung tried to compete, but it gave in. Unfortunately, with no-one other to compete against, (Apple is a joke. A punchline to a dad joke.) Google stopped giving a shit. Android is a shitshow and no-one wants to pick up the pieces...😑 Alex Root your phone root your phone root your phone...That's all we hear as a comeback from people...Most people don't know how to or want to know how to, they just want a fucking phone that gets updated like Apple does. For fuck sake, do you think the average Joe wants to pay a thousand plus quid and the have to root their phone to get an update that they should receive without doing all that shit....Use your fucking heads! cr08 I have to agree. I used to be a pretty avid root/rom guy but lately I just want a phone that works stock and is reliable. And if the manufacturer royally fucks up something in the rom the onus is on them to resolve it (granted they may never do anything depending on the severity of said issue). Additionally with more apps getting locked down and not being usable with a rooted phone, even more of a reason to just stick with a stock unrooted rom. I do agree however and always have that this whole dropped support immediately after launch or inside 2 years with, at best, a single major OS update is BS. I'd love to see a change on this across the board. jcopernicus I'm starting to think Google will be sold soon. This is stupid. GG Alphabet. DigitalMuser woah, easy. jcopernicus That's the motto for innovation now at google. darrsil Remember when they said the Pixel C was a focus product for them? What a joke. makapav Well... when Google's focus on anything is 1% of the industry standard...it should give you an idea of how long they'd stick and develop on something they never had any focus on in the first place. LondonLeedsFan Any ideas on Assistant making an appearance on Chromebooks? bekifft Oh ok cool so just more official confirmation that Google doesn't care about their own products and that buying a Nexus 9 was a huge mistake. Merf If you have already bought a Nexus 9 you already know that it was a huge mistake. Frankly, Google assistant isn't better than what I have already on my Nexus 9 so I find it hard to get too upset about it. Shelly-Man Vol 2 I bought the Nexus 9 almost 2 years ago, and I regret it. Derek I've had the Assistant on my Pixel C for some time now. So I'm to assume that for tablets, it's currently only exclusive to the Pixel C. codemonkey85 Hah, I don't even have Assistant yet on my LG Nexus 5 (running the latest version of Marshmallow that it supports). Nicholas Castano If anyone thought Google would do anything else but screw its userbase over, you're an idiot. imsoupercereal Yesterday Google surprise installed Assistant and tried to force me through the tutorial...while I was trying to take a timely picture. By the time I could stop it doing what I didn't ask it to, I had missed my photo opportunity. Thanks Google for pushing something I didn't ask for at a time I didn't ask for! Leonardo Baez Nexua 6P here running 7.1.2 I have not receive the assistant yet TigerMike901 Of course not....why focus on supporting millions of existing products/users when you can just put those talents to much better use, like creating more messaging apps that literally NOONE is asking for.... freaking Google!! smh Still using a Nexus 7 '13.... PVL_93_RU Google really wants to kill the tablt segment don't they Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Assistant is a nightmare. You can't disable it. It always finds way back to the system. And every time you push Home button phone asks if I want to turn Google Assistant back on. WTF, Google??? Every new update turns Android into a much worse system than before. Feeling helpless. Google screws up everything. Matt No sign of the roll out on non-pixel devices in the UK as of yet. I had it for a while with US language settings but changed it back and lost it. TFN Same. I'm not getting any sign of it even changing my language settings to US in the Google App iluvthesoftsoft 90% of the comments I read on AP talk about how tablets suck, tablets can't do anything, tablets are dead. So why do so many people care about this. Personally, I really don't see ANY benefit to having Assistant on my phone. Keep it away from my Pixel C. I'm fine with that. David Hyman boo! i wish they would support the pixel c better. Jeremy Zurek Not liking this new assistant...Want my ability to select text on my screen when in an app manually...Not have Google try and figure it out themselves.. Iamsecond Google, all twist, no stick. Deeco I can confirm that it will never reach my phone too Ron Knapik Google apps and features should be just that and should be made available to all devices including tablets. Gary Graf Not much in the way of assistance, eh? Adam Margeson Punny. :P Jack Smith Today but not tomorrow. Assistant will be on everything! That is a given as it loses value without. Roh_Mish I hate assistant. No text input? Really? You know i use my phone in public places too, google. Also I really loved the text selection option for search and copying. ddobovsek The article is incorrect. I have Samsung Note 10.1 with kitkat installed and had just updated to google assistant Kamil Kolasiński Welp, Google stopped giving a shit. Android is so fragmented, literally anyone can have a different security patch. Now, Google Play services doubles that amount. Fuckin great. My phone's last update was "April 2016" SecPatch. Either Google enforces a homogenous Android update policy, or Android will end with Android P - Polonium Poisoning.😒 Rguezlp My Mediapad M3 from Huawei already have the Google Assistant.... Yeah....

Pelosi sought responses from businesses like Comcast, Verizon, Sprint and AT&T, to see if they support the repeal of pending Obama-era privacy regulations mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in October of 2016. Pelosi worried that undoing the new rules through the Congressional Review Act would allow internet service providers (ISPs) to package and sell people’s personal browsing data to advertisers. Companies not mentioned in the the letter include Google and Facebook. Both not only make enormous amounts of money connecting ads to consumers, but also contribute financially to Pelosi. Google is expected to make $72.69 billion in ad revenues in 2017, while Facebook is estimated to make $33.76 billion, according to market research company eMarketer. The two companies combined account for 90 percent of the growth in new ad revenue. Google and Facebook donated a combined $80,875 to Pelosi through the last three campaign cycles, according to OpenSecrets.org. Some argue that the data such private companies like Google and Facebook have is way more detailed and personal than the one’s ISPs can use. “Google’s Gmail system has very good access to personal data — it sees what you’re telling your friends, business contacts, and family and it knows who your friends are,” Richard Bennett, a tech consultant and one of the original creators of the Wi-Fi system, told The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF). He added that, on the contrary, Gmail is encrypted so ISPs cannot determine what is being said and to whom. Bennett went on to say that Facebook is similar since, along with Google, they have tracking code embedded in ninety percent of the top 1,000 webs sites, meaning the two companies are able to monitor beyond their own platforms. But the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group, disagrees with Bennett’s contentions, and essentially says the opposite. “Google and Facebook don’t see all your online behavior — only the traffic you send to them. But your ISP sees everything,” a spokesperson for the EFF told TheDCNF. “ISP spying is a much harder thing to fight than app spying,” referring to Google’s Android operating system. (RELATED: Google Android Apps Are Colluding, Sharing Users’ Data Without Consent) Unlike Pelosi’s letter, the EFF says that it is still worried about Google, Facebook and other services violating people’s privacy. “Both companies (and many more) should do more to protect privacy on a daily basis. However, the answer isn’t to lower privacy protections elsewhere — it’s for all services to do the right thing.” After President Donald Trump signed the CRA repeal of the rules, Republican FCC Chairman Pai said the decision “appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet,” according to Reuters. “Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers.”. (RELATED: FCC Wants To Get Rid Of One Of The Most Annoying Things In The World)r A representative for the Center for Democracy and Technology told TheDCNF that one of the main reasons Pelosi and the vast majority of Democrats voted against the repeal was due to their “understanding that the broadband privacy rules were fulfilling the Commission’s Congressional mandate to ensure that common carriers protect the confidentiality of their customers’ information.” ISPs and cable companies often claim that the only information they want are related to preferences and tendencies for marketing purposes. Companies are forbidden by the Telecommunications Act to collect and provide data to advertisers that is “individually identifiable,” or pegged to a certain person. “We do not sell our broadband customers’ individual web browsing history. We did not do it before the FCC’s rules were adopted, and we have no plans to do so,” said Gerard Lewis, Comcast’s chief privacy officer, according to Reuters. The Internet & Television Association (NCTA), a trade association that represents broadband companies and more than 90 percent of the U.S. cable market, says the repeal of the FCC’s rules does not mean ISPs will start selling “their customers’ ‘sensitive’ information — including financial, children’s, and health information, social security numbers, and precise geolocation data — without first obtaining the affirmative opt-in consent of their customers.” As Mike Wehner writes for BGR, “Sorry, but nobody actually cares about your web browsing history.” Phil Kerpen, a free-market policy analyst and president of a conservative organization called American Commitment, disputes the notion that Democrats like Pelosi voted against the repeal because they wanted to ensure privacy protections. “Democrats have a very close relationship with Google, Amazon, and Facebook that benefit from draconian rules imposed on ISPs to keep them from entering the online advertising market,” Kerpen said, according to TheDCNF. “They also see the fake tech-left narrative about ‘selling your browser history’ — which of course is still as illegal as ever — as an opportunity to score political points.” The former CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who now serves as the executive chairman of parent company Alphabet, is not shy about his affinity for liberal causes and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (RELATED: Google Boss: Trump Admin Is Going To Do ‘Evil Things’) Schmidt was spotted wearing a “staff” badge during Clinton’s election night party. Alphabet was also reportedly spearheading the funding efforts for the legal brief signed by nearly 100 companies that objected to President Donald Trump’s temporary immigration ban. Kerpen claims that Republicans voted for the repeal of the FCC privacy order “to undo the corrupt gift given to Google.” The final point Pelosi makes in the letter appealing to ISPs and telecomm companies purports that there is a connection between this measure and reports of Russian hacking. “Americans learned last week that agents of Russian intelligence hacked into e-mail accounts to obtain secrets on American companies, government officials and more,” Pelosi writes. ” This resolution [repeal] would not only end the requirement you take reasonable measures to protect consumers’ sensitive information, but prevents the FCC from enacting a similar requirement and leaves no other agency capable of protecting consumers. Does your company support the enactment of S.J. Res. 34?” Kerpen called Pelosi’s letter “naked political grandstanding.” Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

The first generation of TPUs have targeted inference, which means they use an already trained model.  The impressive power of the TPU mentioned above comes on production AI workloads that utilize the neural network inference. What's more, the Tensor Processing Unit is quite energy efficient, delivering a 30 times to 80 times improvement in TOPS/Watt measure. A different Google thanks to TPU Google's experts explain that without the TPU, the computational expense of the deep learning models it deploys would have been tremendous and would have seriously changed the company's landscape.  ... » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Recent related news TPU Better Than GPUNearly a year ago we commented that the TPU - The Tensor Processing Unit - might be Google's big advantage in AI.

The agency found “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce”, according to Janette Wipper, a Labour Department regional director. The Department’s regional solicitor Janet Herold said the agency has “received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters”. Read more Why you need more than data to close the gender pay gap Google strongly denied the claims and criticised the Department of Labour for not revealing how it had collated its data and said it was the first time that company had heard of such accusations. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” Google said in its statement. The company took to Twitter to defend itself, insisting it had closed the wage gap between men and women across the world. Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today → https://t.co/KTuGTJMV16 pic.twitter.com/rBciSK21uF — Google (@Google) April 4, 2017 The findings come after the same Government agency sued the internet company in January, accusing the company of not handing over information on employee pay for an audit. Google said it was withheld for privacy reasons and the requirements were “too broad”. Undeterred, the Government agency asked the court on Friday to compel Google to turn over the required information to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Google marks International Women's Day with 13 amazing women 13 show all Google marks International Women's Day with 13 amazing women 1/13 Ida Wells An African-American journalist and activist born in Mississippi in 1862, she wrote prolifically on the fight for women’s suffrage as well as the struggle for civil rights. She documented the practice of lynching black people in the southern states showing how it was often used as means of controlling or punishing black people who competed with whites rather than as a means of “justice” for crimes. 2/13 Lotifa El Nadi Egypt’s first female pilot born in 1907 in Cairo. Although her father saw no need for her to pursue secondary education, expecting her to marry and have a family, she rebelled and worked as a secretary and telephone operator at a flying school in exchange for lessons as she had no other means to pay for the training. Her achievements made headlines around the world when she flew over the pyramids and competed in international flying races. 3/13 Frida Kahlo A Mexican painter and activist born in Mexico City in 1907, her work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and indigenous traditions and by feminists for its honest depiction of female experience. 4/13 Lina Bo Bardi A Brazilian architect, born in Italy in 1914, she devoted her life to the promotion of the social and cultural potential of architecture and design. She is also celebrated for her furniture and jewellery designs. 5/13 Olga Skorokhodova A Soviet scientist born into a poor Ukranian peasant family in 1911, she lost her vision and hearing at the age of five. Overcoming these difficulties in a remarkable way, she became a researcher in the field of communication and created a number of scientific works concerning the development of education of deaf-blind children. She was also a teacher, therapist and writer. 6/13 Miriam Makeba A South African singer and civil rights activist born in Johannesburg in 1932, she was forced to work as a child following her father’s death. She became a teenaged mother after a bried and allegedly abusive marriage at 17, before she was discovered as a singer of jazz and African melodies. After becoming hugely successful in the US and winning a Grammy, she became involved in the civil rights struggle stateside as well as in the campaign against apartheid in her home country, writing political songs. Upon her death, South African President Nelson Mandela said that “her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.” 7/13 Sally Ride An American astronaut and physicist, she was born in Los Angeles in 1951 and joined NASA in 1978 after gaining her PhD. She became the first American woman and the third woman ever to go into space in 1983 at the age of 32. Prior to her first space flight, she attracted attention because of her gender and at press conferences, was asked questions such as, “Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?” She later worked as an academic at the University of California, San Diego. 8/13 Halet Cambel A Turkish archaeologist born in 1916, she became the first Muslim women to compete in the Olympics in the 1936 Berlin games as a fencer. She declined an invitation to meet Adolf Hitler on political grounds, and after the conclusion of the Second World War, she trained as an architect and later worked as an academic in Turkey and Germany. 9/13 Ada Lovelace An English mathematician and writer born in 1815, she became the world’s first computer programmer. The daughter of poet George Byron, she is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, and was the first to recognise the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, creating the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. 10/13 Rukmini Devi An Indian dancer and choreographer credited with reviving Indian classical dance, she was born in 1904 and presented her form of dance on stage even though it was considered “low” and “vulgar” in the 1920s. She features in India Today’s list of “100 people who shaped India” having also worked to re-establish traditional Indian arts and crafts and as an animal rights activist. 11/13 Cecilia Grierson An Argentine physician, reformer born in Buenes Aires in 1859, she became the first woman in Argentina to receive a medical degree having previously worked as a teacher. Women were barred from entering medical school at the time, so she first volunteered as an unpaid lab assistant before she was allowed to train as a doctor. She was acclaimed for her work during a cholera epidemic before going on to found the first nursing school in Argentina. The harassment she experienced at mediacl school helped make her a militant advocate for women’s rights in Argentina. 12/13 Lee Tai-young Korea’s first female lawyer and judge born in 1914 in what is now North Korea, she was also an activist who founded the country’s first legal aid centre and fought for women’s rights throughout her career. Her often mentioned refrain was, “No society can or will prosper without the cooperation of women.” She worked as a teacher, married and had four children before she was able to begin her legal career after the Second World War, becoming the first woman to enter Seoul National University. She also fought for civil rights in the country and was arrested in 1977 for her beliefs, receiving a three-year suspended sentence and a ten year disbarment. 13/13 Suzanne Lenglen A French tennis champion born in 1899, she popularised the sport winning 31 championships and dominating the women’s sport for over a decade. She was the first female tennis celebrity and one of the first international women sports stars, overcoming a childhood plagued with ill health including chronic asthma – which continued to plague her in her adult life. At 15, she became the youngest ever winner of a major championship and lost only seven matches during her entire career. She received widespread criticism for her decision to turn professional, but defended her right to make a decent living in the days when the grand slam tournaments paid a relative pittance to the winners. The OFCCP works with companies that do more than $10,000 worth of business with the government per year, and prohibits “discriminating in employment decisions on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.” Read more Five reasons women do not get the same job opportunities as men Happy ‘Equal Pay Day,’ as Donald Trump rolls back Obama’s protections Gillian Anderson speaks out about equal pay and her book The OFCCP has argued that handing over the information does not interrupt Google’s business, and is encouraging the kind of inquiry into gender diversity that the company has spoken about itself and in which it has invested $150 million. Of Google’s 70,000 workers, nearly one third of them are women. Only 19 per cent of its tech jobs are carried out by women. The Labour Department’s wider probe into a lack of gender equality in Silicon Valley resulted in a lawsuit against Oracle earlier this year, which claimed that white male workers earn more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable work.

Kim Jin-a/AP hide caption toggle caption Kim Jin-a/AP The Department of Labor is suing Google to obtain payroll data to determine whether the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. Google's lawyer has called the lawsuit a "fishing expedition." Kim Jin-a/AP Just three days after Google announced that it had "closed the gender pay gap globally" on Equal Pay Day, a Department of Labor official testified in federal court that there is "systemic" discrimination against women at Google. Silicon Valley has often come under fire in recent years for being unfriendly to women, with sexual harassment allegations and lawsuits over gender bias. But a DoL official told The Guardian Friday that Google's discrimination was "extreme," even for the industry. The government is suing Google, a government contractor, to release compensation data in order to make sure the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. In a press release about the lawsuit, the DoL said that Google has had "many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily," but has "refused to do so." Google, for its part, has denied that the company has a gender discrimination problem, and called the DoL's request a "fishing expedition." Harin Contractor was an economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor under President Obama, and he says the pay gap is complicated. There are a number of factors that contribute, including women taking time out of the workforce for maternity leave, or to care for aging parents or other relatives. But there is a portion of the pay gap that can't be accounted for by these situations. "These companies need to try a little harder to encourage diversity," Contractor says, adding that often in the tech industry the people making hiring and promotion decisions are white men. "Sometimes they can get caught up in their bubble and feel like they're very open," he says. "But when it's always the same type of person making the decisions. ... maybe it's not conscious." For the past several years, Google has released its diversity data publicly in an annual report, that has shown a persistent dearth of women and minorities at the top. Last year, women represented just 31 percent of Google's workforce, and held just 24 percent of leadership roles.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch.

Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images Death and dying Opinion Why Silicon Valley wants to thwart the grim reaper John Naughton Google’s billion-dollar belief that it can crack the DNA code to immortality reveals a dangerous mindset Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Sunday 9 April 2017 02.00 EDT ‘In this world,” wrote Benjamin Franklin, “nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” This proposition doesn’t cut much ice in Silicon Valley, where they take a poor view of paying taxes. What’s interesting is that they are also coming to the view that perhaps death is optional too, at least for the very rich. You think I jest? Well, meet Bill Maris, the founder and former CEO of Google Ventures, the investment arm of Alphabet, Google’s owners. Three years ago, Maris decided to create a company that will “solve” death. He pitched the idea to Google’s co-founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page and, according to a lovely piece by Tad Friend in the New Yorker, Brin, who has a gene variant that predisposes him to Parkinson’s disease, loved the idea and Page declared that Google should do it. Live forever: Scientists say they’ll extend life ‘well beyond 120’ Read more Thus was born Calico, which is short for the California Life Company, in 2013. It started with a billion dollars in the bank and is “extremely secretive”. “All that’s known,” Friend writes, “is that it’s tracking 1,000 mice from birth to death to try to determine ‘biomarkers’ of ageing – biochemical substances whose levels predict morbidity; that it has a colony of naked mole rats, which live for 30 years and are amazingly ugly; and that it has invested in drugs that may prove helpful with diabetes and Alzheimer’s.” Calico is a typical product of the reality distortion field that is Silicon Valley. It’s a salutary illustration of how sudden and unimaginable wealth can warp minds. There are people in Palo Alto, Mountain View and Cupertino who truly believe they are living in the Florence of Renaissance 2.0. Their religion is what Neil Postman called Technopoly and their prevailing mindset is what the technology critic Evgeny Morozov describes as “solutionism”, the belief that all problems have technological solutions. It turns out that death is now perceived as just such a “problem”. Friend quotes a hedge-fund manager waxing lyrical on this. “I have the idea,” he burbles, “that ageing is plastic, that it’s encoded. If something is encoded, you can crack the code. If you can crack the code, you can hack the code!” Cue loud applause from the elite audience gathered in a Californian drawing room to discuss the secrets of longevity. That’s not to say that longevity isn’t important or relevant. In most societies, people are living longer and that’s now giving rise to acute social, psychological and economic stress. Just ask anyone who works in the NHS. Dementia and Parkinson’s disease are laying waste to an increasing number of human minds, while heart disease, cancer and diabetes are making our bodies progressively enfeebled. We live longer but our closing years can be miserable, lonely and largely pointless. To computer folk, DNA is just code, and code can always be hacked. Bingo! – immortality beckons So it’s worth pouring resources into understanding and eventually curing these diseases. But the point of that is not to abolish death but to make the natural process of ageing more tolerable towards the end. And that’s what the majority of scientists and doctors are trying to achieve. They want us to have healthier lives and “compressed morbidity”, which is a polite term for a quick and painless death at the end. The Silicon Valley crowd want something else, though: they seek to make death optional. And they think it can be done. After all, as some wag put it decades ago: “Death is nature’s way of telling you you’re fired.” Once we have mated and brought up some children, evolution regards us as disposable, past our sell-by date. So it has arranged that somewhere in our DNA are genes that will progressively trigger ageing processes, eventually causing our bodies to fail. To computer people, DNA is just code and code can always be hacked. So all we have to do is find the offending genes, edit them using Crispr and – bingo! – immortality beckons. You have to marvel at the one-dimensionality of minds that can think like this. Apart from anything else, death is what gives meaning to life. It’s also the process that ensures human vitality: young people arrive with ideas that their elders never had and death makes room for them to grow, thrive and die in their turn. That’s why elite US universities, which do not have a retirement age for tenured professors, are increasingly desperate to find ways to incentivise them to quit. Given that Silicon Valley billionaires are smart, they must know all this. So could it be that what underpins this strange new obsession with ensuring immortality is something more straightforward? Could it be that they all became wealthy at such a young age? So they have these unimaginable riches and have suddenly realised that they don’t have an infinite time to enjoy them. One’s heart bleeds for the poor lambs. Not.

You can revisit old haunts and take a virtual walk at street level. There's also lots of amusement to be had planning a route and making a rude shape with it. Until recently, users could also suggest edits and make revisions on the map database. But that's now changed. This had allowed maps to be updated with valuable local knowledge as building or construction changes were made. This particular functionality has been in place since 2008 and meant maps were kept fresh and up-to-date by people in the know. The Google Maps app is seen on an Apple iPhone 4S (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Sadly, because the edit function was open to all users, it meant that it got abused meaning all suggestions had to be moderated. Given the sheer volume of suggestions, the task of moderating each one was enormous, and proved to be too large. Google released a statement explaining their decision: "Since 2008, the Google Map Make community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience.

The conversation moves to the Celtics and who they might take in the draft. They finish over the hour recapping the 2017 Masters. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. These seasonal market and decent show and strive very. The ball game is over there right side not the 500 is they'd lose to the tigers the finals Detroit forward crossed the one. There's no other option right now because of so many injuries and it's so much sickness and man oh whatever is going now with the ballclub right now no to finally get right back and get a list of books certainly not a 100% yet. So like we can go home and quit. Against Renner there you know get a job doing now. You were traded just can't do it just to dealings with strong opinions and a handful of brain cells what's up big daddy. It is yes good drive didn't show it in good hands mark has his opinion but he's got a ball. Other things got. She's just going swimmingly ET I NG shopping jobs doesn't have the market is back up that is back I don't see him up there anyway the but I was wrong now it's time for the market increase in show our sports Radio One 03 point seven WEEI. I welcome into the mark and Jason show. Good to be back today and how about this new studio to talk about the new studio last week and I couldn't help but not a okay this studio. I'd give anything to Yates because you do I want it eaten off this cable directly like. Is so clean and perfect it is nice. I'm black I was some baby leave for one week vacation. Not exactly did not doing diaper changes but it's good to be back we have a lot to get to today. Bruins Celtics Red Sox obviously we'll toxin patriots I know you have a feeling to about Brad marsh and you do that at all yesterday we had Scott can he can get we did and we'll talk about that a little bit I have something to say about. But there's a lot to get to and I wanna just give an opening take. We. Of an optimist dom but I've been an optimistic guy in terms of the Bruins despite my. My you know doubts about two grass I've been optimistic thinking that hey I think that they can do something in the playoffs when the time arrives. Am feeling a little different and I just got out as it came down the stretch we see a little bit more out of them against especially lots of what was and we did not. Seattle game was frustrating because you lost crude in that game we don't know how long that he's going to be out and he really is honestly. The way that they play now how they get the puck out of their loans on with the defendant one of their defensemen usually crew skating out of that. He's really good at that first pass to get out of their opponent and now that they don't have him that puck carrier that puck moving defenseman. That's going to be a big problem for them and we don't know how long Carlos can doubt that they are scholarly but yesterday. Looks like to a concussion from all indications of how he was. Struggling to get upn and kind of woozy when he was when he was walk him when he was getting help back to the bench so now you're down two defenseman. In this this leads me to kind of my question that I hope they don't do I hope they don't. Activate back or because in all likelihood of west Toronto loses today you're going to be playing Washington in the first round. Hey I don't think it's right to throw the kid in there in a playoff game against the number one seed in the east that you are going to lose do. I don't see them beating them because yesterday and beat that backup goaltender. Washington did play most of its players but yet the back of goaltender yet OP. With the with the Bruins had an an immense difficulty he owns yeah operates yeah Boston roots up he did what he does what are the broad genes that the Celtics. This week Brady told me. Eleven Joseph. Against the Bruins 945 save percentage one point eight goals against three shots to grass meanwhile against the capitals in one in 98087. Save percentage. Threw for four goals against. This series won't be series if they end up playing Washington now is why I don't understand. And this stuff you know what drives me crazy but I do not understand why Bruce Cassidy did not try to. Do everything that they could to beat Washington and to avoid Washington. I don't wanna see Washington labors are they played your goalie. They played goalie listen. I've already admitted that I was wrong about that I know down the stretch Google Rask was the right decision distort we got so many ways the goalie I don't you know I. I can't win here with the goal is. He is is what I wonder about this a couple questions recommend this when you talk about the decision yesterday to play you'd open. Let's by the way does he didn't feel well right unbelievable. While I mean look I'm not dragged out of that we use is a questions that that should be asked if about that situation yesterday eight was it the was it a situation where the Bruins are managing to cook is we've heard that all you are in this so. Did you Google up to them and say no I want to play and if they said no if they told them now. Then that's on them. And if Rask in bothered to be bothered by it. Then you've asked that it would bother to be bothered by if you wasn't frustrated by the fact that they were playing him instead of Udoh Brin and he's. Not complicit with that. But OK with the decision he's just kind of like okay is one on one of my days that they gonna management. Then he probably that probably that's our great lucky there on his part celebrated. Either way it doesn't look good yeah you know either way it doesn't look good because I you know I just don't get it that you're not playing until either Wednesday or Thursday. It out and looks like they're going to be playing on Wednesday are excuse me on Thursday with against Washington. I'm because sadly the Celtics are home Wednesday in the last game. So I just I don't get it you you you wanted the too big even as ugly as those games are against dot org you would think that. You'd have a better chance definitely 100 million in a series against them over washing 100 gave no chance against Washington not a hero Don. No not at all and book again let's go back to the marsh on suspension because. It you know just because you don't like what he did. Against a deadly game against Tampa Bay. On Tuesday it does it mean that you don't appreciate waited for the rest of the season what were your thoughts on the suspension and what he deserved it 100% deserve to and it's a completely on him. It was a selfish move. And he didn't seem to remorseful laughter in the only thing that he said was. Well you know I I feel like. I feel like god the only place people that mattered to me of the players. On the ice my teammates and my family. And you know if you ever played hockey you don't understand what's gore okay well we do because there's cameras everywhere Brad we understand that there's a little bit of a cross checked by adoption. Which was a light tap to say Elise it was just a minimal minimal love apt. That every defense he gives a guy that's in front of the net that sound off what is and you. And you know two to sit there and and try and defend what you did it just it blows my mind I I. I don't I don't buy. That yes has the play that way. That sort of stuff cat that's sort of stuff he doesn't have to do to be woody is because a by the way the people let's say that I guess they forget that when he was at. Before he got drafted by the Bruins in the third round in the third round it's a pretty important tech. You expect those players to contribute. You would play for the Canadian junior team by the white. So this guy's not subscribe they just made his name. Made his name by. By you know being of Pratt and being dirty in doing stupid stuff from being an agitator. Is a difference between being an agitator on the ice into what he did. Against Tampa let me ask your question do you think that at all in this situation. There was some bad luck involved. I mini game a little jab not how stupid that was I was about you know he's gonna hit him in the not yes he did it definitely without saying we just knew he was gonna mail write cannot with. How question that he's Canadian there's not a fan is now that there's no edit. You know he was just trying to get a little note that in a little message quick one get him into help get him in the in our guest star maker decided they know what you know when you see the replays. From the point where there's a snapshot taken by defenseman and they score from the point because the traffic of run and that you see the replay. And you see the composite stick bend a little yeah a lot. Well when Marchand hit him in the junk. Dubbed the state banks so there was no. Accidental swing there was no. I didn't mean to hitch their body now that was purposeful. He was pit stop dating get it a cross check penalty called Biden called on Dotson. A couple seconds before it happened was just don't I agree so there's just dull the conclusion is that he got emotional lost his cool and herta Steve. Which is on except the up and not acceptable and they've lost him now for the last two games they lost in the last giant dam could use them against that Ottawa you tell me how to think they would have been able to capitalize on some of their chances. In that game that they had against Ottawa out and maybe they wouldn't even have to have worried about not worried but you would have been able to do whatever you needed to do in the last game of the season against the capitals. Listen you know I just it's frustrating because you know the people that say well he's gonna continue to play that way that's who we as well you know what they'd get ready for life without Brad Marchand for for a majority of time do you Gloria is no exit. Okay that's right. You know what that's specialists isn't going away his reputation as a gonna go away. What he did isn't going away. And he's gonna get suspended for more games. In he's got to continue to get suspended so the people let's say well that's sorting is gonna continue to play that way are well they get ready for life put up Marchand for a significant amount of time because. He's gonna keep getting suspended is not get the all the sudden I don't wake up and feel bad form and be like OK I'll Brad birdied your break this time now. Carrie we'll talk to Jamie Murphy covers the Bruins at 1020 we'll get his take. On marsh and then the rest of the Bruins situation is or is the playoffs go on listen. I don't know if so Tai Anderson they've really got our comp. He seems he seems to agree with me or I agree with him Harvey wanna put it that they would have a better chance against Ottawa. However I will say 0144. Games that's pretty good sample size they gonna win any game now jar somewhere close that. You know I don't like either match up. I U I from everything I've gathered at the big advantage Ottawa hagee is their coaching and that's why all. So yeah I'd rather see them not understood why winning goal Wally and as far as Bruce Cassidy goes why he mingle all in to try to beat Washington to avoid playing. I don't. Now there's not much to get about it it doesn't make a lot of sense I mean the Ottawa game was what laws you know they are. But they were that they were without Marchand and they lost group that was a uphill battle that they had you. Had to fight the entire game this seems it try to get back into that game and you know there. Again you could use Marchand and I came out did you use him in the shootout and set to have amber Trotter or excuse me sort out there which is big he can be used in there where he's pretty damn good. Yeah I you know I don't like where this is going because. You know I'm just thinking here over the course the last few weeks especially since the match ups have come into play a little bit where we know they're gonna face either Ottawa or Washington I'm getting less and less confident not that I had a ton of confidence in the Bruins before that not getting less and less confident. And unfortunately unfortunately. Are starting to feel that way regarding the Boston Celtics I don't know why maybe it was the cavs game maybe it's just. Say you were right today I was just you were right it's easy to say. Why wait a minute what what you're right about what I've been saying this all year about this team that they are not alone I'm not I. I am one of the few people that have been I said that from the very beginning of the season now I'm not convinced they're getting out of the first round I they should. They show it dear I'm not convinced that it. I'm not convinced of that I'm sorry. Before we get into that. Full throttle let me ask you this if they don't get out of the first round and what kind of scenario does that present. Well I think it a restarting those right on about my wallet already talking about not I don't think yet with Steve O Jack I don't think that was Stevens but I think a roster shake up jerked the roster should be on the writing assured the writing should be on the wall about Isiah. Was that I welcome I think he's a good player but I think there's a very very very small window that you're dealing with a view if you resign him. And in I don't know that's the direction that the team once ago why didn't they why did they add pieces at the trade deadline if they felt that Thomas was one of those guys dig to build around. You know for all the talk about how much they've problem and how much they love this team and a score. There's some decisions that have to be made within have to be made in the off season with this team that are pretty significant ones. Avery Bradley's gonna be up after next year mark Smart can be up that's next year. There's his decisions that have to be made on some pretty significant players on this roster that may or may not be here. When this team is actually contending for a championship which is the way I felt about it for a long time and I understand it's a long approach and people don't wanna hear that. But sometimes that's also the approach that you need to take because that's the safest way of acquiring a superstar. People that think that they again Paul George up I just don't believe that I think these guys off to highlight his agent is set so glad that he wants to play that and it doesn't. That doesn't set in the it's it's not set in stone that he's gonna deal Laker but it it's up ahead. And you know what else that. Present today thought that I had a few weeks ago or last week forget when but. Com you know we were talking a little bit I think the last time I was in about the draft and who we want the Celtics take your more of mark helpful skied and one's a ball that I want Alonso ball however I did remember. What his father said and yes the Celtics could draft him and he could play impossible but who's to say the first chance he gets to go to the lakers he would ring gall. Yeah I don't know if I'd wanna dance with him now you know that's another thing to take into consideration I don't know what that we're I want to Iowa were more I would worry about the idea you boy player you draft a manual if you like him a job in my particularly not a huge fan of his game I think is a little bit overrated I don't think he's a particularly. Good shooter. I don't think he does a lot of things well. That when well did things that he does well I don't necessarily think that they're gonna translate. To the to the NBA he's a great passer but what is esteem need it's delicious say if they made the decision that Isiah is not to be part of the future. The agony is score. Ball is far from that he's a good players great facilitator is a great passer but he's not he's score a little bit a little yeah apps only ten. But I'll just share of faults is the more well rounded player. There's a lot more of his game that I like that I think can translate any six sport he's not tiny easily you know he's not diminutive you know a story about that. Two ways weighs 64 pretty pretty big guy to play the point are positioning he's really more of like that hybrid guard its commitment to leaflets or other well like Westbrook no way. Like west Westbrook who can do at all is more for shooting guard replace the point he's a great. Great passer. Fultz is a good passer I don't know if I outweigh. Balls passing ability you know if they get fortunate and get that pick over somebody who has some much more complete game to mark Al faults if the Celtics. Started the playoffs right now may be that you see that they would face the pacers who looks like it mom. Obviously that would be an unacceptable series loss was a fun. I'm not crazy about the match up just for example George but. They should be that I should be about forty and forty they should be that is that that would be unacceptable they lose to vote to vote. Pictures of all he did this year this is a better mess Alia be so they can't lose that then you would face most likely either Toronto or Washington if they stayed in QC com. And then they could lose one of those series you'd avoid Washington at things shook shook out the way they share if everybody one that was at the top foresees one. Toronto will play Cleveland in Washington were played the Celtics I think that's what both Boston and Cleveland. I don't know of Cleveland who want that. Know probably so because Washington seems to be a bad matchup for them or at least they haven't played well against Washington this year but how's that again we saw. What happened this week when the Celtics kind of dished. Pulled their drug out and put it on your forehead and said you really figure out our level. You're not on a level. And it was really in there was really. If it it was encapsulated in about one minute a basketball where LeBron James went down the lane. And dunked over the entire Celtics team and then sprinted the other end of the floor and swatted markets smarts layup attempt. With two hands went into the stands it was that being with all of the Celtics fans in in the stance. That that was kind of encapsulated right there wasn't great sequence that was not a good look for the Celtics at all. So we'll see if you know for a minute there everybody get excited that they were vying for the ones he wouldn't really make any they're gonna do you mood they're gonna contend with yeah Cleveland. It's just a long series and nom you know LeBron James made those comments earlier in the week. And nobody wanted to hear him talk like that it was kind of unbecoming of him but is due chic I agree with everything set and this man has been to the finals for. Six straight years or whatever it's bad. These games. Just don't matter and they matter to teams like the Celtics but to hit and you know what he did he say you know what are 55. Everyone. I'll I'll you know embrace this game. And I will be coming gates and he did and look what happened yet you know they and he said okay we wanna make it a game day. They these games mean something when they want them to mean something when that team wanted that went like they said okay Celtics are making a big deal out of it we're going to just go out there and do we do we're gonna player get more or show home. Well playoff basketball is going to be all about if date basis in the conference finals. I'm not even sure that this Celtics and again this is developing opinion but I'm ready meat should this Celtics team is better than that 0102 team the one that loss of the nets in the Eastern Conference finals. There's Antoine Walker knew it and maybe not because view up Paul Pierce and Amare did write a month and although others said they were better I don't known now. Not that it really that he I'm just thinking about team wasn't there it it was Pearson it was walker and it was nobody else. It was a great roster not related to Walter McCarty yeah but it would it was a great roster but having Paul Pierce there I mean. Real quick before we go to break Russell Westbrook MVP. Did it shouldn't even be questioned it shouldn't when it really shouldn't be MB. One of two players in NBA history to do that and I think there was an article that was written by as Kennedy was Chris Forsberg or somebody wrote wrote about Westbrook and I'll find the article I actually printed it in. He. He he accomplished this in ten less minutes per game then Oscar Robertson that. So you know eight in a lot of is a lot of issuable bubbles were done by. The fourth quarter there was like four from that were done by halftime so he had completed the feat of getting a triple double within the course of the game. Early on in these games so wasn't something that was hanging over the team or something that the team may have been not focusing on the trying to get endure. To that triple double yeah in the fourth quarter and the real thing about it's in our in the fourth quarter way more efficient. Way more efficient. And his production is off the charts compared James Harden and I know they don't have the best team but did the six seat currently in a difficult Western Conference he has in the playoffs without without him they're not there at the top of the lottery or near or not maybe not top water but the certainly not a death let us know what to their in the lottery and he hasn't in the playoffs right now. That combined with the triple double record forget it I Jim Hardy in nice player James. Now I'm not going there and Russell Westbrook is the MVP are we get accurate market Jason shell. I've another Celtics dot plus we're gonna talk about a few other things leading up to Jayme Murphy and twenty when it's a masters partners well this the mark and Jason show one of two point seven WER. When a playoff series and we'll talk until I wanna do when a playoff series and so. I'm stuck I'm stuck in the way of sticking with that I I don't think they're any better in Washington Toronto. And they do have a rebound weakness that we known for you know jump street that hasn't been rectified. Sells a lot like Gil. Bob Bryan Smart guy and her comment there on the bus rarely great hall of fame writer very bright individual act agrees you're here's. What I think the Celtics are kept. You remember in college you'd go to a party sometimes or did you show up toward disaster because show but party in this guy brings this really smoking hot girl. And the girls at the party and throughout the party she's kind of doing her wrong thing the guys doing his staying stuck in his buddies she's talking to people she's talking to this one guy this one guy won't stop talking indoor you know she's engaging him he's having a good time he's overzealous he's excited she stock enemy attack. But at the end of the night. You know we should go on and not back that that guy the overzealous exciting guy that's the Celtics that it's nice to girls talking to him during the party. But at the end of the night gives him a little bit of any goes right in the next I feel good about yourself even an exciting goes out and fines for you know meets ago bar because he's a little bit more confident from talk of rigor it demanded that I you know. Who she's going homeless and it's not you know. The cavs are taking the girl home and I think that's kind of what was on display last week. Especially that we should after all the build up and LeBron making those comments kind of re engaging himself in the rivalry air quotes. And they went out to get to the Celtics and I think that's what we'll see in a class Jewish we're gonna get to the red sex here in just a minute give thought to wrap up the Celtics. Oh. My favorite my favorite thing about the Celtics the way Al Horford is playing. There's really really well here we go really good basketball for 3030 million dollars by the late great basketball. 80211 games that you say like. Pipe dreams of all played street at the Celtics make it to the conference finals right they play they play the cavaliers while. In eleven games vs Cleveland out or for its teens are all in the let it. All in eleven. And Al Horford the Max contract thirty million dollar player does all the great things I you don't if you don't you don't understand basketball if you don't she how goody is what he can watch out what he does story on the fourth value sets screens like you read about the unbelievable I do the same screen it's like art it's like watching Picasso on before when the guys at the screen it's amazing yeah ten and a half points a game. Four point four rebounds per game and 2.3 assists per game shooting 51% from four only took a hundred shots averaging about eleven shots attend eleven shots a game. Or excuse me a little bit under ten shots a game and it's my favorite one he is a minus. 139. When he is on the floor vs the cavaliers. They got that's right close Izzy dizzy refinements there's I did it myself it's called research mark catcher tries its antibody. It's I mean it just kind of hammers home the point to me what that guy is an end this delusional thought. Of what type of play you were getting a Max money. I never said that the guy's not a good player I think he is and I understand what he does well on the floor and how he spaces the floor for Isaiah. But he's not particularly athletic yep he's thirty years old he is not a great defenders not a terrible defender not a great defender. He's shooting from outside is fine OK he's not a good rebounder. There is a lot of things about him that. Are negative in the sense that I'm not paying that guy thirty million dollars in sorry I'm not there is no higher level than a Max contract player and that's what you get that's at that the money he got. And he's just not that type of player. 417371287. Is the phone number give his collar texted 37937. You said it's the pipe dream of ultimate pipe dreams are something you did I I wouldn't go that far those being you know oh is overstating handled yeah just to get to I mean if you wanna talk about winning the championship we could say it happened. Just getting to the Eastern Conference finals. When I go that far. I'm okay. So I'm going to switch gears real quick as the Boston Red Sox started their season they were to an all too good games at Fenway Park then they go on the road. And the thing that a lot of us were worried about. The open and I proved a lot of people right within the way the bullpen performed especially in that third game first game in Detroit on Friday. You know I'm not gonna panic it's not time to do anything like that obviously but. This is the Boston Red Sox right now we were worried about the bullpen and now the bullpen in a situation where they need to come through couldn't that's you know if it looks like a duck and quacks like a dot. Guess what. And that was situation gathered that Darian there really struggling with. Not having not haven't spent there and I haven't or break okay it's not like they're like hi I think it Thornburgh reserve it would help a little bit but that still be a lot of moving pieces going around in the bullpen I want you to explain to me I keep hearing about while they're not analysts admit they don't have Thornburgh. How good are these guys I mean are these guys really is that it amazing Smith Harrison Smith Smith was a very very top of. He was the top of that probably type of bullpen guy when he was healthy okay Seattle are biased in it's out but he was he was really really good his yeah I hope your right. I ice keeps see hear about these guys Smith Barney in the you haven't seen him yet account yeah haven't seen him yet our and he certainly need to help right now they have a AAA bullpen in the getting Tripoli results yeah yep and you know their day don't have an eighth inning guy because hitting middle relief that you sets seven dating guys questionable we're you gonna bring in it's going to be in certain situations and back and fortune edged. The way it's going to be and this is something that Dombrowski is had a track record of I mean the reason. The overriding thought in Detroit is why that team who was super talented in the rotation. In their lineup was it was unbelievable why they couldn't win a World Series is because they're ball it was awful. The open was terrible that was built by Dombrowski and he has a track record. Of not being able to put together a bullpen in that can cost teams championships in critical moments is you need your bullpen to step up. And they bend they've been terrible you know the one guy that you can look at and say OK maybe this guy's carved out a role from self when everybody's healthy is patella. He's a pretty good for them so far. He's been pretty but that's about it yeah Joseph Kelly can't find strikes on every time the guy throws a fastball gets wallop or he walks guys. Agreed to tell it to get runners and Keith Embry. Okay he's okay but he has his control issues you know who else do you turn to. Robbie Scott. Really young guy I mean in and that was one of the problems I had nineteen Friday well you know that if Detroit's gonna bring up if there's a lefty coming up to the plate that. Detroit in your gonna bring out Robbie Scott the face and you know Detroit's gonna count or bring upper right so what did you sleep every and they are the face a guy because every has better stuff the Robby Scott. But he's got a soft toss starring lefty specialist. That. Is lucky to get a guy out lucky. He's not a great reliever now you know I like the guy with the stuff over the guy. Over over the over the lefty specialist because you're lefty specialist is that good you know it's even more frustrating about this whole situation I don't think there's anything that I can't stand more than. Sox bullpen talk. And I just think Eric. But the bullpen is bad you have to address sin. The bullpen you know the just as a really light my fire often but what I mean look you don't mean it doesn't get it like it's just. The bullpen you can talk about sexy pitchers back there and flatter than like talking a bottom get used to it I don't it's a long season my friend long season but. You know you can talk about the offense. Bogart's not be in there again that's not be there again yeah and Haley not being there while the float. So we've all had the flu Dave O'Brien left the game yesterday with a glorious feeling ill and that's too bad you don't like to see that these guys are sick. Hanley. Even make the trip Detroit needing to make the trip bu Q was feeling ill. I don't know he was available to pit. It's just unbelievable I mean they've had an unbelievable spring in terms of health right I mean this team. Pretty banged up pretty unhealthy. Considering they were. Training and usually doesn't get better as the season goes on all easily there tomorrow more more guys that are gonna suffer injuries. Throughout the course of the seas I am glad though. I was not with you when Chris Sale pitch the other Nikes he was good he was good and I do not want to see whatever you were doing by yourself at home wife and we know how much you love him you probably sweating. You know some tissue and heavy padding he had this that I didn't not interested in now but he did pitch very well he's awesome ya and I'm really like he was electric yeah I mean you watch him pitch in. And end. You see why the excitement level is there for a guy like that. And in the U you hope that it's got to stabilize. Stabilize your rotation for at least the time being and maybe maybe. Kinda get a little bit of a competition going you thought it lottery does he look good for the first cup few innings and then he exploded on Saturday. You know couldn't find the sharks are out just had a bad ending in the fifth inning when it wasn't able to make it out that through. Through you know 41%. Of his eighty pitches were were were strikes that's that's that's pretty terrible had trouble finding strikes on the whole game but. The one shining the one not shining light put the one. The one nice thing about the season so far was set up. Gossip as advertised fantastic. Was a fishing that's big and in the guy pitches so. That I expect that pay that pace of that game was you know had they been able to win that came in in nine innings that was gonna be on pace like a two and a half hour game. And he's not dealing with the flu which is nice when she pitch again. He is young he's going to be picked on guy and he's going to be pitching mound tomorrow because Parcells on right. Okay so we did see him again com. And yeah reports cell was what I needed him to be. Efficient. Good you it would it would eat you after it was that you an arm he wasn't great he was okay here's our he wasn't getting a lot of run support early in the game they had away it was until the fifth inning when the Red Sox were able to he was going toe to toe there. For most of the game so that's good to seek is it taking get that out of him and sale a sale. They'll be in a good spot yep you know just get over this flu get this flu lot of my face because I you know you don't have time for this kind of thing Baltimore looks good in the Yankees. They have been disappointing. Yet while they they're going to be I mean they're going to be an up and our team until they figure out what the rotations going to be like in their offense is gonna struggle at times because. It's an extremely young team and until you get some. Some stability in the lineup in the rotation I think that's what's that's what they're going to be. I mean once once Hanley and Bogart's and vets are all back then you can. You know watch a team fur for a week or so orange is starts have a feel for what the offense is going to be capable adorned. Because right now the only. Really reliable that's that you're having here in the in your lineup are bent and the US gotten off to a great start he had that home run in the first game which fantastic. In Saint Paul Sandoval had a good start to the year you know which is nice is she's well yes. It's big opposite field homer on three run home run on Friday thing was to give the Red Sox lead that they couldn't hold on to take one thing that drives me nuts. This whole thing about Craig Kimbrel. And not being able to pitch in anything but he save a clean inning safe situation. Is so soft it is wet toilet paper. I cannot stand it. It drives me crazy. John Farrell saying after the game ball you know it's not who will eventually it may be in a situation where it's not a savory as you get more than three outs but not in game three. The fact that this guy needs so much time to figure out a way to deal with those situations and he's useless in them. Is so disgusting and so mentally weak in my mind I can't stand it hate it. Yeah he's Andy but you know Ben go look at his numbers in the eighth inning when he's had. Hard not save situations and he's not good now. Not good at all and there's no reason for denying it's correct so light that at some point you're going to need you're gonna need you're gonna need your closer to be able to give you more than three outs is just gonna happen the threat and if you can't lie especially when your middle relief. Los. You might need that closer to come in their now it's early. But I just don't like how we sit well you know we're gonna work we're gonna wipe his ass harder and then we'll eventually will will get to the Puerto Rico white pumps off. I now. Why can he be prepared to do that I I just hate the whole situation and I think that you know honestly. Outside of like guys like Marriott Mariano Rivera. And there there a lot of a lot of closers have that and that issue whatever whatever it is it's got to be some sort of mental block. When there is nothing in you know that Karrie is in dangling robbers shot and now that issue and they won the World Series while he's different. I'm saying guys like humor different there are you know he's a different breed. Erica you know I I I and I we go I want whatsoever I throws hard Kimble look I we're all part he's got a close I would put him in his category. He's just a very he's a higher level closer than then I think Craig Kimbrel composing good close habit is not eased out of level overall the Chapman. I would have put him in that category there is something. Is it is a mental thing with these guys were they can't seem to be able to figure out that Obama on the game's tied we still needs to pitch well. And it it's especially bad with Campbell it was awful last year. In non save situation is terrible. And you know if you can't rely on him for that. At certain points of the season and that's going to be a problem you your eighth inning guy who ever the hell it's going to be but to be lights out. If you can't rely on him in the eighth inning of game relying Campbell the common answer. Situations and a bit attendee three for fifteen or homer and three RBIs follow cent of all three for twelve homer and four RBIs. I mean a home run is nice each had three run home runs those are big hits arm. So yeah I'm optimistic about those guys is a big X factors coming into the season. And they really could use their back considering Ortiz isn't there and when you have some bullpen issues you you need guys to step up and those guys. Three for fifteen isn't great but let's give him a little time. Big home run up side I'll take. Yeah and didn't and I honestly think that he's better than I think people thought he was going to be coming out. Is that a lot of people said he was a plus plus average hitter and a guy with a little bit of power he may have more power then people originally gave him credit for. To whatever offseason. Program that he went to in the to get a little bit bigger and added forty pounds of muscle you can tell Arianna you got a little bit bigger. So you know that shouldn't you said he said it shouldn't affect his swing at all. That the balls are just gonna fly further than it did last year which is great I love the attitude I think he needs somebody like that baseball. No you don't have enough of those you know those hockey at its price hopper and who else in baseball in its ice hockey. A is pretty docket real yeah. Good fine yeah he needed he needs it has no slack good little felt a little bit attitude for the steam correct you know because I don't think you have that I think that's a boat writes nice kids great players. Great players that they don't have like. That personality that Ortiz that. That kind of Drury incident team. A case of the Red Sox are trying to figure out a way to get off this year neither on little two game losing streak. But they do give the ball to report sell both Cy Young winner last year so. A very dismissive and not enough he's EU will see if he can keep it going tiger he won the Cy Young good first start with sleeping keep it going. That's what you have these pitchers for. When you're losing two games in a row when things aren't going well you put. I on the mound and he turns it around so he had him yet sale. And should be of that Colorado X games with those guys those guys pitching absolutely are we get back you're in the market Jason show. More from the Red Sox and I have a thought on the patriots that I wanna get to some rumors regarding the patriots Robert how ski a few things there. 417371287. Is the phone number this is the mark in Jason she'll. Jason show on sports Radio One 03 point seven WEEI. Looks remarked on Twitter at mark dent aero. Follow Jason on Twitter at G terra bella WEEI. I welcome back to mark and Jason Joseph you know it's frustrating and maybe this symptom network we're kind of Greg are you a little bit but when I feel like we're having better conversations during the breaks and on the air. You just tell me about your desires impassioned to go play soccer in Europe I was a kid. I was a kid. Hey hey I mean if you're that good at soccer I was an idiot like yourself playing soccer and pleading you're simple answer on the dominance. That's why. It made out it and it over there sign up pretty loud K anyway speaking of Europe to Europeans atop the masters leaderboard. And you asked me was that you really funny we can consider that the senate this sit out on US revote is gonna walk that fast as it was Venus might asset. I yes I'll what I'll watch the message today it's food one in my Super Bowls of the year. This this leaderboard here. Just. So juicy. I love it. We have we want to win that I want to opt. And that's exactly right before the tournament began who I want to win. Was somebody that I had heard of I did not want a well known name winning this tournament Trevor Immelman or Danny Willett I do not want that I like when that happens. Outside of a guy whose when he or 21 but young young young you know not winning that's different I haven't heard of him. But I wanna see god and I know win. And right now I'm in position that to happen Sergio Justin did the final pairing followed by Ricky follow work. And speak. Towards speed will be in the final so I wanna see one of those four preferably went if I had a root for somebody every roofer Rickie Fowler. I think Debbie good for golf that he could win masters. Mom never won a major won the players championship a few years ago never won a masters and one major even put pretty good golf yeah correct over the past about you last year yet rue really good year and he's got to continue that continuing that and this year. The course is just immaculate as we know now based on what I've heard it's funny I lived in Georgia around the course. I think five minutes away there's a Wal-Mart. I mean it's not everything it saw it looks like right around Augusta Georgia not exactly not exactly Blake kind of tells the story is yeah it's it's different situation. So she'll economically buffalo house I don't I'm not looking outside the gates I'm looking at TV event off how those places it is thus are you kidding me you still live in Waffle House when I was in Georgia and Mississippi we have a ring Columbus but anyway. I'm excited about this leaderboard Sergio Garcia is never won a major. We know but the history of that guy he chokes every time so I can't wait to see how they'll choke if he'll choke given the do it a say if he'll choke even though I think there's a chance something about how I OP wins in excel I like we might see and that I wouldn't mind seeing them. I think I like him I've always liked him I was like the way he plays I I think he's of these good for the game. And in finally getting over the hall opened in winning a big would be huge for Justin Rose is nails Rory McIlroy. Lurking could you say he's working he's even par. He has a big I mean rose yesterday and in the third round was. Five under which he could put around our that are like so so for McIlroy to be really considered in the hunt I think he'd have to get. The three under by the mid point of his round and hope that the other guys are shoot par right. Yeah I'm. And the just just to be consider any needs far away but it's not something that's. Are you seeing guys who forged Qaeda throw up all of a two was a Jordan's beat a couple of years ago in the twelfth hole judge threw up all over himself and really kind of gave away the lead is so radical or do it it's eleven it's possible but I mean it's a big it's a big ask for back got to really get back into the are speaking about a big ask. The final round the final pairing rose Garcia Europeans Britain for them follower speak Americans. All what I love to see some kind of a Ryder Cup feel to Sunday at the mass with a tight kind of gone back and forth well the history even from the crowd now the match yes too classy for that that's what I mean but this is what golf needs it doesn't need people calling in. An error or are a violation all those people are those people who have been there the war sacks and I mean golf in that regard in America is gonna get into Alexis Thompson thing we talked during NASA's. Last week but. Golf in that regard he said doubt the NFL's mentality once the the next plays run whatever happened is over. What's the next shot is he's hit. It doesn't matter what up repeating such great then. There's enough time in between shots is a lot of into your rules that Stupak roll it hurts the game that that don't need to be in there and I think two people are too nice to each other and golf. When she should imagine she's an attitude welcome rivalries or I wanna see somebody. You're somebody you're the golf guy what's the what's the tournament in Phoenix where the crowd and I love that they don't Waste Management open I think yes they and they just it the eighteenth hole there are crowded around everybody and they're going nuts when when somebody's you know hits a good shot and there really engaged and in in the about the whole week we asked them that crowds like really not a you know they'd they'd. Course Drake and have a good time and enjoy themselves but they also aren't invested in the tournament and and show the support of the you know you can tell what a guy it's a good shot. On you know the seventeenth. If you're over at the eighteenth op on the greens and that those fans are into when you need a little bit more that. I'm all for sportsmanship but you need a little more edged we don't have time to get into this now but if you meet Karen you know what I would do with golf which you do. And there's there's weather involved I understand. Com. I think I wish you could be eighteen sport. I wish there were teams I think that would add to that I think that would. Pars banned them goes okay like like I'm like what if they have like which they got lake not only an individual championship at the end of the Arab alike. Point total for the Europeans in the Americans that they tallied up. For however those not either way I played a decent day you can make the PGA to war. And I decision doesn't have a ton of thought to it but if you could make the PGA tour and American League where it was. Cities had golf teams and the match the majors remain individual events now and the rest of the time. It was a team sport did you figure this at lake Ariel pointed out earlier change and I heard that I had a good thing. There if you could make it also each city was represented by a group of golfers I just feel like more cities who become involved every weekend. And you have almost maybe like a football kind of I don't know I too wish it to its it's a long. That the Darrell Korea. I put more into income measure it you should put up a little bit at the end of that but I'm. Don't really care about these these these you know he's mid level tournaments in the middle of the summer there may be if there's a team. I don't know it is something more in any amaze those individuals some of the more on the linemen then though I guess I disseminate data that would make the FedEx cup playoffs a little more into staying you know if if Jordan speed. Was playing for Boston that would make him more relevant in certain cities where Jersey. Now I'm just saying you play for the city and you represent the city not in a height do home games. Or let's. I don't think I'm a big thinker and you know it's our shot tech market. Is slightly higher up put together business plan presented. I don't think I mean it he's got to be away you brought that the shark tank they'd they'd give you thumbs down you've got that you begin a hard Nolan now one. Listen I'm this and is a I want I think there's ways for golf listen to I had more icy slope and it's been a long week you've had very little sleep there is tired. Okay we gotta yeah we excuse you for this week thank you walk. But yeah as far as the masses goes he should be a great finish with big names and that's what I'm looking for. From a tournament of this stature so we'll see Rory get an eagle on the first hole and then there Yeltsin. I don't know I -- to really kind of get get the crowd even mourn in the only bad part about that it it's just frustrating when a guy has come from that far behind in the he's done yeah still early yet and is waiting for the other people. You like for hit bad whatever our anchor find a way to play itself back towards the top of the leaderboard I don't care when he finishes just get up there like I said and mean if he has a good first. First first nine holes and he gets that three or four under ya. I mean then you got you got not morals are really to really get back into it and to be in contention for the sake I'll be honest that he no surprise me and maybe I just missed it. I can't believe that I haven't seen one thing from Tony Romo. At this golf tournament I got with a big signing yes as well yes with Manson and add CBS they were gonna we'll roll him out there. They haven't to a couple hits put among them. I don't know on the eighteenth hole I concede anything unless I missed it. But Tony Romo did it surprise you that he retired by the way. A little bit because I thought there you know he is here yeah I I think that the doctors told him that if he takes another hit. That it could be some serious problems for his back in the you know in the near future I think that's maybe but you know if he comes back. You rule out that he comes back. I'm not I mean it's it's it's just an odds I always comes back during the game get to call and during the game there's an awkward situation where he's talking about maybe having to be most pleased that you might not go black and not during that game and saying like hey next week. You know laugh at age I don't know Houston Lou you loses savage or or whatever else causes of his bill Sams I don't know if that could happen but I would love to see that meets these and that's all I'm saying it mid season. Can you imagine mid season something came up where he got a chance to send the blue CBS be pets I don't know why they put him in the number one Booth. I armaments battle like that I write up I Aaron I was really I'm really don't like that I mean give it to somebody that's earned it. You know I understand he's a quarterback he probably understands the game are pretty you know much better than. All of us do were talking about it sure but you know. I wrote I would think that you would want given opportunity is somebody that maybe is are there are on their role who may be but. Maybe you know get a little bit more high winds blew Troy Aikman spent some time doing NFL Europe games or something like yeah I mean you work anyway he wasn't the number one guy when he got immediately to foxy was number we was doing the best in rec games right away and he's awesome. Ending Collins were at they think are really good people. Collins worth because he's honest RB you know thirty you know there's thirty teams in the league that it. Thirty teams fans that hate and because he's honest about what he sees on the field in the same thing with same thing with Dayton. Are we get back some patriots stock we'll stick with football is the mark and Jason show won a three point seven WEEI.

Google's lawyer has called the lawsuit a "fishing expedition." Kim Jin-a/AP hide caption toggle caption Kim Jin-a/AP The Department of Labor is suing Google to obtain payroll data to determine whether the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. Google's lawyer has called the lawsuit a "fishing expedition." Kim Jin-a/AP Just three days after Google announced that it had "closed the gender pay gap globally" on Equal Pay Day, a Department of Labor official testified in federal court that there is "systemic" discrimination against women at Google. Silicon Valley has often come under fire in recent years for being unfriendly to women, with sexual harassment allegations and lawsuits over gender bias. But a DoL official told The Guardian Friday that Google's discrimination was "extreme," even for the industry. The government is suing Google, a government contractor, to release compensation data in order to make sure the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. In a press release about the lawsuit, the DoL said that Google has had "many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily," but has "refused to do so." Google, for its part, has denied that the company has a gender discrimination problem, and called the DoL's request a "fishing expedition." Harin Contractor was an economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor under President Obama, and he says the pay gap is complicated. There are a number of factors that contribute, including women taking time out of the workforce for maternity leave, or to care for aging parents or other relatives. But there is a portion of the pay gap that can't be accounted for by these situations. "These companies need to try a little harder to encourage diversity," Contractor says, adding that often in the tech industry the people making hiring and promotion decisions are white men. "Sometimes they can get caught up in their bubble and feel like they're very open," he says. "But when it's always the same type of person making the decisions. ... maybe it's not conscious." For the past several years, Google has released its diversity data publicly in an annual report, that has shown a persistent dearth of women and minorities at the top. Last year, women represented just 31 percent of Google's workforce, and held just 24 percent of leadership roles.

According to media reports, the department is currently investigating violations of federal employment laws among the Google workforce. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified in court in San Francisco on Friday. Wipper's words have been supported by those of Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the department. "The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters," Herold said, adding that the payment disparities in Google are "quite extreme, even in this industry." The department filed a lawsuit demanding Google provide its payment data in January. According to the media, Google is a federal contractor, which means it is required to allow the Labor Department to inspect and copy records and information about its compliance with equal opportunity laws. The tech giant has repeatedly opposed giving up the data; it took a formal lawsuit from the Labor Department for the company to  provide "hundreds of thousands of records," according to the company's spokesman, to the government. The spokesman underscored that the requests outlined in the complaint were "overbroad," revealed confidential information or violated employees' privacy. © AP Photo/ Sang Tan UK Gender Pay Gap Falls to 5% for Workers in 20s - Think TankAfter examining data provided that covered year 2015, the department reportedly discovered a payment disparity and demanded more data covering a longer period of time. It also demanded access to employees to interview them privately. "We want to understand what's causing the disparity," the department representative said. The company's attorney, Lisa Barnett Sween, testified in opening remarks that the Labor Deparment's request constituted a "fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review." According to media reports, she said the request was an unconstitutional violation of the company's fourth amendment right to protection from unreasonable searches. However, the department remains suspicious. Marc Pilotin, a Labor Department attorney, said: "For some reason or another, Google wants to hide the pay-related information." The disparities claimed by the government are yet to be proven before a court. In the meantime, the company denies all allegations and claims payment between genders is equal and based on professional qualities rather than on gender or race. The conflict between the department and Google is particularly interesting in light of US President Donald Trump's reversal of some Obama-era female workers' rights protections. If Google really practices payment discrimination, Trump's decision effectively plays in favor of the tech giant and against the department. Google Trump's presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and Silicon Valley in general was one of the main sources of funding for Clinton campaign. If Google representatives are right in calling the lawsuit "politically motivated," the politics are getting really awkward around here. ...

Building on the work done by Walter White, head of the NAACP in the 1940's and 1950's, President Kennedy and his team devoted hundreds of workhours to get this legislation right. Here is a link to its Federal Website for processing complaints of unequal pay for equal work regardless of race, creed, national origin, etc. www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm So my question is: why is there never, ever any reference to this Federal law in such discussions of American pay inequity please? This law states clearly that if it can be shown that there is an unequal pay for equivalent work situation in play, all back wages are due to the underpaid worker given proper documentation of the disparity and proof of the equivalency of the work done.

Or does a woman take more time off then the men ? Every time a menstrual cycle comes does she take off from work ? What happens when a woman get pregnant and takes maternity leave above and beyond what the company pays her ? Or how many times a woman says " I need a mental health day ?

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense.

Now it's coming to Google. By Mark Bergen. Added by Agency Staff on 9 April 2017. Saved under News Tags: Google, Sundar Pichai Tweet Google CEO Sundar Pichai First fact-checking came to Facebook. Now it’s coming to Google. The world’s largest search engine is rolling out a new feature that places “Fact Check” tags on snippets of articles in its News results. The company had already run limited tests. On Friday, it extended the capability to every listing in its News pages and massive search catalogue. This is the latest sign Google is responding to mounting pressure to police content it hosts online after criticism the company, and other Internet firms, help spread misinformation. Google isn’t entirely giving up its usual hands-off approach: the company is letting others do the fact-checking. The approach is meant to legitimise or question claims online, Google said in a blog post. Checked search results list the name of the person or group making the assertion and the determination of the fact checker. Although Google is working with established fact-checking organisations, like PolitiFact and Snopes, it’s also opening up the system to publishers including The Washington Post and The New York Times. In theory, media organisations could use the new feature to fact-check each other. Or publishers could give different verdicts on the veracity of the same article. “These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgments,” Google said. “Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.” While any publisher can apply to add fact-check labels to content, Google search algorithms will determine whether they appear in results, a spokeswoman said. The company plans to reserve the label for search results about addressable public claims of fact, rather than opinion. Publishers can write the labels that appear next to results. Examples include “True”, “Mostly False”, or “Pants on Fire!” (a favourite of PolitiFact). Outcry over the influence of misinformation, or “fake news”, began after the US presidential election. Facebook, a leading driver of online traffic to publishers in the US, took the brunt of criticism. On Thursday, the company introduced new features in its flagship social network designed to show users how to detect false news. But Google has not been immune to scrutiny. Critics have pointed to several instances of inaccurate and misleading articles surfacing in search results. Such examples are particularly stark when Google delivers what it finds in the form of tiny snippets, a priority for the company in recent years. “From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told BBC News shortly after the US election. Google is not paying publications or fact-checking organisations. A spokeswoman for Google said articles that used the new fact-check label would not be ranked differently in search results.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 30Now Fitch downgrades SA to junk 13SA is now junk – thanks to Jacob Zuma 8Beware ‘radical economic transformation’: Nyati 5Zuma has ‘done SA great harm’ 5The war on Kodi Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Hints about screenshot editing tools have been visible in teardowns of previous versions of the Google app and now those features are live for some users. This goes to show that Google is now testing those features before it decides whether or not it’s going to release them for all users. Taking a screenshot inside the Google app brings up the standard share sheet and now the sheet is also going to include an option to crop that screenshot or draw on it. When pressed, the crop button is going to bring up the regular crop tool which can be used to make adjustments to the picture. The Draw feature provides users with a basic palette of six colors that they can use to draw anything they want anywhere on the picture. Once the editing has been done, the Google app is going to display the sharing sheet once again so sharing the picture to the favored destinations is just one tap away. These features are currently being tested by Google and it’s unclear for now if and when the company plans on rolling them out to all users. We should find that out for sure in the coming weeks.

Home  >  Media  >  Digital  >  Ten easy ways to combat fake news AMEinfo EXPERTS by Ali Nehme Publicis Media Middle East by Paula Jane Cox Smart Life Goals VIEW ALL EXPERTS Ten easy ways to combat fake news April 9, 2017 5:30 pm Fake news became a leading cause of concern during the US election campaign when falsified stories circulated on social media. Concerns have been raised about hoaxes and misinformation affecting elections in Europe this year, with investigations showing how “click farms” generate revenue from online advertising using fabricated news stories. Google and Facebook aim to change the way news is ranked, diminishing the importance of how often a particular story is shared or clicked on. Both firms have already taken steps to cut off advertising revenues to news sites promoting misinformation. Facebook Facebook has rolled out an educational tool in news feeds to help users determine whether shared stories are real or fake. Facebook on Thursday ramped up its fight against “fake news” by adding tips on how to tell when shared stories are bogus. An initiative being launched in the US, France and a dozen other countries features an “awareness display” in news feeds. Facebook said in a blog: “By clicking on the awareness display located at the top of their news feed, users will be able to access a dedicated area that includes tips for identifying and reporting false information. Promoting a critical reading of information is a priority. False information goes against our mission of connecting people with what is important to them.” Tips included checking website addresses along with searching out other sources or articles on topics. Earlier this month, a global alliance of tech industry and academic organisations unveiled plans to work together to combat the spread of fake news and improve public understanding of journalism. The News Integrity Initiative debuted with $14 million from Facebook, the Ford Foundation, Mozilla and others, and is based at the City University of New York’s journalism school, which will coordinate research, projects and events. 10 ways to spot fake news on Facebook This week, users in 14 countries, including the U.S., will see an alert above the News Feed that links them to Facebook’s Help Center where they can read “Tips to Spot False News.” Written while working with news standards nonprofit First Draft, these tips include being skeptical of sensational headlines and checking for phony URLs. Here’s the list of tips users will find if they click through the link: 1.Be skeptical of headlines: False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are. 2. Look closely at the URL:A phony or look-alike URL may be a warning sign of false news. Many false news sites mimic authentic news sources by making small changes to the URL. You can go to the site and compare the URL to established sources. 3. Investigate the source: Ensure that the story is written by a source that you trust with a reputation for accuracy. If the story comes from an unfamiliar organization, check their “About” section to learn more. 4. Watch for unusual formatting: Many false news sites have misspellings or awkward layouts. Read carefully if you see these signs. 5. Consider the photos: False news stories often contain manipulated images or videos. Sometimes the photo may be authentic, but taken out of context. You can search for the photo or image to verify where it came from. 6. Inspect the dates: False news stories may contain timelines that make no sense, or event dates that have been altered. 7. Check the evidence:Check the author’s sources to confirm that they are accurate. Lack of evidence or reliance on unnamed experts may indicate a false news story. 8. Look at other reports.If no other news source is reporting the same story, it may indicate that the story is false. If the story is reported by multiple sources you trust, it’s more likely to be true. 9. Is the story a joke?Sometimes false news stories can be hard to distinguish from humor or satire. Check whether the source is known for parody, and whether the story’s details and tone suggest it may be just for fun. 10. Some stories are intentionally false.Think critically about the stories you read, and only share news that you know to be credible. Google Google is adding a fact-checking tag to search results globally, its latest initiative to help curb the spread of misinformation and ‘fake news’. The new tags, to be used in all languages for users worldwide, will use third-party fact-checkers to indicate whether news items are true, false or somewhere in-between. A blog post from Google said: “For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page. The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim.” The information will not be available for every search result, and there may be conflicting conclusions in some cases, Google said in the blog post, from researcher Cong Yu and Justin Kosslyn of Google’s sister company Jigsaw. It said: “These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgments. Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.” Google has worked with 115 fact-checking groups worldwide for the initiative, which began last year.

Rather than select one egregious lie in particular, Politifact felt that fake news had so distorted and undermined the integrity of real news, that this phenomenon as a whole deserved the infamous award. Now a few months into 2017, fake news continues to remain a problem. To help combat it, Google and Facebook have both recently come out with new tools and features that can help inform their users on how to distinguish true stories from fake ones. Google “Fact Check” Tags On Friday, Google announced that it would expand its use of fact check tags. These tags appear underneath search results that have been reviewed by fact-checking institutions (Politifact, for instance) and quickly summarize the outcome of that review in an information box. This box briefly mentions what claim the article is making, who is the source of that claim, and whether the claim is true, false, or a shade in between. The Google tag also includes a link to the fact-checking website itself, where an individual can read an in-depth analysis on why the claim received that result. Google is rolling out a fact check feature in its search and news results – Recode https://t.co/7gWJORXEji #tech #news — Semin Alkic (@seminalkic) April 9, 2017 But as Google made clear in a blog post, the fact-checking feature will apply only to some entries, and won’t always lead to cut-and-dried conclusions. “This information won’t be available for every search result, and there may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions. These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgements.” Google originally introduced this feature back in October of last year, but only for those articles appearing on Google News, and only in the US and UK. The announcement on Friday, however, declared that in its quest to curb fake news, Google will now be launching this feature globally. In addition, the tags will appear on general search results as well as on Google News, making it harder for users to click on a fake news story without seeing the tag. Facebook Notification Facebook has also decided to join the fight, creating an “educational tool” meant to instruct people on discerning real news from fake. Over the course of a week, it plans to display notifications at the top of its users’ News Feed, which, when clicked on, will take the user to the Facebook Help Center. Here they’ll find tips on how to spot false news. Some tips include researching a websites’ sources to verify their accuracy and checking other news outlets to see if the story in question is being reported anywhere else. Adam Mosseri, vice president of News Feed at Facebook, emphasized the importance of this tool in a new post. “Improving news literacy is a global priority, and we need to do our part to help people understand how to make decisions about which sources to trust.” This recent move by Facebook is only the latest in an effort to cut back the spread of fake stories across its platform. Will the new efforts succeed? There’s no saying for sure whether the new tools employed by Google and Facebook will succeed. Indeed, the point of fake news is to appear indistinguishable from the real stuff. Those who manufacture these falsehoods will likely find some way to adapt. Breitbart, for instance, has already begun sowing doubt about Google and it’s fact-checking tags. A recent article from the site dismissed Snopes and Politifact — two organizations that Google uses for the service — as partisan groups that are incapable of judging the truth of a claim impartially. Dismissing the fact-checkers is merely one way of dismissing their findings. I feel safer going to sleep at night knowing that "Facebook takes false news seriously" ???????? pic.twitter.com/SSNTkLmaRr — Culture For Freedom (@CulturOfFreedom) April 9, 2017 In this new era of pervasive falsehoods and rampant misinformation campaigns, it becomes all the more challenging, and yet all the more vital, to reject unfounded claims such as those proposed by Breitbart. That’s why the work Google and Facebook have begun in weeding out fake news is essential. As Politifact put it, “When we can’t agree on basic facts — or even that there are such things as facts — how do we talk to each other?” [Featured Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] Now Watch This: Donald Trump Seeks Support For Tax Reform Now Read This: Marine Le Pen Receiving Support From The Gay Community In French Election Share 0 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Max Cohen Tags: Facebook, fake news, google November 3, 2013 Kendall Jenner Turns 18, Porn Offers Flood Her Inbox November 3, 2013 Nick Foles Throws 7 TDs, Ties NFL Record Facebook 13 hours ago Abeku Wilson’s Instagram Page Rages With Steroid Rage, RIP, And Racist Comments – Facebook, Twitter Reactions 21 hours ago Facebook, Google, And The War Against Fake News – How Two Technology Giants Are Ramping Up The Fight Comments LATEST HEADLINES WWE Legend Ric Flair Was Kicked Out Of A Bar Kendall Jenner’s Post-Pepsi Porn Proposal And Jenner’s Passionate Response NHL: Bryan Bickell Scores In Final Game, Five Months After MS Diagnosis ‘Southern Charm’ Thomas Ravenel Takes Heat After Saying He Keeps His Kids In The Guest House Kim Kardashian Gets Anxiety At Kanye West’s Concert Before Hospitalization Marine Le Pen Receiving Support From The Gay Community In French Election ‘Game Of Thrones’ Season 7 Spoilers: What Is Braavos’ Role In The Brewing War?

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sheikh Hasina Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Arvind Kejriwal Yogi Adityanath Home Sci/Tech US regulators accuse Google of underpaying female workers Shares1 Sun, 9 Apr 2017-01:19pm , PTI Government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees have accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A US Department of Labour official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labour Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," Google said in its statement. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 per cent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labour Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labour Department is now scrutinising Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts.

(AP photo) - + NEW YORK - Google will expand the use of "fact check'' tags in its search results -- the tech industry's latest effort to combat false and misleading news stories. People who search for a topic in Google's main search engine or the Google News section will see a conclusion such as "mostly true'' or "false'' next to stories that have been fact checked. Google has been working with more than 100 news organisations and fact-checking groups, including The Associated Press, the BBC and NPR. Their conclusions will appear in search results as long as they meet certain formatting criteria for automation. Google said only a few of those organisations, including PolitiFact and Snopes.com, have already met those requirements; The Washington Post also says it complies. Google said it expects the ranks of compliant organisations to grow following Friday's announcement. Not all news stories will be fact checked. Multiple organisations may reach different conclusions; Google will show those separately. Still unanswered is whether these fact-check analyses will sway people who are already prone to believe false reports because they confirm preconceived notions. Glenn Kessler, who writes "The Fact Checker" column at The Washington Post, said in an email that Google's efforts should at least "make it easier for people around the world to obtain information that counters the spin by politicians and political advocacy groups, as well as purveyors of 'fake news.''' He added that "over time, I expect that people increasingly will want to read a fact-check on a controversial issue or statement, even if the report conflicts with their political leanings.'' Google started offering fact check tags in the United States and the United Kingdom in October and expanded the programme to a handful of other countries in the subsequent months. Now the programme is open to the rest of the world and to all languages. False news and misinformation, often masquerading as trustworthy news that spreads on social media, has gained attention since the 2016 US presidential election. Google's announcement comes a day after Facebook launched a resource to help users spot false news and misleading information that spreads on its service. The resource is basically a notification that pops up for a few days. Clicking on it takes people to tips and other information on how to spot false news and what to do about it.

By Luke Johnson / Published 9th April 2017 GETTY/GOOGLE MAPS MISSTEP? Google has ditched one of Maps's best features Google Maps is constantly evolving, offering ever more accurate maps and new, more user-friendly features. It just made the unusual decision to drop one of its most useful features, however. The Google Maps feature that’s been shown the door in is the Google Map Maker functionality. The powerful editing suite let Google Maps users build roads, correct terrain, landmarks and create buildings from scratch to bring the in-app content up to date with real world developments. The strangest finds on Google Maps Friday, 19th February 2016 Since it launched in 2007, Google Street View quickly became known for bizarre scenes from around the globe, whether they were funny photobombing seagulls to more sobering scenes of people carrying weapons 1 / 17 Reddit A couple are caught having sex on Google Maps In order to stop users abusing the tool, submitted additions were added to a moderation queue. Google Maps community members would then decide if the edits were necessary and correct, and if so, updates to the map data were rolled out in the software’s continuous background patches. It wasn’t always a foolproof system though, with an Android logo uniting on an Apple logo once hitting the service. Now, however, the search giant has ditched the feature entirely. Although some functionality has been migrated to the mobile versions of the service, the ability to build completely new roads and builidngs has been lost for good. GOOGLE Google Map Maker was first introduced back in 2008, and has been a mainstay of the software for the past nine years. It is believed it’s been killed off over concerns surrounding the moderation process. Google, however, still wants user contributions to its mapping software, just in a new guise. That will be the responsibility of the new Local Guides program. Writing on a new support page, Google has stated: “Since 2008, the Google Map Make community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience. “To make it easier for all Google Maps users to contribute changes to the map, we’ve started to graduate functionality from Map Maker to Google Maps on both desktop and mobile. “We’ll continue to add new editing features within Google Maps on an ongoing basis. “To keep contributing your local knowledge to Google Maps and engage with a passionate community of likeminded individuals, we invite you to join the Local Guides program.” Earlier this month Google celebrated April Fool’s Day be letting users transform their mobile Google Maps app into a real world, playable game of Ms Pac-Man.

No doubt the red card affected things, but United were ahead by then and looking more likely to extend their lead than have it pegged back. So, they forsake their beloved sixth place once more - at least until Arsenal play Crystal Palace tomorrow night - while Sunderland stay bottom, where they’ve been since 24th September. They do still have to play the three teams above them, but to all intents and purposes, they’re done. Dejected Victor Anichebe after the final whistle.

Sorry, the emperor’s in the nuddy, it was a terrible game. Long balls, diving and cynical fouls all night. I remember the Irish commentary team signing off ‘A good night for West Germany, but a bad night for football.’ Says it all really.” I only said it was epic - I’d need to rewatch it again to be sure, but I think it was. What you want, and what a tournament needs to be a classic, is the best teams going at it. That, I think, was that.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.22am EDT 10:22 GOAL! Sunderland 0-3 Manchester United (Rashford 88) Lovely goal, this. Pogba snaps an excellent pass down the right for Rashford, whose clever feet chop the ball inside for Zlatan. He’s got Martial in aeons over on the right of the box, but instead he waits for yerman, sliding him a return which is unerringly dispatched across Pickford, low into the bottom corner. That’s his first league goal since September. Rashford scores United’s third.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.13am EDT 10:13 82 min Martial is late on Pickford, barging him over as he clears; he’s booked. While we’re on the subject, I fear for Martial - he’s an incredible talent and already a bloody good player, but it looks a lot like Mourinho’s already made up his mind. I’d expect United to sign two attackers in the summer, and that might well be enough to send Martial elsewhere.

He doesn’t get quite enough of it, though, and the keeper catches above his head. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.07am EDT 10:07 74 min There’s general phutting and sputtering going on now, so a question: ought Mourinho to have brought on one of Fosu-Mensah or Tuanzebem instead of Blind?

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.05am EDT 10:05 72 min “USA 94 is due some rehabilitation,” asserts Niall Mullen. “Especially given the dross we’ve had to endure since 2002. Romario, Bergkamp, Stoitchkov, Baggio and Hagi all played wonderfully. It was also one of the most storied World Cups ever. Bookended by 2 tragic penalty misses (Ross & Baggio) you had the greatest player of all time sent home, two of the most brutal elbows ever seen on a pitch, a literally fatal own-goal and the birth of the baby rocking celebration (the one and only time it was cool/acceptable). It was certainly a much better tournament than the ultra defensive horror show of Italia 90.” Agree with some of this. I do think it was a good tournament, but the semis and final stopped it being a classic. Italia 90, on the other hand, had two epic semis. Also, you missed this in your rundown: Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.02am EDT 10:02 70 min Pogba, who’s been quiet, pounces on a loose ball in centrefield and measures a pass aimed to send Rashford through the middle.

But the ball finds its way to Zlatan on the right of the box, and his low cross is deflected by Denayer, forcing Pickford, already grounded, to crab football away with his feet before Herrera bangs a shot high. Do people still play crab football? Ibrahimovic sends on in.

United knock the ball around for a bit, Sunderland doing nothing to stop them; that must’ve been some teamtalk. Eventually, Mkhitaryan gets possession, inside the box, left-hand side, and with Kone doing nothing to unload him, he shifts the angle, then drags a decent shot into the far corner. I think Sunderland might lose this one. Mkhitaryan thumps home the second for United.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.29am EDT 09:29 “Can keep hard tackles but get rid of studs up over the ball tackles,” reckons Niall Mullen. “Rugby has pretty much eliminated tip-tackles and high tackles by penalising them all regardless of whether the recipient was injured or not.” It’s a tricky one - Larsson’s effort was marginal, by that standard. At the start of the 1994 World Cup, they decided that any tackle from behind would get a red card, which led to some pretty odd and unnecessary calls - Marco Etcheverry in the opening match springs to mind. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.24am EDT 09:24 “I say that red card is good news on multiple fronts,” emails JR in Illinois (1060 West Addison I hope). “It’s good for the Sunderland fans because they can now focus their energy on booing Herrera for getting studded by Larsson and it’s good for Mourinho because he now will have the ‘difficulty of playing against 10 men’ excuse for another unconvincing performance.” Or, in other words, whatever else you do today, DO NOT WATCH THE SECOND HALF OF THIS.

Straight red? Absurd decision,” tweets @steammyteabuns. As I said, I see why it was given - and I suppose there’s an argument, popular again after what happened to Seamus Coleman, that potentially dangerous tackles should be eliminated from the game. Personally, I think that occasional awful challenges are the price you pay for the hard challenges that are part of things - they just need punishing properly.

Anyway, Larsson misses a challenge with Pogba, then scurries on and half-launches himself towards Herrera. His foot sort of goes over the ball and he’s not quite in control - he sort of goes through his man in the follow-through, but barely.

But then a cross comes in from the left, which Anichebe, moving across Bailly, touches into his own path. Though he’s got to swivel to shoot as the ball runs away from him, it still looks a goal for all the world - but while Bailly attempts a trip, Romero spreads himself superbly, wearing the finish round about the right pec. He didn’t look it when he signed for United, but he is really good.

But before we can clear the courts, we will need to have a period where human drivers share the responsibility (both actual and legal) for control of their vehicles. Arriving at the point where fully automated vehicles are on our roads requires us to establish who is legally in control of them. If we don’t, we could find that we have simply replaced one type of legal dispute with another. Traffic offences More than 200,000 people in Australia were found guilty of driving and traffic offences in the 12 months to June last year, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. The most common crimes were driving while intoxicated (71,501 cases) and speeding (16,461 cases). Other offences included failing to obey traffic signs and signals, and careless driving. In some parts of Australia these offences are increasing in frequency, placing a growing burden on our courts. All because of wrongdoing or careless conduct of a human in charge of a motor vehicle. By contrast, fully automated vehicles have established an impressive compliance and safety record, so far. There have been very few reported crashes, although they obviously cause concern when they occur, such as the crash last year that led to the death of the driver of a Tesla car in autopilot mode. Most crashes involving autonomous vehicles are less serious than that, and are due to the errors of other (human) drivers, such as last month’s Uber collision in Arizona and the 16 crashes reported by Google between 2009 and 2015. Google’s cars have been involved in further accidents, including one last February when its autonomous Lexus pulled out into a bus. The safety record of autonomous vehicles is frequently contrasted with research that identifies that more than 90% of regular vehicle collisions are caused by human error. As the number of fully automated cars on our roads increases, we should expect to see a reduction in the number of traffic offences coming before our courts. In Victoria alone these offences currently account for nearly 21,000 cases heard each year in the Magistrates’ Court. Drivers, passengers and ‘chaperones’ The removal of the human driver has the potential to make some criminal charges unnecessary. This could include charges of driving while intoxicated, unlicensed driving, and driving with a disqualified, suspended or cancelled licence. Making these offences redundant in Victoria, for example, would remove about 29,000 cases annually from the Magistrates’ Court. But reform may be necessary to clarify the legal situation. In Victoria the definition of “drives” in the Road Safety Act 1986 includes “to be in control of a vehicle”. Drink and drug driving offences refer to a person who “drives … or is in charge of a motor vehicle”. Would a person who enters a fully automated car that unlocks as they approach it, who gives verbal directions as to their destination (and leaves it to the car to determine the route), be said to be in control or in charge of the car? If that person is not in control of the car, then who is? And what if the vehicle in question is an Uber vehicle, taxi or bus? Who is responsible for the actions of that vehicle – the hirer, the owner or the manufacturer? It is interesting to note that the staff member present in Curtin University’s recently introduced fully automated bus is referred to as a “chaperone”. In essence, a key legal issue will be to determine whether a person present in a fully automated car is more like a driver or a passenger. Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk said his company will accept liability for fully automated vehicles where a problem stems from a design fault. But he also suggested that in other circumstances, individuals and their insurers may be responsible. Some clarification of the legal position may be required. A report, released by the UK government’s Department for Transport in February 2015, warned that with fully automated vehicles: […] it does not seem reasonable to suggest that the human driver is still responsible for the manner in which the vehicle drives since they may not even be aware of the road environment or the presence of other road users. The transition phase: semi-automated vehicles While fully automated vehicles are not yet freely driving on Australian roads (the Curtain bus is restricted to a specified route), many Australian drivers already use cruise control, electronic stability control, parking assist and advanced braking systems to help them drive their cars. Human drivers can override these automatic settings at any time, and may be required to do so to avoid colliding with cyclists, pedestrians, animals and stationary vehicles – all of which may not be detected by the automated programs. Consequently, manufacturers warn drivers of semi-automated vehicles that they must remain alert and ready to resume control in the case of adverse environmental conditions or unexpected events. Because of this shared responsibility for control of the vehicle, we might expect legal problems in attributing responsibility when something goes wrong. Fault could rest with a human driver who fails to take control when required to do so, or with a manufacturer whose product is faulty. While some car manufacturers – such as Volvo with its Pilot assist – say that drivers bear responsibility for controlling the car even when the semi-automated program is used, the situation might be more complex. It may be that the semi-automated program itself causes the problem. News reports from the US say that federal authorities have already expressed concern that a safety device on a semi-automated car may itself cause accidents. In these situations it may not be so easy for manufacturers to escape liability.

Kim Jin-a/AP hide caption toggle caption Kim Jin-a/AP The Department of Labor is suing Google to obtain payroll data to determine whether the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. Google's lawyer has called the lawsuit a "fishing expedition." Kim Jin-a/AP Just three days after Google announced that it had "closed the gender pay gap globally" on Equal Pay Day, a Department of Labor official testified in federal court that there is "systemic" discrimination against women at Google. Silicon Valley has often come under fire in recent years for being unfriendly to women, with sexual harassment allegations and lawsuits over gender bias. But a DoL official told The Guardian Friday that Google's discrimination was "extreme," even for the industry. The government is suing Google, a government contractor, to release compensation data in order to make sure the company is complying with equal opportunity laws. In a press release about the lawsuit, the DoL said that Google has had "many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily," but has "refused to do so." Google, for its part, has denied that the company has a gender discrimination problem, and called the DoL's request a "fishing expedition." Harin Contractor was an economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor under President Obama, and he says the pay gap is complicated. There are a number of factors that contribute, including women taking time out of the workforce for maternity leave, or to care for aging parents or other relatives. But there is a portion of the pay gap that can't be accounted for by these situations. "These companies need to try a little harder to encourage diversity," Contractor says, adding that often in the tech industry the people making hiring and promotion decisions are white men. "Sometimes they can get caught up in their bubble and feel like they're very open," he says. "But when it's always the same type of person making the decisions. ... maybe it's not conscious." For the past several years, Google has released its diversity data publicly in an annual report, that has shown a persistent dearth of women and minorities at the top. Last year, women represented just 31 percent of Google's workforce, and held just 24 percent of leadership roles.

You can revisit old haunts and take a virtual walk at street level. There's also lots of amusement to be had planning a route and making a rude shape with it. Until recently, users could also suggest edits and make revisions on the map database. But that's now changed. This had allowed maps to be updated with valuable local knowledge as building or construction changes were made. This particular functionality has been in place since 2008 and meant maps were kept fresh and up-to-date by people in the know. The Google Maps app is seen on an Apple iPhone 4S (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Sadly, because the edit function was open to all users, it meant that it got abused meaning all suggestions had to be moderated. Given the sheer volume of suggestions, the task of moderating each one was enormous, and proved to be too large. Google released a statement explaining their decision: "Since 2008, the Google Map Make community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Stupid idea, Googe needs to make the Shopping List avaiable OFFLINE aswell or it is just not fit for purpose. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHbz20mJ47I ytpunx14 I can understand the frustration here. I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch.

The search giant has deemed that QR codes were not as effective as the company had originally envisioned, and the move could be seen as paving way for a greater push with integrated NFC, or near field communications, technology that Google has launched with the Android 2.3 Gingerbread-enabled Samsung-made Nexus S smartphone. In its old form, QR codes contained additional information about local places, including prior customers’ comments and reviews. Users interested in viewing that information could pull out a smartphone and scan the QR code using the phone’s camera to search and retrieve the value-added information. Because the technology required the appropriate app–usually a free download from a smartphone’s app store–and the active participation of the user to launch the app, scan the code, and wait for the search results to be retrieved, the success of integrating QR codes as a link between Google and the local destination was seen as limited. In a note to blog Blumenthals, Google says, “Users will no longer find unique QR codes in their Places accounts. We’re exploring new ways to enable customers to quickly and easily find information about local businesses from their mobile phones.” The push behind NFC support may help increase usage behind local search as users will no longer need to actively participate in the process–no more app or scanner tool to download and no more scanning and waiting for results. Instead, users can just wave their NFC-enabled phone in front of an NFC terminal and the information will be wirelessly conveyed to the phone. Additionally, NFC support may provide an untapped revenue stream for the search giant as well. With NFC being eyed as the technology of choice by many banks, credit cards and electronic commerce companies, smartphone-makers, and other partners for digital wallets and mobile payment mechanisms, Google’s early adoption and implementation of an NFC payment mechanism can provide Google with added income in terms of transaction fees similar to those accessed by credit card companies to merchants when customers swipe their plastic cards. Additionally, by combining local advertising, perhaps, with Google Places, Google may find additional ways to monetize its efforts. 7 Responses 03/31/2011 Dave McLoughlin Reply It is very difficult to imagine that this is the death of the QR Code. It just makes things so much more confusing for the tech world, with many different products that can communicate with devices. The QR Code is becoming ubitqious. When has anything other than Google’s search engine ever become ubitiquious? 03/31/2011 Dave McLoughlin Reply other than Android… 03/31/2011 QR Code Marketing Reply I do see NFC as a better way to process payments, but in terms of marketing I think QR Codes will continue to grow in popularity. 03/31/2011 Patrick Donnelly Reply I believe these can coexist. 04/01/2011 Mikey Reply QR codes are not dead. In fact they are thriving. The increase of QR codes has been rising exponentially. Google may not see QR codes as a prioirity to other application they are working on but there is continued education and acceptance of QR codes in several industries such as real estate, consumer goods, etc. It is a great tool to store your contact info too. It has been used for payments as well. You should try to use a dynamic qr code generator that allows you to update your info in the code later without changing the code itself. Also, make sure you use a platform that provides real-time analytics.

According to a report in the Guardian on Saturday, The DoL, which is investigating the case, claims to have evidence of “systemic compensation disparities”. The allegations surface days after Google announced on Equal Pay Day that it had “closed the gender pay gap globally”. “Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today,” @Google tweeted earlier this week. The government has collected information that points towards the violation of federal employment laws by Google, the DoL said. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” the report quoted Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testifying in a San Francisco court, as saying. The investigation in the case is not complete, but the DoL has said the government’s analysis at this point indicated discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology,” a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying.

Here's what they are. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Apr 9, 2017 at 7:17AM Some might say I'm taking on way too much risk. Others might say I've just gotten lucky. Both could be right. Here's the undeniable fact: When I combine my holdings of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), they account for 35% of my family's stock holdings. So, when I tell you I think you can buy and hold these two companies forever, my money is firmly where my mouth is. Image source: Getty Images. It's worth pointing out that I never intended for things to be this way. Both Amazon and Alphabet -- better known as Google -- have grown significantly into their current positions. I just have no intention of selling. That's because both satisfy the four most important things I look for in an investment. A wide moat Over time, I've learned the hard way that the strength of a moat -- or a sustainable competitive advantage -- is the most important factor in determining whether to invest in a company. Put the simplest way, a moat is what differentiates one company from the next -- and keeps the competition at bay. Alphabet's moat is provided by the dominance of Google's search engine. Netmarketshare.com estimates that Google has a 77% market share of desktop searches, and 96% of mobile searches. That allows the company to collect gobs of data to help advertisers hit specific potential customers, something advertisers are more than willing to pay up for. But it doesn't stop at search. Alphabet now has six other products with over 1 billion users: Google Maps, Gmail, Chrome, Android, Google Play Store, and YouTube. That's a powerful ecosystem. Amazon, on the other hand, benefits from both physical advantages of scale and -- increasingly -- the network effect. On scale, the company has spent billions building out its network of mammoth fulfillment centers. These centers -- there are an estimated 95 stateside, with 26 more on the way -- help ensure that everything you order on Amazon gets to your front door as soon as possible. It would be prohibitively expensive for any company to try and match this scale. On the other hand, Amazon's third-party selling option has gained a lot of attention lately. Sales from retail third-party seller services doubled in the last two years alone, to $23 billion. What this means is that more non-Amazon retailers are using Amazon's platform to sell products. That incentivizes more buyers to use Amazon -- and based on estimates of Amazon Prime customers counts, they are doing so in droves. It's a virtuous cycle that continues to build steam. Optionality in spades Here's how optionality works in the real world: You do hundreds of experiments, tinkering with what will work. Most of your efforts will fail, but your losses will be small. Every now and again, you'll happen upon a big hit, and it will provide a meaningful source of future income. You have the option of killing off or further pursuing your experiments. Amazon is the King of Optionality. It started as an online bookstore but has branched into e-readers, retail, cloud services, original content, and even delivery services. No quote better sums up CEO Jeff Bezos' attitude toward optionality than this, when addressing the failure of the company's Fire Phone: You need to be making big, noticeable failures. The great thing is that, when you take this approach, a small number of winners pay for dozens, hundreds of failures.  Alphabet's decision to rename itself to differentiate the company's "Other Bets" is just another way of saying that it, too, is focused on optionality. The company is variously focusing on a connected house through Nest, self-driving cars, and faster Internet via Google Fiber. And there's no telling what might come out of Google[x] in the coming years. Skin in the game Author, trader, and academic Nassim Taleb has written often about how important it is that decision-makers have their own skin in the game. Without it, those who rely on such decision-makers have no recourse against the hidden risks inherent in any complex organization. That's why I find it heartening that both Amazon and Alphabet are founder-led companies, with both founders having a significant portion of their skin in the game. Company Founder Shares Owned Value Voting Rights Amazon Jeff Bezos 83 million about $74 billion 17.6% Alphabet Larry Page 21 million about $18 billion 26.6% Alphabet Sergey Brin 20 million about $17 billion 25.9% Data sources: Most recent company DEF 14A filings. The people running these companies have even more incentive than you and I do to see long-term success take hold. Financial fortitude Finally, I think it's important that any business I invest in have financial resources on hand to weather an economic downturn. In both Amazon and Alphabet, I believe we have those things. Company Cash Debt Free Cash Flow Amazon $26 billion $7 billion $10 billion Alphabet $92 billion $4 billion $26 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. All figures for the 2016 fiscal year, rounded to the nearest billion. When you combine these four factors: a wide moat, optionality, skin in the game, and financial fortitude, I believe you have the ingredients for a winner. That's why these companies comprise such an enormous part of my portfolio, and it's why I think you can buy and hold these stocks forever.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

These two nascent voice assistants are both trying to get their virtual feet in the door of your home, and many consumers--our readers among them--are trying to decide which is best. ThursdayFridaySaturday writes: My partner and I are discussing which one to get. They have an Amazon Prime Account so the reason they want the Echo is not only because of the discount, but most of their music and content is also worked through Amazon. Personally, I'm leaning towards the Google Home because it supports multiple accounts, has better customization, and I think their search engine works a little better than the other one. Which one should I get? First, let me clarify one thing: the $129 Google Home supports only a single account per device, so you wouldn't be able to switch between yours and your partner's Google account on a single Google Home. (There is a Guest mode, but that's not quite the same). Nevertheless, Google Home is still a great device; whether you go with it or the Echo comes down to how you're planning to use it. If you have, or plan to control, a lot of smart-home devices, such as lights, locks, thermostats and more, Alexa and the $179 Amazon Echo are your best bet. The Echo currently works with a much wider range of smart-home devices than Google Home, though the latter is catching up. Considering your partner has an Amazon Prime membership, getting the Echo may make more sense, as you can take advantage of a number of things, such as streaming music from Amazon Music Unlimited and making purchases online. Google Home's search engine is more robust than Alexa's, as the former taps into Google to get answers to just about anything. You can also use it to look up nearby businesses and make reservations. Also, if you have a Chromecast device — or Chromecast-enabled TV — you can tell Google Home to start streaming audio or video using nothing but your voice. You can also customize the look of your Google Home; its base can be swapped out for one of six different colors, each of which cost $20. Despite these advantages for Google Home, the Amazon Echo looks like the best choice for your needs, as it will let you take fuller advantage of your partner's Prime account. Check out our in-depth head-to-head between the Amazon Echo and Google Home for additional comparisons. Photo credit: Tom's Guide Need smart-home advice?

We had the Echo since it launched and now several GHs. The Echo has commands that you memorize. The GH has no commands and you talk to it like you would a human. So for example the Echo has the command "Song goes like ..." so I would would do a quick Google search because I could rarely remember how it went but knew other stuff. Then with the song name ask Alexa. With the GH you skip the search step. You just ask with whatever you have and the Google inference is amazing. Well like search. But it is the human touches with the GH that gets me. Started asking GH something and say "I forgot" and shes saids "no worries happens to me all the time". But then another time I say "nevermind" and she saids "yes, lets move forward". It is amazing and assume it learned how to do this by Google crawling the web all these years for their search engine. The two devices are NOT alike and drives me crazy when people compared. 0 Clayton_16 Apr 9, 2017, 5:51 AM …. The Echo currently works with a much wider range of smart-home devices than Google Home… My Google Home (4 of them) are all integrated into my home automation SmartThing hub and have access to all my Home automation devices. GH works with IFTT to expand even more options. So I’m not sure if the comment means direct control of device with no intermediary. For me I like an intermediary device since it allows me a clean and powerful interface to home automation. So from my GH I can say commands such as ‘Ok Google turn on night mode’ – This causes GH to shut off all my lights, close my garage doors, Turn off my TV and various Sonos player ‘Ok google turn off/on device’ Any device I have hooked up to SmartThing is turned on or off. With some having additional volume or dimming capability. All in all, I have found GH to be a very good voice command interface to my home automation 0 Steve_P82 Apr 9, 2017, 11:16 AM You're 1000% off base. The GH is infinitely better as it's not a vehicle to drive Amazon sales! I had both and the GH is easier to use, is contextual, and is backed up by the power of Google which is more powerful then the sales driven model of the Echo. More times then not when I'm trying to get information about something GH is stellar and rarely misses a beat, while the Echo ends of trying to buy stuff off Amazon. 0 Mprice33 Apr 9, 2017, 6:04 PM Here's a thought. The Echo Dot is $49 and can work by itself or plugged into amother speaker system. It also supports Bluetooth. We plugged the Echo Dot into our Home Theater system and dedicated 2 of the 7 speakers to it. I enabled Alexa's Bluetooth to my Samsung phone and now Alexa and Google can both answer our question though the same system. At this point in time Alexa has the edge with Home Automation but I believe Google has the best long term prospects in the voice assistant space due to a better search engine. We will probably get GH too once the price drops to Echo Dot's territory. 0 Comment Firstname Submit Latest in Smart Home News Lightform Projects Augmented Reality in Your Home News This Crazy Speaker Combines Alexa and Google Assistant by Althea Chang Apr 7, 2017, 6:20 AM News The Next Google Home Could Spell Trouble for Amazon by Althea Chang Apr 6, 2017, 7:44 AM News Apple Patent Hints at Amazon Echo Killer by Don Reisinger Apr 6, 2017, 6:34 AM Best Picks Best Wi-Fi Extenders 2017 by Brian Nadel Apr 4, 2017, 8:50 AM Best Picks Best Wireless Home Security Cameras 2017 by Tom’s Guide Staff Apr 4, 2017, 7:25 AM Round-Up The Best Smart Home Devices That Work with Google Home by Dan Moren Apr 3, 2017, 1:00 PM The Latest On Tom’s Guide How-To 14 hr 12 Tips for Taking Amazing Landscape Photos Round-Up 15 hr Best Workout Apps Reference 16 hr When Does an Old Smartphone Become Unsafe to Use?

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch.

Some Nexus 6Ps have developed a battery early shutoff problem, and it's becoming a safety issue David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/12/20 11:10am PDTDec 20, 2016 211 Plus 1 on G+ 366 Share on Facebook 174 Share on Twitter Total Shares751 News Nexus 6P A number of Nexus 6P owners have reported an alarming battery problem with their phones as of Android 7.0 being released for the handset, which causes the phone to power down when the battery gauge still shows anywhere from 10 to 60% battery remaining. How widespread the issue is at this point isn't clear, but the main thread on the Google issue tracker has 229 stars. There are also a significant number of threads describing the problem on Google's Product Forums (see: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Owners have linked it to Android 7.0, but even those who have attempted flashing back to Marshmallow report the problem still occurs, though generally at lower indicated remaining battery percentages than on Nougat. This suggests some kind of change in Android 7.0 that is exacerbating what would appear to be an underlying hardware problem. There are some reports that 6P owners with the issue who have their batteries replaced see the problem largely alleviated, again pointing to what seems fundamentally a hardware failure that has been made worse by software. While Google has assigned the issue in its tracker, it's been given a low priority and there has been no indication of an incoming fix. Those who have attempted to receive warranty service from Huawei have been rebuffed, with the OEM telling them the problem is not with the phone or the battery, but with Google's changes to the software. Interestingly, it seems the problem is most common in very cold climates. These are where we see reports of phones dying at upwards of 60% battery remaining indicated, which is obviously completely ridiculous. As some on the various threads point out, this could easily be a major safety issue. We have become deeply reliant on our smartphones to help us get around - be it hail an Uber, navigate us to our destination with a map, or simply to call or text a person to let them know where or when we'll be. Such functions have become so critical that suddenly having your phone die unexpectedly could actually place you in danger. Imagine if you were in an unfamiliar place (one without frequent taxis), late at night, trying to hail an Uber in exceptionally cold weather, and then your phone kicked the bucket. What would you do? This actually happened to one poster on reddit, who was fortunate enough to find a hotel where he or she was able to use a phone to call a friend (whose phone number they knew - how many people know each other's phone numbers these days?) to pick them up. What if your car broke down on a freezing night and you were unable to phone a tow company? Our world and infrastructure, and our very decision-making processes as humans, have started to evolve around the ubiquity of constant connection through our smartphones. Without them, we can be left feeling helpless. We'll be reaching out to Google about this to see if they have any comment.

Froggies I am living in tropical country and it still happens around 20%, fixed after replacing with new battery fatlantis Introducing forced obsolescence when planning isn't enough. Linh Feedback. It does work sometimes. maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/31ff0858463dce3005d122af1771be1674201f869957270e6de3b939a5bd5adf.png Happens to me Everytime I finish a run using mapmyfitness now. This morning my battery was a lil under 50%, and I go to save my workout, and it just flashes the battery saver screen and shuts down. The only way to get it to boot is to plug it in. It did this one other time when I was playing around with Google maps battery was around 40%. Hopefully Google can figure this crap out. jfbaudio I called Google while I was still under the 1 year warranty, they replaced it for me. The problem was creeping up, from shutdowns at 4%, then 7%, and so on to 20% when I had it replaced. It took about 2 months to get there. This was during the summer so cold weather didn't play into it. Scott Harris Haven't had this problem but last week I had problems with my phone freezing on me. Was forced to have to do the power + volume down button to turn it off. Left the Android beta and didn't restore any backups. Did that like 2 days ago and so far no freezes. Have already been considering switching to iPhone, but if this battery thing starts happening to my 6P then I'm done with Android. Matías Duarte 1-Get a Note 7 2-Wait until explodes 3-Warm your N6P with the Note flames 4-??? 5-Profit. melvin My dies at 15%. When I reboot. It's back 30%. Like wth. I assumed battery was shot. Rawhi Mohammad Sounds more and more like the iPhone.. this new Pixel strategy is getting crazier by the day. just_a_regular_citizen I have the problem with my 6P. It's been worse outside in the cold. I took a screenshot right after I plugged in and restarted. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5edefbc6313ef36d560ab07169dc6fa529e1d969dd6d2f0c6c2b43f8a7df673d.png ChuckDz3 This hit me very close to home! I was involved in a car accident over the weekend due to the icy road conditions in the midwest. In the middle of calling 911 for help my phone died. My battery was at 60% before I dialed the call. It was 8 degrees outside and almost stranded with no help. Luckily I was only 5 minutes away from my place and was able to walk home. This could have ended very different due to this issue! Robert A Lyon I have the issue, BUT it didn't originally begin at 7.0. Everything was okay until a couple weeks after the push out of 7.0, my whole phone went dark, no charge, wouldn't turn on, it was just a brick. It had restarted 3 times in a row, on the third restart just wouldn't do anything. Tried all the fixes recommended online. Sent back to Huwaii and on receipt back the phone turns on but the battery drain is present. Colder weather is worse and the battery goes dead anywhere from about 20% to 15% left to zero in a matter of a second or two. Battery saver mode comes on at 15% and it'll die on me. No problem before sending it in for the other power issue. Also get it back and the camera no longer focuses in close up. So in other words, I had no problem at the initial release of 7.0, it wasn't until the OEM got it and screwed it up. Adam C Just my speculation but I do not think any battery does well with rapid charging over the long term. I never charge my 6p with rapid charging and I still have great battery life on 7.0. for over a year. I wonder how may folks that have this issue uses rapid vs standard charging. Kid.Drunkadelic I kinda of feel bad to the guy I sold mine too then, I sold cause I thought Google was back to their old shit if not quality checking and dog flooding their code enough and my battery sucked. Sucked so bad I got a 6s plus now I see how much of dramatic change in battery life I now have. I might never come back Ernie So, is it hardware or software. Sounds like a hardware problem of sorts!!! Chris B Been having this issue for around a month as well. Shutoff is usually around 10-35% and seems worse in cool weather. onekage This happened to me today! Phone was left in cold car for few hours(16°F) , unlocked the device. Battery read 58% suddenly it powered off and would not come back on. Brought inside and put on charger 61% battery. This in not acceptable. I live in a freezing cold climate 7-8 months out of the year. I'm on 7.1.1. If this continues I'll be selling the phone or getting a replacement. Dakota Rickel So should I ask Google for a replacement or wait for more news about what the exact issue is and how they plan to fix it? MisterJ Sure the battery problem is an issue, but does it pose a material danger? I don't think so. Humans have lived without phones for millennia. If you are so dependent on your phone that you think you're gonna die without it, you need to rethink your life, and come up with different contingency plans that don't require a phone. With that said, i own a nexus 6p, and i have seen phone die at around 10 to 15%, but a few nights ago, i was able push the battery all the way down to 1%. Maybe being on the Android beta program has something to do with it? va_d1m How about this situation: - stayed out really late, about ~8.5km from the home for the first time in few years. - battery died at 25%, unable to get Uber (which has been our main form of cab service for a number of years for multiple reasons). - no cabs would take me home because "it's too short a fare during shift change-over time" which is illegal but happens all the time (Melbournians would understand), - walked home Sure, I did not feel in any danger and I know my city well but since we have become so reliant on our phones (and phone companies are complicit in commoditising smart phone ownership), when they break it causes severe inconvenience to our lives. Extrapolate that to being a tourist in a foreign country the outcome can be more than just inconvenient.. MisterJ Just think about what your parents' generation would have done. It's that simple. Brett Sewell I just went through three weeks of -20 weather with the update no issues but I certainly wouldn't trust my life to my phone either in a snowstorm Tom Z I had mine shut down at 38% once. Most of the time it's around 25% when it shuts down. It doesn't even get a chance to go into battery saver. I hope Google fixes this soon. Kyle Salewski Has been happening to me a TON in the past 2-3 weeks! I thought it was just me with a faulty battery. I do see it in very cold temps, it's been negative degrees or single digits here in Milwaukee quite a few days in the past few weeks.seems to be anything under 30 or 25% and then POOF!, dead. About a week ago I was getting an Uber and shut off after I requested it. Luckily I remembered the make and license of the car picking me up downtown. I would have been stuck out in the freezing snow without a phone. It happened Sunday night and again Monday night of this week. I did run the 7.1.1 update AFTER I charged it back up last night after it died. Hopefully this update changed something, but I'm not holding my breath. KingOfRedLions7 So this is common? Mine started doing this recently at around 25% and aside from that it also drained probably around twice as fast as it should have. Then I got a new battery replacement and the day after it died around 80% but I recalibrated the battery and it's been working good as new since then. If it really is the software accelerating hardware failure than I'm going to be pissed if it starts having problems again. :/ Cory Wilson Reading this on my 6p. Haven't noticed an issue yet and hopefully I won't. But I also thought I was immune to the g4 bootloop of death problem and then it happened and it sucked. psychomaniac189 did anybody email huawei and get a response? what was the response? mine was, Thank you for contacting Huawei Device USA. We're so sorry to hear about the battery issues you've been experiencing with your Nexus. Please guide to the following troubleshooting steps to attempt to correct the charging issue. If the steps are successful but you are still experiencing battery drainage, please contact us at 1-888-548-2934. 1. Plug your charger into the wall before plugging it into your phone. 2. Hold down the power button. 3. Without letting go of the power button, plug your phone into the charger. 4. Continue to hold the power button for another 20 seconds. The phone should begin to charge normally. Noam I have this issue too. I live in Israel, haven't noticed any connection to temperature. I hope they fix this, it's driving me mad! Wilson X Nearly 40% have this issue, voted by Chinese N6P users. https://plus.google.com/u/0/+WilsonX/posts/eS6ANzEMprR wadea This problem started very soon after I updated to 7.0. It also coincided with a trip I took to South Korea; the first time I ever traveled to a non-english country. My phone died without warning at 15% one night during my trip, and although I had a reasonable amount of information written down, I still ended up stranded due to the inability to access my phone, and being in a 'suburban' area of Seoul with very few services. So yah, it can be a safety issue. I'm aware of the problem now, so when I leave again for Korea in a month, for a year this time, I'm resolving the issue by replacing my phone. I can't be in a foreign country, and have an unreliable phone in my pocket. Morten Ulv I thought that it was related to me using the 60w chromebook pixel charger for the phone. Never died above like 12% and it has been a while since I had the problem. But possibly because I charge it in time... Fartknocker Had the problem once when I took the phone out of my pocket and put it in my center console while I was driving home. It was in the single digits that night. When I got it indoors, it worked fine again and the true, original battery amount came back. Gavin Dunsire I seem to be having this issue with my Pixel (not XL model).

Apparently, Huawei and Google just want to blame each other, while we users have to deal with the problem. Eoghan Murphy I'm seeing similar behaviour on my Moto G4 plus, and its not cold in Brisbane. Phone just shuts off randomly and when powered back on battery life is significantly reduced. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/706643efc8f98525f285b681ac3481677d6ca2c38c7c8b1620e5ca2f8e44e624.png Marc Westermann Seeing exactly the same issues since 7.0 on my Nexus 6P. The device shuts off when it hits the 15% threshold for the batterysaver. I contacted google multiple times for an RMA but they keep saying it's apps and that I should factory reset and not use apps for several days to confirm the issue. Eventually I got someone to send me the RMA link as I saw that they would charge you the full price of the nexus 6P if the returned device would be considered "flawless" in the eyes of the google support. I talked it through with the gouvernment customer care center here in germany and they said that this is unacceptable but there is nothing I can do at the moment. Worst service experience ever. Check out the screenshots, it's fun! /s https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da1b67aa1745daaa6c04379733cecb5d1423f4555bae8ddeaf1f9d66fa67b404.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/54e3430ee46793e40bc03539c9c2f72e32df6893bb5f5a742d95ff4ad887b533.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5f87b86e96716feb8fd4b94d202750630c0ddf98f297f357f9a095af4b962113.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6295d0e83ce0143d97df04c8bfdfc328bd9be95086bb09851f2385781f6a4d.jpg Stefano Miranda Hi. I am also here in Germany, but I have the big problem that my German is not really that good, so I was not able to find any Huawei customer center neither am I able to talk to the customer support in German. What makes it even more complicated is that I bought it on Amazon France, and I don't speak french either so I cannot complain with them. Please, if you have any information that may be relevant, send me a comment down below. I am even willing to pay for a new battery, this problem is really frustrating. Marc Westermann Wow, that's quiet a situation you got yourself into. As far as I can tell, there are Huawei shops in many major cities in Germany. There is also a support hotline from which I would assume that they talk at least basic english. But I think your best chance would be to contact Amazon in your origin country. I could imagine that they could help you as well. If not, I'd try Amazon France in english. Stefano Miranda I live in Munich but I did not see any Huawei shop here. do they also offer customer service in the shops? do you have a list? If I google for that I just find the Design Center here in Munich and not the Handy's shop LOL Marc Westermann Just search for them on google maps. I don't know if they offer customer service, but I'd assume that. It's pretty standard in germany for shops to also offer assistance on products. mchalakov What would you do? Hmmm I don't know .. WALK! Like all the 'poor' humans do where there is no Uber. And just change the battery... Josh They will never admit anything. They literally kept making us wait with ridiculous request after ridiculous request until finally the warranty expired for issues we had with bend gate and the glass popping out randomly with normal use. Google has purposely scammed a lot of people with this phone. Never will I ever purchase another Nexus or pixel product. Brian Michael Last week I gave up my Nexus 6p after battery drain issues and also when I upgraded to Nougat 7.1 my 6p kept bootlooping. So, I just bought a OnePlus 3T to hold me over. I am very pleased. I'll definitely think twice before buying another Google phone. Matt I am having issues with the battery, drops fast. And turns off randomly below 14% I did contact google, my device is less than 6 months old. They are replacing it for free. Aniket Vasishth I am glad that AP wrote an article on this.. at least now it will be taken seriously by Google Cenzo Great. The way this author writes, it won't be long before smartphones will be declared a necessity. paulmike3 For you, it might never be. For others, it is. Don't judge what you don't understand completely. Cenzo You obviously don't understand what basic human necessities are. paulmike3 I do. If we were talking about basic human necessities, I would agree with you. We're not. You said "necessity", which is a different classification. A car, a phone, electricity, heat, etc. are all necessities in my life (home, work). Without them, I would be in a critical safety situation, given the 12F temperature outside right now. The article remains spot on. Cenzo Corrected for context. Latheryin If you think it is then you have bigger issues then battery problems. There is nothing to understand. Might want to check anyone that thinks it is as they have some very big mental issues. Jonas Andersson Mine dies every night at about 15%. I have battery saver at 15% but the screen turns orange and about the same times it dies. Victory Hand I used to have this issue but 7.1.1 seems to have fixed it. Laird Rixford Mine always happens after using the camera. Even at 25%+. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bbea09d0194204d95339235943431ae6a221f8a4e195dc3a98d6a53a024fc310.png w https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8db3f5c513a96eafe8f20c1d778f421d2f4a7f072c60c59f588f59959ac515cd.png Russell I've had the same issue after updating my Pixel XL to 7.1.1. I contacted Google support and they said other users are experiencing the same issue. Hopefully a fix comes soon because my phone shuts off sometimes with just less than 50%!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/343c7bd4c50adb1781ede1d1bd3de748fb0b529b5ed87694d38ed96d8216c77f.png paulmike3 This is good info, thanks! If you haven't already, please post this on the Android bug report thread as well (and state that it's happening on your Pixel XL) -> https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=227849 Michael Hall This is a big fat joke. It is crap like this which makes the iPhone look more and more tempting. If I'm anywhere near 20% then open up a high drain app like Snapchat, it just dies. I love Google, but Christ they are useless. Andre Natale David, please stay on top of this. I thought I was alone In this issue but I am glad you made light of it. dblock The behavior of this is very strange, as it happens to me, but usually never above 30% battery remaining. It only happens to me when I use something that seems to be resource-intensive. I noticed that it mainly happens when I use my camera while the battery is below 30%, or something that utilizes the camera, like Snapchat. Otherwise it seems like I can drain my battery down to 0 if I don't use my camera. I have never seen it randomly shut off while using anything else, that I can recall anyhow. Still, I assume something like Uber might also cause this behavior, especially when you are awaiting a ride to show up and the ride tracker map is up, as that is probably somewhat resource-heavy. Either way, it is unacceptable. For me, this started happening as soon as I started using Nougat in general, not 7.1.1 specifically. Initially I thought it was just a result of custom ROMs, however now that Nougat is more widely available, it looks like that is not the case at all. Chris Babes This has really been effecting me greatly! Please fix. I'm at the point where I may have to get a new phone. I work outdoors in Ontario, Canada. So frustrating and dangerous. Robert Andersson Buy a Huawei. melvin my just did it at 37%.. so frustration. Alex O’Brien Same thing happens to me although I live in a warm climate (California) and, to the best of my recollection, has only happened once my battery is around 15%. It is definitely a safety issue. sodsavage Having this same issue, didn't know it was a widespread problem. Believe it or not, I was actually assaulted because of this issue affected a situation. RVCA It sounds like only a small amount of people are impacted. Haha Suckers!! Arman G This has actually happened to me recently. It was like -10C, phone had a 50% charge left and died on me, just as my Uber driver went past me. So I missed the Uber and the ability to get to my destination in time. I had to rely on m my work iPhone the rest of the night. See the screenshot of the battery meter. No explanation for the sharp power dip. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cf7a5e1479a23d65e57b6cd424f788820e14c622977f8b62b35cbeaecce7211a.png Ger PG I live in the not-so-cold weathers of Mediterranean Europe but yesterday I spent a whole day in Prague at -5 ºC and my phone kept dying at 35%. Later at night I saw this article in Android Police describing this issue and I felt like you were explaining my day. I spent 550€ on this phone 6 months ago, so they'd better be fixing this soon. By the way, I am still running Android 6.0.1, so add this build to the list of affected ones. jobber99 this happened to me starting in september, i was on 7.0 i believe--would get to 15% and then down to 0. i called google store support, and they replaced my 6p. it is now also happening to my wife's phone, on 7.1.1, but it's too late i think for her to call google store support as the phone is > 1 year old now Kelly This happens to me. The first time I was out of town (and the phone was a month old) so it was extra scary. I didn't know this is what was happening but now that you describe it, it fits. I pull my phone out of my purse and it won't cut on. I have to plug it in and wait for at least 30 seconds before the power button will turn it back on. It does not show the battery charging icon either, so it looks bricked. Scary!!! It's happened twice. I also notice it shutting down and/or restarting itself all the time but I think that's the stupid button sensitivity. Kelly Oh and this was way before 7.0 (it was August this year) and was indoors in a moderate climate. staticx57 I've had mine shut down numerous times at around 30% and this was on MM Chris This actually just happened to me. I was inside, sitting at 60% battery, when my phone just powers off with the low battery warning. Thinking it was just a normal crash, I reboot it and went to to plug it on the charger anyway, it fully booted (off the charger) but then showed 2% battery remaining. I looked at the battery history, it has been running for 3 hours and was somewhere around 60-65% when it literally dropped to zero. And I hadn't barely used my phone except at the very start of the day. Didn't realize it was a widespread issue, also only happened once. ( My phone usually powers off at about 10% normally, I just assumed that was within the margin of error for battery prediction) Patrick Murphy Yep mine has been doing it since it got cold in upstate New York usually 30% or lower plus since Android 7.0 dropped seemed worse Fernando Pena Never happened to me after a full year of use... Martial Clausse Was waiting the train on the platform, in the cold, phone shut down at 30%. Tried turning it on again, as soon as boot animation finished it shut down again. Once in the train, I charged it a little, and it booted up with 29% battery. Kashif Sheikh After the most recent update, my Nexus 5x went into an unfixable bootloop, which apparently is a very common issue. Not sure if this is some joint hardware/software issue, but it seems to have been triggered after a software update: http://www.techtimes.com/articles/186940/20161125/lg-cant-fix-nexus-5x-bootloop-issue-so-its-offering-full-refunds.htm MarkM Thank you for reporting on this. My 6P shut down in 20 degree temps with 55% battery left while hiking in the wilderness. I was not able to restart until it was plugged into a charger. This is definitely a safety issue that Google needs to address as soon as possible. MarkM check it out: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1ebf53c40e7e86db227443e8b655467e6a662ebae3bc6fdd181894458458ed3c.jpg Luxferro Hopefully you posted this on the Google issue tracker as well. Scott Kennedy Hah. I literally just had Google agree to an out-of-warranty replacement for this issue. I was expecting them to say no (I just needed documentation they wouldn't cover it), but the replacement arrived today. It'll make a nice gift for someone. Mine happened around 35%, indoors. Nothing to do with cold weather. Xu Mengran i am glad that people are paying attention to this. It has been keeping happening to me. the phone usually shuts off around 25% and needs to be connected to the socket otherwise cannot be turned on!!!! tibor ric Same on my Nexus 6p. Battery is dropping mast faster than when the phone was new... 3223 So much for fast updates while being half baked. Maybe oem's holding off updating their phones to rectify internal coding errors seems like a much better option than getting the fastest updates first and having these things happen.. Luke I usually don't comment, but articles like these are very important. So many issues that only occur after a certain time (especially once you're out of warranty) get swept under the rug and companies don't pay the price for making devices that don't last. I also find it worrying after reading some of the comments here, people with this issue actually consider solving the problem by buying a Pixel. Seriously guys, vote with your dollars and don't empower companies that treat you like shit. Let's hope Google can fix this. Luxferro Can we get this pinned at the top of the site until Google fixes it? If this gets no more press Google will take their sweet time fixing it, if at all. Rob Paek My 6P hasn't been shutting down but I feel like since the second to last update (I'm in the beta program) my battery life on standby is abysmal. Plus the emojis I send don't show up in the Messenger texting app (Google's, not Facebook). Brownstar No issues with mine tibor ric Living in Sweden. It was only 5°C outside... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8a00b2758b995826cf17b5f6a2c2eaee41230b56d9d301402f3ceba8f67f6c7e.png Matt Virus My 6p on marshmallow does this all the time...Sometimes at 20 or 25%....But yesterday I was doing outside work in the cold and my phone died at over 50%. Insp_Gadget Happens to me, regardless of the temperature. Happened this morning at 45% and I was indoors (hadn't been outside) for over 12 hours. imdevu Started happening on my 6P from yesterday. And suddenly it is a nightmare. Especially since 6P is my primary device (and the only one I carry) Robert Andersson Google is implementing the iPhone feature where batteries die at 30 %. Ricardo Torres My nexus 6p recently started showing this problem. Jon E. This happened to me last week while driving in my cold car during below-freezing temperatures outside. It was connected to the USB-C car charger and running Google Maps Navigation. It had around 50% battery and it randomly shut itself off, did not come back on by itself. I had to dangerously pull over while the sleet/ice was getting worse with the freezing wind, and when I turned it back on, it came on and then immediately turned itself off again. I literally SAT on my damn phone for 7-10 mins until it warmed up, then it booted up okay, but it showed 13% battery for some reason...I've been worried about it, and now here I am seeing this is a widespread issue; wonderful. Shay Carmel The issue is not because of cold environment. I live in Israel where it's 23 degrees or more and it happend to me as well, battery drain and shuts down at 16 percent. Ceridwen I've had it happen with up to 38% battery life remaining on mine. Seems to occur most often when the phone is even marginally cold (30 degree weather, phone in coat pocket) and I activate the camera. Made my husband quite angry with me once for not telling him my phone was low before it died while I was at the park with our daughter. Rather frustrated at this point because I've already RMA'd the phone twice for rebooting issues where it would refuse to turn back on for hours at a time. Not impressed with quality control for this device. Diwa Galvez Does the issue persists in 7.1.1? Mine is still on Marshmallow, and I've been holding out on the upgrade. weictay My 6P was just upgraded to 7.1.1 a few days ago and yesterday, I noticed my phone had shut down at 25% battery life. Never had this happened before while it was 7.0 so this was a surprise. Stephen Cornwell Happened to me today: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e10378fd3532e7e6b183e2085e162a4bf1f2e8b7307c1854d33caf1a2dcb1faa.png Left on the side of the road in -2°C because my phone died and I couldn't call to be picked up. Running 7.1.1 so it's obviously not fixed yet. Gerardo Sarabia I broke my pixel so while fixing it decided to use my Nexus 6p. Is dying at about 33%. Ridiculous. Any news on this? Trevor I was at 75% and this just happened as I was playing with my dog outside (I live in Canada so it is cold) and the phone just dies! I just got the phone 4 months ago too. Andrey I have the same problem. Was snowboarding at Stevens Pass in WA and just ten minutes after I hit the slopes the phone died at 40% battery. The temperature outside was 15F. Basically phone renders useless in mellow cold weather. Any updates on the fix? EastOakland510 Same thing is happening to my phone too usually after 20% Alexander Gontar Any feedback from Google or Huawei on this article? Tom Frascone (theorie) Just recently developed this problem on my Nexus 6P purchased in Jan 2016. Currently running 7.1.1 and when my battery hits 20% it divebombs to around 10% before automatically shutting off. It's winter, but I live in Florida and it's been around 70F the past month...so not sure temp is an issue. Just called Google and they said my phone is still in warranty (by only a few days) and they are going to replace it. eastprecinctguy That just happened to me tonight. Out of the country, late at night, trying to get back to the hotel, cold out - phone dies with plenty of battery life. Won't turn back on. Thank God I brought my portable charger. Not good. TrOpAzR So I just spent the last 40 minutes with Google Chat Support regarding this issue. I was the owner of a launch device and had zero issues with this phone until 7.1.1. 3-4 weeks ago my phone started shutting off between 5-10% battery. I took multiple screenshots and submitted them to Google Support. They pointed me to a list of 30 different things that I should do for "optimal" use but eventually RMA'd the device after the problem persisted even after a full wipe and reflash of the latest system images. I received my replacement device today and let it hang out on 7.0 which is what it shipped with. Battery acted completely normal and the phone was behaving really well. Had a persistent notification to upgrade to 7.1.1 and reluctantly accepted. Phone lasted about 15 minutes off the charger before it died near 25-30% battery. Attached is the screenshot. This is absolutely unacceptable. I have since been back in contact with Google Chat Support and they've promised to escalate this to a "specialist". Before I RMA'd my original device I asked them if this would continue to be a problem. They assured me that the refurbished replacement would be "tested to the highest standards" and that I would have nothing to worry about. Literally less than 3 hours after receiving the replacement device the problem is even worse than it was with my original device. Since it was on 7.0 when I received it they obviously didn't even test the replacement with the 7.1.1 update to ensure there were no issues with the software.. Simple deduction leads me to believe that this is absolutely a problem with 7.1.1. The 7.1.1 software update is obviously borking SOMETHING on this device. In addition, my old device suffered from the "echo" problem on phone calls for multiple months. However, I refused to believe there was an issue and would always tell the other person it was THEIR phone. Found out real quick that I was incorrect when I saw the thread about this issue here on XDA.. Sure, the phones aren't exploding like the Note 7.....but Google has a serious issue on their hands that they must address quickly. Unfortunately, I don't think they will. We must demand that this problem is fixed....and fixed soon. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eca7a15aad8a3b2a76adcefdd9d963140ea4355aa44d05663207124c0ac04e.png Ray My phone used to die around 5% when I used to take walks in the park. I thought it might have just been an issue with the phone not having enough energy to handle the gps, so I ignored it. Yesterday I was waiting for an Uber and I saw my driver go past me on the map. He called me, and right after I tried to speak the phone shut off completely. I had about 34% battery but couldn't turn the phone back on. I'm lucky he didn't just give up and go home or it would have been a major inconvenience. I owned two Nexus 6 phones and both had a similar issue as well. With the 6 there was some over heating that I think caused the issue, but back when I had a Galaxy S3 I had bad overheating and the battery never behaved like that. I feel like since they introduced all of this rapid charging technology these smartphone batteries are starting to fail quicker. Shaik Shahir I don't have the battery issue most of the time , but I think it's related to cold , becuz whenever I keep my AC on it gets damn cold inside the room and at that time my phone shuts down but when it's not cold it works perfectly . Israel Rodriguez I just went from loving my Nexus the first year after release and as soon as that update rolled out I just have grown to hate my phone I once loved. Such a shame Google is hiding from this waiting for things to blow over. I wish they do a recall or something to get it fixed otherwise this is the worst investment I've ever made Stephen Metz-Lago Same thing. Take a picture or video in cold weather and game over, even with over 50% charge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8faa6cbe1d087a3b07ba213803feed31f0f32c80e9e7220d48ad30a8b5ea1ef.png Ching-Wang Hung Thanks for reporting this but were you able to get comments from Google on this issue yet? Huawei customer support keeps saying it's a software issue and refused to provide any repairs or replacements even though my phone is still within warranty. I'm really disappointed in them and will never buy their products again. Richard Y I would always tell everyone the biggest draw of this phone is now for once, I never had to think about battery life, ever. How fast things change. Those who feel it's Nougat or the weather are mistaken. These problems started occuring when the Pixel was released - Google made sure the Nexus 6P had problems a) to get nexus owners to jump ship go Pixel and b) any bad publicity on the Nexus would ensure there would be no debate as to whether someone had to decide between the 6P and a Pixel. Weh Yeoh This issue is online in a few blogs, it's also on Google's issue tracker but as a low priority, (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=227849) which is poor form. It doesn't seem like Huawei are taking it seriously either. This issue has been unresolved for me since October. I think it's time to step it up so I've just purchased two domains, googledoesntlisten.com and huaweidoesntlisten.com. One might be able to redirect to the other. My idea is that we can post screenshots of our battery issues, our locations, and maybe a one sentence line like "I was stuck in the snow when my phone's GPS shut down" to hammer home the reality of the issue here. This might get Google and Huawei to do something, especially since it's affecting a lot of people. Problem is, I'm very poor on website design. Now that i have purchased the domains, who is willing to help me get them set up? roseskegg It happens to me all the time, and I live in the Bay Area! It's never below 45 degrees, but my phone just shut off today at 40% Tomasimpo I have been suffering from early battery shutoffs for the past month or so. Finally having had enough of waiting for Google to release a software fix for this issue I called the UK Google support and CSR immediately said it was an known issue affecting a very small number of handsets. I asked for a new handset and they said yes immediately. I now have a brand new 6p on 7.1.1 without the issue. My handset was purchased at launch from the Google Store so was over 12 months old so was expecting a fight for a new handset. Anyone in the UK who got their handset direct from Google I suggest you phone them and get yourselves an shiny new 6p. TBolt My Nexus 6P died the other day at around 20% battery life (I'm in warm Orange County, California). I started googling the issue to see if there have been any known fixes for the problem -- sadly nothing from Google or Huawei. Very disappointing for Google Android & Huawei. Justin Alick Have had this problem since December 2016, with shutdowns (and inability to restart until charging) guaranteed between 15-20% and once at 50%. This has been hugely disruptive to my professional and personal life - I recently swapped from Samsung to Google's native phones and will move on if the company doesn't fix this problem soon. Akabari I know this old but I wanted to point out this happens to me a lot, and I once had to walk 4 miles in below zero temps and stay at a hotel because of it Ricardo N Feliciano It may not be effective, but I've made a Change.org petition for this issue (and the bootloop issue as well): https://www.change.org/p/google-support-acknowledge-nexus-6p-issues Phillip Mwaniki I bought a nexus 6p a month ago and it still has this issue. Can't trust google anymore. Qadir Ali khan problem not with the device problem is with android N factory image. even I am also facing this problem when first I upgrade to android N 7.0 and problem is continues until I decide to step to custom rom . now I am on Pure Nexus rom android 7.1.1 and phone performance is awesome with a great battery life without any issue . Ricardo N Feliciano I made a petition for this problem: https://www.change.org/p/google-support-acknowledge-nexus-6p-issues Margaritas Ante Porcos This happened to my 6p now after 7.1.2 update. I am beyond furious with Google. Josh Temperature may affect it, but it's a correlation only... not the cause. It's definitely a hardware problem, but it was brought out with Nougat. We have two Nexus 6Ps. One is on Sprint (CDMA) and one is on AT&T (GSM). The Sprint one does have the problem and the AT&T one does not (regardless of temperature). Google sent me a free replacement for the Sprint one (outside of my warranty I might add because they seem to know that it is some form a hardware issue). The new phone didn't have the problem for the first few days of testing it just on Wifi. But the first day I put in the Sprint sim card and activated service, it started the bug again... this time it was actually worse (before it would die at 20-30%; this one dies at 40%). So it may be a CDMA radio problem that causes some glitch in battery level reporting with Nougat. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 142k 105k Latest Deals 26 [Update: Added some more] Deal Alert: Here are some more temporarily free apps and games for your Sunday 2017/04/09 3:05pm PDTApr 9, 2017 26 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Gen LTE for $179.99 ($220 off) on eBay 2017/04/08 7:15pm PDTApr 8, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] 4-pack Type C to MicroUSB adapters $4.95 at Amazon w/Slickdeals code ($3 off MSRP) 2017/04/07 1:02pm PDTApr 7, 2017 11 [Deal Alert] JBL Flip 3 on sale at $64 ($36 off MSRP) as an Amazon Gold Box daily deal 2017/04/07 12:12pm PDTApr 7, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Snag an Arlo Pro 3-pack from Amazon for $500 ($80 off) 2017/04/06 7:07pm PDTApr 6, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Independent Online Desk It's been long rumoured that Google will use YouTube to introduce a live TV service. The company has now confirmed those suspicions. Google officially launched its entry into the streaming of live TV, with YouTube TV. It lets you access live and recorded content from major networks typically found on cable. It is available alongside YouTube's existing content, and it works on practically every screen you can watch YouTube on, but it only costs $35 a month without a contract. Here's everything you need to know about it, reports pocket-lint.     What is Android TV, how does it work, and which devices offer it?     Which is the best movie streaming box for under £150?     Android TV vs Samsung Tizen vs Firefox OS vs LG webOS What is YouTube TV? When people watch TV, they tune into live sports, breaking news, sitcoms, dramas, and a number of other different types of programmes. Although there is a tonne of content to choose from, there are limitations to how you can watch it. You simply can't watch TV when you want and on any screen without a contract. And you certainly don't always have access to fancy TV features such as DVR. YouTube TV is attempting to change that. It is described as "live TV designed for the YouTube generation - those who want to watch what they want, when they want, how they want, without commitments." What channels are on YouTube TV? Google said the initial lineup of "more than 40 networks" includes CBS, Fox, NBC, and CBS, as well as cable players USA and FX. There's a total of 10 sports networks available, including ESPN, Fox Sports, and NBCSN. Local affiliates will also be included, so you can watch news from the same channels you'd normally get over the air. You can even add Showtime for an additional price.     Which is the best movie streaming service in the UK? It's safe to say YouTube TV directly competes with existing services such as Sling TV and PlayStation Vue, both of which offer access to live TV from major networks, cable players, and sports networks. But there are some holes - like Viacom, Discovery, A&E, AMC, and Turner (with TBS and TNT). Sony's $35 plan for PlayStation Vue offers many of these networks and more, such as CNN. You can see the full YouTube TV channel lineup above. There's also a couple add-on packages you can buy at launch: Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month). Unlimited cloud DVR storage Apart from live TV from major networks, YouTube TV includes unlimited cloud DVR storage. With that feature, you can even add a show or sports team to your favourites, and it'll automatically save them for you. Your cloud DVR records as many shows as you want, simultaneously, without using data or space on your phone (though you can stream recordings from any device at any time). Google said it stores each of your recordings for nine months. And, yes, you can fast forward or rewind DVR content, so you can quickly pass right over all those annoying commercials. Available across all your screens YouTube TV works on both Android and iOS. That means you can watch YouTube TV on your phone, tablet, or computer. You can also stream to your TV with a Google Chromecast or Chromecast built-in TV. YouTube TV will even eventually work with Google Home, too, allowing you to ask Home to play a show on your Chromecast. Google said it'll "just work," according to Engadget. How does YouTube TV work?

Now that YouTube TV has launched, you can access it from the new YouTube TV app for Android and iOS or from the web on your computer. Other devices (like Apple TV, Roku, the PS4, and Xbox One) don't have access to the new YouTube TV app at launch. However, the mobile app has a "cast" button available at the top throughout, so you can throw a video to your Chromecast or a compatible TV. The mobile app features just three main screens: live, library and home. But it also has universal search (located at the top; can be accessed from most screens), allowing you to search for content by genre, network, and categories. You can search for something like "dogs" and get a list of programmes that feature dogs. If you choose to search a series, you will see a page with all the episodes. Live Live shows what is currently being broadcasted by networks, with live previews of what's on each channel. Just tap to start playing. To record something to watch later, you can tap a plus icon on the preview. When watching in portrait mode, you'll see recommendations at the bottom, or you can flip the phone to landscape to enter full screen. It's worth noting that because of Verizon's deal with the NFL, you can't watch NFL games on your phone. You'll be able to stream them on the desktop or a TV, but not on your mobile device. Library Library shows everything you've recorded and everything scheduled to be recorded on your DVR. Home Home is kind of like what you see on YouTube. It'll show what you've watched recently, as well as recommendations based on what you've watched so far, and you'll see things you may have stopped and might want to continue playing.

This is a separate product from YouTube Red, a service Google launched in 2015 as a way to give you an ad-free YouTube experience. YouTube Red does feature some original programming, but with a YouTube TV membership, you can watch YouTube Red Original series and movies via the new YouTube TV app. But, unfortunately, you won't get the full ad-free YouTube experience. YouTube TV is now live: What is it, which channels does it offer, and how does it work? Independent Online Desk Its been long rumoured that Google will use YouTube to introduce a live TV service. The company has now confirmed those suspicions. Google officially launched its entry into the streaming of live TV, with YouTube TV. It lets you access live and recorded content from major networks typically found on cable. It is available alongside YouTubes existing content, and it works on practically every screen you can watch YouTube on, but it only costs $35 a month without a contract.

Work done at Google Brain is drawing interest among those watching for signs of progress in machine translation. New Scientist said, "Google's latest take on machine translation could make it easier for people to communicate with those speaking a different language, by translating speech directly into text in a language they understand." Machine translation of speech normally works by converting it to text, then translating that into text in another language. Any error in speech recognition will lead to an error in transcription and a mistake in the translation, the report added. The Google Brain team cut out the middle step. "By skipping transcription, the approach could potentially allow for more accurate and quicker translations." The researchers have authored a paper, Sequence-to-Sequence Models Can Directly Transcribe Foreign Speech" and it is on arXiv. Authors are Ron Weiss, Jan Chorowski, Navdeep Jaitly, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen. The authors in their paper described their approach involving an encoder-decoder deep neural network architecture that directly translates speech in one language into text in another. "We present a model that directly translates speech into text in a different language. One of its striking characteristics is that its architecture is essentially the same as that of an attention-based ASR neural system." ASR stands for automatic speech recognition. What did the authors do for testing? Matt Reynolds in New Scientist: "The team trained its system on hundreds of hours of Spanish audio with corresponding English text. In each case, it used several layers of neural networks – computer systems loosely modelled on the human brain – to match sections of the spoken Spanish with the written translation." Reynolds said they analyzed the waveform of the Spanish audio to learn which parts seemed to correspond with which chunks of written English. "When it was then asked to translate, each neural layer used this knowledge to manipulate the audio waveform until it was turned into the corresponding section of written English." Results? The team reported 'state-of-the-art performance' on the conversational Spanish to English speech translation tasks, said The Stack. The model could outperform cascades of speech recognition and machine translation technologies. The team used the BLEU score, which judges machine translations based on how close they are to that by a professional human. BLEU stands for bilingual evaluation understudy. According to Slator, "BLEU has become the de facto standard in evaluating machine translation output." Using BLEU, the proposed system recorded 1.8 points over other translation models, said The Stack. "It learns to find patterns of correspondence between the waveforms in the source language and the written text," said Dzmitry Bahdanau at the University of Montreal in Canada (who wasn't involved with the work), quoted in New Scientist. Moving forward, the authors in their paper wrote that "An interesting extension would be to construct a multilingual speech translation system following in which a single decoder is shared across multiple languages, passing a discrete input token into the network to select the desired output language." In other words, as Reynolds said in New Scientist, "The Google Brain researchers suggest the new speech-to-text approach may also be able to produce a system that can translate multiple languages."         LATEST STORIES (9) Syrian Air Forces' Su-22s Take off from Shayrat Air Base to Target Terrorists in Homs US: Antifa Protesters and White Nationalists Face-Off at Rally against Trump's Syria Strike Syria: Victims Treated Following Homs Car Bomb Attack Iraqi Forces Recapture New District in Western Mosul from ISIL Worldwide Protest against Trump's Missile Strike in Syria Syria: Scores Rally outside UN Office in Damascus to Condemn US Missile Strike on Shayrat Airbase Syria: 2,500 Militants Leave Homs as Part of Evacuation Deal Syria: More Gunmen, Family Members Leave Al-Wa'er District in Homs Bombings at Churches in Egypt Leave at Least 37 Dead Dragging US into Another Quagmire: Trump Declares Official Support for Terrorism in Syria Iranian Leader Calls US Missile Strikes on Syria as "Strategic Mistake" Syria-Iran-Russia Joint Operations Room Warns of Crushing Response to Any Further US Attack Terrorists' Main Position Destroyed in Syrian Army Attack in Hama, Several Militants Killed Iran to Buy Russian-Made Amphibious Planes 228 Iranian Lawmakers Condemn US Missile Strikes on Syria Syrian Air Forces' Su-22s Take off from Shayrat Air Base to Target Terrorists in Homs TEHRAN (FNA)- Drone footage shows Su-22 warplanes belonging to the Syria air force taking off from Shayrat air base in Homs to target terrorists' positions in the province.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense.

Here are eight scientific instruments your phone is capable of transforming into. 1. Earthquake detector (MyShake) This will be especially useful to any of you living near a fault. MyShake can detect seismic activity using nothing but your Android phone. The app's special algorithm picks out an earthquake shake from other types of movement. If enough people install it, the University of California, Berkeley team that created it hopes to use it as an impromptu early earthquake warning system as well. An iPhone version is apparently in the works but not ready yet. 2. Spirit level (Google/iOS) Your smartphone comes equipped with an gyroscope that knows how flat or tilted the device is. Several apps can easily take advantage of that, the easiest of which is built directly into Google: try typing "bubble level" into the Google search bar on Android or iOS to bring up simple level tool. There are plenty of dedicated apps you can use instead, not least the one built into iOS. Launch the Compass app and swipe to the right to find the spirit level. (You may be asked to calibrate your iPhone before it works.) 3. Skin cancer scanner (MoleScope and SkinVision) Using a bulky camera lens clip and an Android or iOS app, MoleScope lets you examine skin moles exactly, just as its name suggests. The app scans and tracks suspicious moles on your body and guides you through a self-diagnosis process. You can also send off scans to a qualified dermatologist. If you want to stick to an app without an accessory, then SkinVision is available for Android and iOS devices and promises just as high a level of accuracy. 4. Heart rate monitor (Instant Heart Rate) Plenty of wearables — from wristbands to chest straps — can monitor your heart rate, but you can do it with your phone too if you have a suitable app installed. Instant Heart Rate, available on Android and iOS, is one of the best. It works by scanning the changing colour of your fingertip through your phone's camera and working out your current heart rate accordingly. It's not the most elegant solution, but it works — and with no additional hardware. 5. Microscope (Micro Phone Lens) Born on Kickstarter, the Micro Phone Lens gives your smartphone's camera a whopping 150x magnification boost, allowing you to use it as a portable microscope (it works best when used with samples on microscopic slides). The small accessory you stick to your phone's camera lens can apparently function with any camera rated as 5 megapixels or higher. If you just want the adhesive-free lens itself without any accessories, prices start at $US30 ($40). 6. Sound level meter (Decibel Meter Pro) Apps like Decibel Meter Pro ($US1 ($1) for iOS) use your smartphone's microphone to turn your handset into a sound level meter — though accuracy may vary depending on the quality of your handset. Those of you on Android might want to try the free Sound Meter instead. There are several other alternatives to experiment with. Useful for reporting the neighbours for being too loud late at night, at least. 7. Thermometer (Thermodo) It's likely that your phone already has thermometers inside it, but ones designed to measure internal component temperatures. To get an accurate reading on the air around you, you need an external sensor like Thermodo. It plugs into the headphone jack on your Android handset or iPhone and then works in tandem with the companion app to tell you exactly how hot or cold it is in your current location. The cheapest Thermodo sells for $US30 ($40). 8. Baseball speed detector (Radar) This one is only "coming soon", but it's still worth mentioning: the successfully Kickstartered Scoutee combines an app and a small detector device, giving you an on-the-go speed radar for measuring pitching speed. The kit lets you log speeds and record videos, save and analyse pitch parameters and game results, and of course share stats with the wider world. If you missed the crowdfunding campaign, the pre-order price is $US170 ($228). Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

Experts have since said amputations may have been wrongly blamed on a spider bite, and authorities now consider a bacterial infection to be responsible for the man’s injuries. Despite this, the damage to the largely harmless white-tail may have been done.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch.

Sign up for our weekly email * By John Gray         Print HTML “Dead of the world, unite!” Appearing in a manifesto published in Petrograd in 1920, this arresting slogan encapsulated the philosophy of cosmism, which promoted interplanetary exploration as a path to immortality. Mixing scientific futurism with ideas derived from the 19th-century Russian Orthodox mystic Nikolai Fedorov, cosmism was summed up by the rocket engineer Konstantin ­Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935) as “the perfection of man and the liquidation of all imperfect forms of life”. Liberated from the Earth, human beings would become pure ether, bodiless and undying. The belief that death could be conquered by science was embraced by a renegade section of the Bolshevik intelligentsia, including Maxim Gorky, and informed the decision to immortalise Lenin’s cadaver – first by refrigeration, in an early experiment in what would later be called “cryonic suspension”, and then by embalming when freezing failed. Cosmist thinking went on to find a home in the Soviet space programme and continues to influence Russian science to this day. Nearly a century after the cosmist manifesto, a group of transhumanists gathered outside Google’s corporate headquarters in Mountain View, California, carrying placards reading “Immortality now!” and “Google, please, solve death”. Death could be solved, the group believed, by the development of “cyber-consciousness” – a task requiring new technologies for uploading the contents of the human brain into cyberspace, which the group called on the tech company to fund. Google was already investing substantial resources in life-extension techniques and, in 2012, the company hired Ray Kurzweil, long associated with programmes aiming to achieve immortality through cryonic suspension, artificial intelligence and mind uploading, as its director of engineering. History continues by being forgotten. Mark O’Connell, in recalling the February 2014 demonstration outside Google HQ, reported as “the first ever transhumanist street action in the US”, says little about the longer antecedents of contemporary trans­humanism in his engaging and at times very funny book. This is an exploration of our time, conducted by an observer who is very much of our time. O’Connell presents the reader with a gallery of diverting characters, including an Oxford-educated “extropian” philosopher who goes by the name of Max More, who aims to achieve “more life, more intelligence, more freedom” by replacing the human body with a robot controlled by an uploaded mind, and Zoltan Istvan, the transhumanist candidate for the US presidency in 2016, who conducted his campaign from an “immortality bus” decked out as a coffin. The weird mixture of science and religion that typifies much of contemporary culture is illustrated in questing, faintly sad figures who blend transhumanist “anti-deathism” with Buddhism, Mormonism, Wicca or the UFO cult Raëlism, whose members believe the human species was created by aliens. We learn of the LSD guru Timothy Leary’s late-life engagement with transhumanism, which included membership of the cryonic suspension organisation Alcor, and that when the time came for him to have his body frozen, he opted instead to have “his cremated ashes shot into space from a cannon”. O’Connell reports that Leary’s last act “is still a sore point within the cryonics community”, which views his “capitulation to deathism” as “a significant tragedy”. O’Connell’s impressions of the lost souls who have drifted into transhumanism are vivid and memorable. Yet he sees them from a distance that is never explained. Like many of the people he interviews, he seems to think that a report of his feelings is all that is needed to validate his beliefs and his doubts. He cites transhumanists expressing disgust with the process of ageing, in themselves and in others, and he tells us that he is not a transhumanist. But he never gives any reasons why he rejects their attitudes, nor does he offer an alternative view of his own. The book is a succession of vignettes in which fundamental questions about the transhumanist enterprise are not explored. If the bodies of the followers of the cult are retrieved from their icy tombs, will the dead be reborn, or will what emerges be clones of human beings who had died for ever? Is information uploaded from the brain into cyberspace the essence of the human mind, or only a dim ghost of a mind that no longer exists? Is being embodied an accidental feature of the mind, or an integral part of what it means to be human? Discussing “A Letter to Mother Nature”, a transhumanist manifesto in which Max More sets out his proposals for amending the human species, O’Connell summarises the author’s proposals:   We would no longer consent to live under the tyranny of ageing and death, but would use the tools of biotechnology to “endow ourselves with enduring vitality and remove our expiration date”. We would augment our powers of perception and cognition through technological enhancements of our sense organs and our neural capacities. We would no longer submit to being the products of blind evolution . . . And we would no longer be content to limit our physical, intellectual and emotional capacities by remaining confined to carbon-based biological forms.   O’Connell writes that the letter captured “something crucial about what made the movement so strange and compelling to me – it was direct, and audacious, and it pushed the project of Enlightenment humanism to such radical extremes . . . There was, I felt, a whiff of madness about the whole enterprise, but it was a madness that revealed something fundamental about what we thought of as reason.” As a description of the simple-minded devotion of transhumanists to an unexamined idea of reason, this is well observed. But what is the “something fundamental” that the author has learned? He considers the possibility that transhumanism is a displaced passion for miracle and mystery, citing D H Lawrence: “Today man gets his sense of the miraculous from science and machinery, radio, airplanes, vast ships, zeppelins, poison gas, artificial silk: these things nourish man’s sense of the miraculous as magic did in the past.” But if Lawrence’s observation is well founded (as I think), what follows for the idea that human beings are or could ever be rational animals? These are questions that O’Connell does not ask, or leaves hanging in the air. Read as a kind of travelogue, To Be a Machine contains much that is interesting and entertaining. O’Connell perceptively observes how transhumanism fits with Silicon Valley’s world-view. He describes a conference at Google HQ, attended by the billionaire entrepreneurs Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, which brought together those who want to liberate themselves from death and exponents of “effective altruism”, who aim to improve the world by using reason. There are some intriguing crossovers between the two movements. Philosophically speaking, effective altruism is not much more than a reheated version of Jeremy Bentham’s utilitarianism. The early-19th-century thinker wanted to supplant ethical reasoning as it had been practised in the past with what he called “moral arithmetic” – a type of calculation aiming at maximising pleasure, happiness or want-satisfaction (there are many variations). Implying that every moral quandary has a rational solution, this is a project that fits well with the transhumanist belief that the evils of human life are, in essence, technical difficulties. The idea that moral reasoning should be a type of calculation seems to have influenced Thiel and Musk when they donated to research on the risks of artificial intelligence. Some of those who attended the conference (including the Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom, a former transhumanist who has become critical of the movement) believed that AI could even pose a risk to human survival. A super-intelligent machine could be programmed to serve human beings. But, as Bostrom, Stephen Hawking and others have pointed out, such a machine might slip free from its programming and begin to pursue ends of its own that have nothing to do with human well-being. Such an artificial super-intelligence need not be hostile to humans; it could simply be indifferent to whether humankind survives or not. Investing large sums into research that might prevent the disappearance of humankind might seem the most rational way of allocating resources – more so than spending money helping people deal with disability, for instance. But why is reducing a hypothetical risk to the species more rational than increasing the happiness of living human beings? Utilitarian moral arithmetic prompts this question along with many others in ethics. Both transhumanism and effective altruism claim to be rationalist philosophies and the two movements have offices in the same building in Oxford. But, like effective altruism, transhumanism is not as rational as it seems. Transhumanists believe that we are in essence sparks of consciousness which can escape mortality by detaching themselves from the decaying flesh in which they happen to be embodied. Deriving from mystical philosophies such as Platonism and gnosticism, it is an idea at odds with scientific materialism. For a genuine materialist – say, the ancient Roman poet-philosopher Lucretius – there can be no question of the human mind severing its linkage with the material world. The mind is material and dies when the body dies. Transhumanists will reply that technologies not available in Lucretius’s time will allow the mind to be uploaded into cyberspace. Yet it is unclear whether what will be uploaded will be a conscious mind, or just a spectral app spun off from the contents of the brain. Even if consciousness can be detached from the human body, the mind will still require a substratum of matter. The rejuvenated cadavers that emerge from cryonic suspension will be physical things, as will the cyborgs to which some transhumanists imagine their minds being transferred. Minds floating in cyberspace would not escape this dependency. Cyberspace is an artefact of physical objects – computers and the networked facilities they need – not an ontologically separate reality. If the material basis of cyberspace were destroyed or severely disrupted, any minds that had been uploaded would be snuffed out. Every technology requires a physical infrastructure in order to operate. But this infrastructure depends on social institutions, which are frequently subject to breakdown. I made this point when I bumped into some ardent advocates of cryonic suspension in California in the 1980s. How long would it take to develop the technologies that were needed to resurrect frozen cadavers as living organisms, I wondered. Not much more than a century, I was told. I asked these techno-futurists to consider the events of the past hundred years or so – a devastating civil war and two world wars, a ruinous stock-market crash and the Great Depression, for example. Given this history, how could they be confident that their refrigerated cadavers would remain intact for another century? The companies that stored them would surely go bust, wars and civil disturbances would lead to power failures, and the legal system that protected the cadavers could disappear. The United States might no longer exist in a recognisable form. The cryonicists looked at me blankly. These were scenarios that they had not considered and could not process. Such upheavals might have happened in the past, but the future was going to be quite different. For these believers in technological resurrection, American society was already immortal. At bottom, the transhumanist movement is a modern variant of the mystical dream of transcending contingency – the vulnerability that comes with being subject to accident and the power of events – that possessed many in ancient times. These mystics wanted to be absorbed in a timeless, impersonal absolute, a refuge from the ugly conflicts of the human world. They understood that this refuge could only be entered if they shed their individuality and practised asceticism and contemplation in an effort to erase their personal identity and desires. Less intelligent than their ancient precursors, contemporary transhumanists imagine that they can become immortal on terms of their own choosing. Pondering a conversation he had with one of the techno-mystics, O’Connell worries that only the extremely wealthy could afford to be uploaded to a virtual world. The rest of us would have to struggle on, bombarded by messages from cyberspace trying to sell us some product for which we have become targets through our use of the internet. But, to my mind, the super-wealthy few would not be much better off. The greatest problem with everlasting life in cyberspace is the prospect that it would have to be spent in the company of other cyber-immortals. As Max More and some of his fellow transhumanists have envisioned, each of these disembodied minds might design its virtual body and environments as it pleased. But might not these virtual environments somehow overlap or collide? Cyberspace is a projection of the human world, not a way out of it. What if the few who had escaped their ageing flesh found themselves side by side with an immortalised Donald Trump, his orange hair undyingly abundant, presiding over a ­never-ending Mar-a-Lago? It is not for nothing that the gods in some Greek myths regarded immortality as a curse.

Sign up for our weekly email * By Caroline Crampton Follow @@c_crampton         Print HTML The opening of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony includes four of the most famous notes in classical music. Three short, one long – “dum, dum, dum, duuuuum” – it’s an instantly recognisable, and slightly ominous, pattern. For a conductor, it presents a daunting challenge. Everyone thinks they know how it should go, so how do you make your version stand out? On a chilly January morning at London’s Southbank Centre, five conductors took it in turn to stand in front of the BBC Concert Orchestra and give those four notes their best shot. These women had travelled from all over the world, including from Australia and Portugal, to raise their baton and see what kind of sound they could coax from the orchestra. The first up, 34-year-old Natalia Raspopova, currently an assistant conductor with the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, guided the orchestra through what sounded like a creditable attempt at Beethoven’s well-known work. But then she was interrupted: the real star of the show stepped forward to give her some feedback. “You lead, don’t wait for them,” Marin Alsop, the leader of this conducting workshop, said, as she demonstrated a more effective baton movement and stance. On Raspopova’s next attempt, the difference in the orchestra’s sound was immediately apparent – crisper, and with a greater sense of urgency and forward momentum. If anyone in the audience had any doubt that there is more to conducting than just waving your arms about, Alsop had just shown them otherwise. Alsop is the only woman conductor to have the kind of fame and name recognition that male maestros like Simon Rattle, Daniel Barenboim and Valery Gergiev have long enjoyed. Born in New York City in 1956 to musician parents, she attended Yale University and the Juilliard School, and then studied conducting with Leonard Bernstein. In 2007, she became the first woman to be made the musical director of a major American orchestra, when she was put in charge of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In 2013, she was appointed music director of the Sao Paulo State Symphony Orchestra in Brazil. The same year, she was the first woman to conduct the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The workshop at the Southbank Centre was part of a larger initiative to provide opportunities for women in the classical music industry. Alsop, now 60, is very active as a mentor and advocate on this topic. Chief among her many education and outreach projects is the Taki Concordia Conducting Fellowship, founded in 2002, through which she provides a two-year mentoring scheme for women conductors at the start of their careers. Alsop founded the Fellowship, and participates in workshops like this one, because she is baffled by how few women conductors there still are, she explains when we sit down to talk in the deserted Southbank Centre artists’ bar. “I assumed, naively, that there would be more and more women in the field as I went,” she says. “I just hunkered down and was doing my own thing, and then when I came up for air after five years, there was nobody else. Ten years, nobody else. Fifteen years – where is everybody. Twenty years – a few of us, but the numbers didn’t really seem to change. So then I really had to make a conscious effort to say, ‘well, how can I help?’” Pete Woodhead / Southbank Centre Her experiences are borne out by the statistics. According to figures for the 2012-13 season quoted by Mother Jones, Alsop was the only woman conductor among all 22 biggest-budget orchestras in the US. In other areas of classical music, such as solo performance and composition, far more progress has been made towards gender equality, even if parity is still a way off. And yet the role of conductor – the intellectual and physical centre of the orchestra – has remained a near-all male preserve. Why is that? Alsop thinks it has more to do with familiarity than prejudice – although the latter is still around. “People aren’t comfortable with seeing women in these roles, because there aren’t any women in the roles,” she says. “When you’re the only one, you’re always a target. . . Women have so few opportunities, comparatively speaking, that the pressure is enormous, and if you mess up the one opportunity, then you don’t get a second.” The skill set required to be a conductor is formidable: musicians aspiring to that role must have an outstanding ear, Alsop says, as well as superb musicianship and a strong sense of inner pulse or rhythm. But as well as all that, they must have a presence on stage, and the kind of body language that can elicit the best sound from musicians. Physical signals are incredibly important in maintaining authority over an orchestra, too – when I ask about staying comfortable on long rehearsal days, Alsop fires back with “I’ve never sat down for a rehearsal”. “Everything sends a message,” she explains.  “If I sit down, the message is that either I’m tired, or that it’s casual, or it’s too much effort. If my students ever sat down in a rehearsal, that would be it.” Alsop is brusque and efficient in her manner, with a very dry sense of humour. Several times during the workshop she gets a laugh from the orchestra and the audience with her comments – such as “don’t move your hips, I hate that!” or “I find you a little scary” – but there’s no doubt that even the lightest tap on the shoulder or adjustment of an elbow from her can completely transform the sound her pupil makes with the orchestra. From the audience, it almost looks like magic. An underrated skill a conductor must have, she says, is managing the musicians – just as any boss would manage employees. “That’s a thing that often young conductors speak to me about. . . ‘I think they don’t like me,’ they say, and I say, really, it doesn’t matter, because your job is to represent the music and the composer, and that’s all you have to do. You’re not there to be liked.” Marin Alsop conducts the Britten-Pears Orchestra and percussionist Colin Currie at Royal Festival Hall on 7 April as part of the Southbank Centre's International Orchestra Series.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch.

But that’s likely to change over the next few years, as banks, payment companies and even the likes of Google and Facebook push so-called peer-to-peer, or p2p, payment systems – a medium of exchange with revolutionary potential. The apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other, and they even could make inroads at the cash register and with businesses that send refunds and other payments to their customers. These systems will get a boost later this year when a coalition of the nation’s biggest banks roll out Zelle, a mobile and online money-transfer network that will let any customer of nearly every U.S. bank send money to customers of any other bank using only a phone number or email address. Analysts say the bank-led system – and the related marketing push – should bring online and mobile peer-to-peer payments to a larger audience. Even competitors, notably the popular money transfer app Venmo, say the Zelle rollout could boost their fortunes by making digital-money transfers more mainstream. “We don’t see it as a winner-take-all scenario,” said Josh Criscoe, a spokesman for Venmo owner PayPal. “We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash.” Online and mobile peer-to-peer payment systems have grown rapidly over the last few years, and analysts expect that to continue. In a report published in March, finance industry research firm Aite Group estimated that Americans made about $147 billion in digital p2p transfers last year, up from $100 billion the year before. Those are big numbers, to be sure, but last year’s sum still only accounted for about 12 percent of the more than $1.2 trillion that Americans paid each other that year, mostly in cash. That means there’s still plenty of growth ahead, said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group. In her report, she estimated that the volume of digital p2p payments will more than double by 2020, topping $316 billion. “Not that many consumers are using mobile payments yet,” Baker said, noting that though these payments are more common among young consumers in big coastal cities, they’re not so ubiquitous elsewhere. “I’m a Gen-X person and I live in Denver – I hadn’t heard of Venmo until 2015.” There are plenty of players in the p2p game. Square Inc., the payments company behind the tiny white credit card reader that plugs into a smartphone, has a p2p service of its own, Square Cash, which launched in 2013. Following the geometric theme, there’s also Circle, a Boston firm that started the same year and specializes in cross-border p2p transfers in dollars, euros and British pounds. Facebook and Google, too, allow users to send money to friends. Google has Google Wallet, which started as a mobile wallet app but became a p2p payment tool in 2015, and Facebook users have been able to send money through Facebook Messenger since 2015. Square, Google and Facebook don’t report the volume of payments made through their p2p systems, but Facebook in regulatory filings has said that only “a relatively small percentage” of its users have used the payments feature. Venmo is arguably the biggest name in peer-to-peer transfers. It even has the coveted status, like Google, Uber and a few others, of becoming a verb – as in “Venmo me.” Founded in 2009, the company was acquired in 2012 by payment services provider Braintree, which was acquired the following year by online payments giant PayPal – which offers p2p payments under its own name too. But the biggest players in the market are still the banks. Last year, Venmo users transferred $17.6 billion. That’s more than double the volume from 2015, but it’s also much less than the $28 billion transferred in 2016 through QuickPay, JPMorgan Chase’s peer-to-peer payment system. And that’s just one bank. Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other major financial institutions have had their own p2p transfer programs for years, though it can sometimes be clunky for bank customers to send money to people with accounts at other financial institutions. Stay Informed.

Banks accounted for the rest, though much of that likely was made through banks’ websites, not mobile apps, and much of it was money transferred between customers of the same bank. In part, that’s a statement about who uses different systems, and what they are used for. Venmo and other non-bank systems are accessed about twice as often as bank systems, but for much smaller transactions, according to Aite Group. The average money transfer on a non-bank system is $135; the average for bank systems is $1,359, according to the report. That might suggest that parents sending money to a student for college tuition, for instance, might be more likely to transfer money through a bank, while students are much more likely to split a restaurant bill or bar tab using Venmo.

Google Turns On Universal Suggest In Mobile Search Chris Dehghanpoor View All Posts 2010/04/08 9:34pm PDTApr 8, 2010 1 Plus 1 on G+ 0 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares1 News Tips & Tutorials Today Google announced universal search suggestions on the mobile version of their search page. It has been enabled on all major smartphone platforms, so even our iPhone carrying “friends” should be able to partake. Google first made this change on the desktop version of the search page back in December, and while it was neat, I can’t say I’ve really played with it since it was released. This probably has more to do with the fact that I just control+K to the search bar in Firefox or Chrome rather than visit the search page itself. If you missed the original announcement, universal suggestive search provides real time information in the drop down box that appears when you begin typing, in addition to the regular search term suggestions. The idea being that if you were to type in ‘weather houston’, it would provide you with the weather right in the box, rather than you having to go through the hassle of pressing enter, then clicking on a link from the results page (gasp!). I’ve played around with the mobile version for a bit, and I must say that it's quite helpful. Little tweaks like this make a lot of sense in the mobile browsing environment where you may already be frustrated with latency and awkward typing, and anything that can save a few clicks is valuable. While I appreciate that universal suggestive search is available in the browser, I’d really like to see Google integrate it into the Android Google search widget. I’ve been using Searchify to provide similar capabilities in Android’s built-in search, but an official solution would be a plus. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see it crop up in the near future (I’m looking at you, FroYo). In total, there are supposedly 10 keywords you can use to take advantage of this for the desktop, 7 of which I was able to use on the mobile version. You can find the complete list, with examples, and a few screenshots of my experience with the update below. Searches keywords: Unit Conversions. Example: Entering “1 oz in cups” will provide you with the conversion of 1 fluid ounce into cups Flight Tracking. Example: Entering “AA 1” will show you the latest flight stats for American Airlines flight 1 Local Time. Example: Entering “local time london” will give you the local time in London Area Codes. Example: Entering “area codes houston” will provide you with a list of area codes for that locale. In this case it seemed to fetch the results from a random dating site (though they were accurate) Calculator. Example: Entering “2*16” will provide you with the answer. Currency Conversion. Example: Entering “1 dollar to pounds” will provide you with the exchange rate for dollars to pounds. Local Weather. Example: Entering "weather houston" will show the weather in Houston, TX, along with a little weather icon Tags announcements Google mobile mobile search multi-platform search subscribe ...

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | April 9, 2017 -- 01:23 GMT (18:23 PDT) | Topic: Smartphones Nokia smartphone-licensee is targeting to be the top Android smartphone player and betting on brand nostalgia in Asia as well as its focus on offering native Android services to fuel its ambition. HMD Global in May last year was awarded an exclusive 10-year license to develop, market, and sell Nokia devices including feature phones and smartphones, which would run Google's Android OS. The deal also included Nokia-branded feature phones sold by Microsoft over the past three years and Microsoft's manufacturing facility in Vietnam, which was acquired by Foxconn's subsidiary, FIH Mobile. Latest news on Asia Nokia bets on APAC nostalgia to drive smartphone comeback ​The G6 is fine, but now LG needs consistency or faces demise ​Samsung to launch Asiana Airlines edition Galaxy S8 ​LG to post second-highest operating profit for first quarter Samsung boss attends first hearing of bribery trial Nokia would receive royalties from every Nokia-branded device sold by HMD, a Finnish company set up in December 2015, in which Nokia was not a shareholder. Nokia had earmarked 2017 as the "brand's return to smartphones". To date, Nokia 6 was the only smartphone launched and available in China and Taiwan, while the low-end feature phone Nokia 150 was launched in India and Europe last December. Plans now were underway to introduce its products across Asia-Pacific in the second quarter of 2017, including the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, according to Flann Gao, HMD's Asia-Pacific communications director. Based in Singapore, which served as the company's regional headquarters, Gao told ZDNet it was targeting to launch most of its phones in all markets in the region, though, availability would depend on whether the local market was dependent on 2G or 3G networks. He acknowledged the mobile landscape had changed significantly since Nokia last reigned, with the Asia-Pacific region already crowded with global and local players including Xiaomi, Apple, and Samsung. He believed, though, that Nokia still had a unique opportunity to regain ground. Pointing to the strength of its brand, he said consumer awareness of the Nokia name in Asia-Pacific remained high despite the fact it had not released any products in the last few years. He added that consumer perception mostly was positive. Because it previously offered phones across a wide range of price-points, he noted that consumers in different market segments were receptive to the Nokia brand. This was not necessarily the case with other marker players, he said. Wider product mix will give competitive edge, but no plans beyond smartphones for now Clement Teo, principal analyst at Ovum, said Nokia could find a place in the mid-tier segment amid the crowded mobile market. "Producing a well-designed mid-market smartphone will allow them to be a strong alternative to the likes of other mid-market smartphone players like Huawei, Oppo, Samsung, and Xiaomi," Teo said in an email interview. He said the introduction of Nokia's N1 tablet in 2014 in selected Asian markets had sparked much anticipation about the vendor's return to the consumer market. He suggested that offering a mix of smartphones, tablets, and wearables--via Nokia's Withings acquisition--could provide the competitive edge it needed against major players that had an ecosystem of multiple gadgets, such as Sony and Apple. The analyst also pointed to Nokia's investment in IoT, particularly in digital healthcare, as a key market to watch. The Withings acquisition was key as Nokia took a more strategic approach to the consumer IoT market, which Teo said promised higher growth rates than the flattening smartphone and tablet segments. "Even though Nokia plans to capitalise on its brand in the smartphone segment by using third-party manufacturers, we expect IoT to be of higher priority," he said. Aggregating, processing, and redistributing health data captured by wearables, and potentially smartphones, could fuel Nokia's push into cloud-enabled digital healthcare, he noted. "In such a form, digital healthcare should be able to encompass not only consumer self-tracking, but also professional medical services." Nokia, though, would have to move quickly to keep up with competitors that also were making a play for the healthcare space, including Apple with HealthKit and Samsung's S Health. HMD, however, currently was focused on mobile phones and had no plans to launch tablets, yet, Gao said. Its license with Nokia included tablets, but not wearables. While feature phones were generating significant revenue, the company's long-term goal was to be the world's leading Android smartphone vendor, he said. He added that there were some 500 million to 600 million feature phones globally, with Nokia ranked the top or second-largest players in most major markets such as Vietnam, India, and several in Southeast Asia. Aim to lead with stock Android Noting that Asia-Pacific was a highly fragmented mobile market, Gao said HMD was aiming to take the lead in the Android world with its pledge to provide the platform "in the purest form", stripped of preloads and skins. Its phones would run stock Android, similar to Google's Pixel, which would ensure the devices received the monthly security updates from Google and the latest system updates. HMD's decision to work closely with partners such as Google as well as FIH Mobile, as its manufacturing partner, enabled the startup to operate on a leaner model and be more nimble, he said. It also would adhere to Nokia's brand guidance to ensure its phones reflected the latter's design history of being "very human", he added. "Our ambition is to be top Android smartphone player in the next few years." HMD's global base of "a few hundred employees" currently included product designers, product managers, and sales and marketing managers--many of whom, such as its chief marketing officer, formerly were from Nokia and Microsoft. The Finnish startup covered 100 markets across eight regions such as Asia, Europe, India, and China, and had 500 partners worldwide, including distributors, retailers, and telcos. Its team in Asia-Pacific comprised "several dozens" and the company was recruiting, Gao said, but would not specify the number of people he was looking to hire. He said the company had presence in almost all markets in the region, including offices in Australia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. HMD had singled out millennials and the younger generation as an important consumer segment that would help drive its success, he noted. When it launched Nokia 6 in China at the start of the year, partnering e-commerce operator JD.com, 76 percent of customers who bought the phone were millennials, he said. He declined to reveal sales figures for China, but said 1.3 million customer registered for the phone during the launch in January and its first batch of units sold out in 23 seconds. He said HMD chose to launch in the Chinese market first because it was highly competitive, accounting for half of the world's smartphone sales, and would offer valuable consumer feedback.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images By Patrick Kulp2017-04-07 03:34:38 UTC Amazon dominates online shopping, cloud computing, and now, it has its sights set on advertising. The online shopping giant has been quietly beefing up its ads business in recent months, and Wall Street is starting to take notice. SEE ALSO: Forget Facebook and Google: The ad world thinks this tech giant is 'terrifying' An analyst at Morgan Stanley predicted this week that the company could pull in $5 billion in ad revenue by next year. For context, that's more than twice Snapchat's forecasted revenue for that year and about half of Twitter's entire market value at the moment. That number could swell to $7 billion by 2020, according to the research note. Even so, Amazon would only make up a 4-percent share of the digital ads market, which is dominated by Facebook and Google. Another analyst at BMO Capitals pegged that number at a slightly more modest $3.5 billion next year. But the bank noted that Facebook and Google should absolutely be nervous about Amazon's growing clout on their turf. That's because advertising online is both about attracting eyeballs and understanding where they're coming from. Amazon has been logging away massive amounts of data on its customers' shopping habits for years, and it rules the e-commerce market. As much as they have tried, Facebook  and Google have never been able to turn their platforms into shopping destinations — people still leave their sites when they actually want to buy something. Amazon doesn't have that problem.  BMO's Daniel Salmon summarized that appeal succinctly: While Google knows what people are searching for and Facebook knows what people are interested in and who they are connected to, Amazon knows the specific products that customers are purchasing and how frequently they are purchasing these products.   To punctuate his point, Salmon also downgraded his outlook on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet. He thinks Amazon is already eating into the company's revenues, and it represents a bigger threat than the current advertiser boycott the search giant is facing over offensive YouTube videos. Adding to the pile-on was NYU Stern School of Business professor Scott Galloway, who told CNBC that the company is already becoming a more important search engine than Google. "[Amazon is] the most disruptive company in the largest economy in the world," he told the financial channel. Sentiments like these have rattled the advertising world lately as the industry begins to register the threat posed by Amazon's ambitions. Martin Sorrell, head of WPP, the biggest traditional advertising company in the world, said on an earnings call last month that the e-commerce company was his number-one fear. Perhaps rightfully so.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google today talked about new research it has been doing to power search query suggestions in its Gboard virtual keyboard app for Android. This will involve training artificial neural networks on data that’s stored locally on mobile devices, instead of sending it all to Google’s fleet of servers. In the past few days, Googlers have published academic papers on the two components involved: a concept called “federated learning” and the underlying privacy system, called “secure aggregation.” “When Gboard shows a suggested query, your phone locally stores information about the current context and whether you clicked the suggestion. Federated Learning processes that history on-device to suggest improvements to the next iteration of Gboard’s query suggestion model,” Google research scientists Brendan McMahan and Daniel Ramage wrote in a blog post. McMahan and Ramage foresee using these same technologies to improve photo rankings “based on what kinds of photos people look at, share, or delete,” as well as the Gboard’s language models. This research arrives nearly a year after Apple said that it was deploying a concept called “differential privacy” to turn out smart QuickType and emoji suggestions in iOS 10. Google’s system starts with the current model for making query suggestions, then learns over time from locally stored data, and then summarizes the changes with what Google calls an “update.” The update is what is sent back to Google in an encrypted fashion, and Google averages it with all of its other updates. The actual data stays local, and Google can only decrypt its average update if there are hundreds or thousands of users contributing to it. The Google paper on secure aggregation for federated learning acknowledges differential privacy, a co-inventor of which, Cynthia Dwork, works at Microsoft Research. But Google has in fact explored differential privacy in the past, including with its randomized aggregatable privacy-preserving ordinal response (RAPPOR) work that’s been tested in Chrome. Now Google is looking at going deeper into the area and also implementing its secure aggregation model — which depends heavily on small encrypted summaries of data instead of actual data, whereas differential privacy entails incorporating random noise into calculations with data — with one of its more prominent apps. Gboard for Android currently has 500 million to 1 billion app installs, according to the Google Play Store. Update on April 7: Added detail on the secure aggregation and differential privacy.

Mary Altaffer / AP Listen Listening... / Originally published on April 5, 2017 6:21 am There's a new brand on the Internet that's taking over some old ones — or at least old in Internet years. Yahoo and AOL are now under an umbrella company called Oath. The new brand has sparked more than a few jokes on Twitter and elsewhere. One critic pointed out it sounded a lot like Oaf — and another asked if "Oof" was already taken. But with more than a billion customers, the combination has potential. AOL CEO — soon to be Oath CEO — Tim Armstrong says consumers aren't really going to hear that name very much. "The Oath brand is a brand that stays behind the scenes," he says. "The real brands that we're going to be promoting are things like Yahoo, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, TechCrunch, Huffington Post." Oath, the umbrella under which Yahoo and AOL will live, is the result Verizon's $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo — which it will merge with its AOL operations. Armstrong says users of Yahoo products will be able to keep using them, but they're probably going to see a lot more cross-promotion of content and brands owned by Verizon. Yahoo itself hasn't been able to really turn the popularity of its products into big money-makers. They'll try to change that under Oath and Verizon. Susan Etlinger, an analyst at Altimeter, says that combining customer data from Yahoo, Verizon and AOL could make it all more appealing to advertisers. "The big question in my mind is, what is it that Verizon is going to bring to the table from a data point of view that's going to enable them to patch this together into some kind of really useful ad targeting force?" Etlinger says. The combined subscriber bases could position Verizon well as the third-biggest player in targeted advertising, behind Facebook and Google, says Jimit Arora, who leads IT services research for Everest Group. He adds that the rebranding no different than when Google's parent company became Alphabet. Congress just eased Internet privacy regulations, which would allow Verizon to share and profit from a lot of the information it gets about Yahoo users. But that's a mixed bag, says Etlinger — because revelations about serious security breaches at Yahoo already have consumers on edge. "I think they're going to have a huge burden of proof that they can be trusted with the kind of data that they are going to be using" she says. Trust us, says AOL CEO Armstong — we've got your data and your back. "From our standpoint, there's an investment that will be going into a much deeper level of security," at both AOL and Yahoo, he says. "We've already greenlit that investment." Users will also be seeing changes in the companies' approach to their privacy. For example, they may have to change passwords more frequently, and there could be other levels security. "[We'll have] a system that we use that allows consumers to understand how their individual actions affect the security and readiness of their accounts," Armstrong says. The breaches that happened at Yahoo came under its current CEO, Marissa Mayer, who has been there for about four years. There has been a lot of speculation as to Mayer's future, but all Armstrong would say is that the new executive team probably will be announced in late June. Meanwhile, he is going to be in charge of some old Internet brands, and he says he plans to infuse them with new life and content. "If you come use our products and services, we will offer you the fountain of youth" — and Armstrong says that's an oath. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. DAVID GREENE, HOST: So there's a new brand on the Internet that is going to take over some of the old ones, I mean, I guess old in Internet years at least. Yahoo and AOL are now under an umbrella company called Oath. As NPR's Laura Sydell reports this new brand name has sparked more than a few jokes, but with more than a billion customers, there is potential here. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: The tech press and the Twittersphere (ph) had some fun with the new name Oath - O-A-T-H. One critic pointed out it sounded a lot like oaf, and another asked if oof (ph) was already taken. But AOL CEO, soon-to-be-Oath CEO Tim Armstrong, says consumers aren't really going to hear that name very much. TIM ARMSTRONG: The Oath brand is a brand that stays behind the scenes. The real brands that we're going to be promoting are things like Yahoo, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, TechCrunch, Huffington Post. SYDELL: Oath is the umbrella under which Yahoo and AOL will live. It's the result of Verizon's $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo which is merging with its AOL operations. Armstrong says users of Yahoo products will be able to keep using them, but they're probably going to see a lot more cross-promotion of content and brands owned by Verizon. ARMSTRONG: As a consumer, you'll be more aware of the brands that we own because they'll marketed aggressively on a global basis. SYDELL: Yahoo itself hasn't been able to really turn the popularity of its products into big money makers. The question now is whether that can change under Oath and Verizon. Susan Etlinger, an analyst at Altimeter, says combining customer data from Yahoo, Verizon and AOL could make it more appealing to advertisers. SUSAN ETLINGER: The big question in my mind is what is it that Verizon is going to bring to the table from a data point of view that's going to enable them to patch this together into some kind of really useful ad targeting force? SYDELL: Congress just eased Internet privacy regulations. That would allow Verizon to share and profit from a lot of the information it gets about Yahoo users. But that is a mixed bag, says Etlinger, who spoke over Skype. She says revelations about a serious security breach at Yahoo already have consumers on edge. ETLINGER: I think there's - they're going to have a huge burden of proof that they can be trusted with the kind of data that they are going to be using. SYDELL: Trust us, says AOL CEO Armstrong, we've got your data and your back. ARMSTRONG: From our standpoint, there's an investment that will be going into a much deeper level of security. And we've already greenlit that investment, and that - both at AOL is happening, as well as will be going into Yahoo. SYDELL: And users will also be seeing changes in the company's approach to their privacy. For example, they may have to change passwords more frequently. And there could be new levels of security. ARMSTRONG: Having a system that we use that allows consumers to understand, you know, how their individual actions, you know, affect the security and readiness of their accounts. SYDELL: The breaches that happened at Yahoo came under its current CEO, Marissa Mayer, who's been there for four years. There's a lot of speculation as to Mayer's future. All Armstrong would say is that the new executive team will probably be announced late June. Meanwhile, Armstrong is going to be in charge of some old internet brands. He says he plans to infuse them with new life and new content. ARMSTRONG: If you come use our products and services, we will offer you the fountain of youth. SYDELL: Armstrong says that's an oath.

The BlackBerry Priv is among a group of devices that achieved an update rate of 60 percent to 95 percent for its monthly security releases, including the Pixel devices; Nexus 5, 6, 5X and 6P; OnePlus and OnePlus 3; Samsung Galaxy S7; Asus Zenfone 3; LG V20 and Sony Xperia X Compact. “We are honored that PRIV was included in Google’s Android Security: 2016 Year in Review, and we take this as a signal that we’re living up to our promise to deliver the world’s most secure Android software platform,” stated BlackBerry senior vice-president and general manager of the mobility solutions division Alex Thurber in a blog post on Inside BlackBerry, adding: “It’s especially gratifying that the Priv was named among the market’s security leaders for the second year in a row.” BlackBerry was also named as one of four manufacturers (the others being LG, Samsung and OnePlus) that deliver Android security updates to flagship devices on the same day that Google updates its own smartphone — at least for unlocked devices bought directly from BlackBerry or its manufacturing partners. Thurber acknowledged that carriers sometimes hold updates “for various reasons.” Additionally, the report lauds BlackBerry for deploying a fix to a zero day vulnerability known as “Dirty Cow” — which was publicly disclosed on October 19th, 2016 — in time for the November 2016 security update. Google wrote in its report that in 2016, Android security updates addressed 655 vulnerabilities, 133 of which were critical in severity, 365 high, 154 moderate and three low — representing a more than 275% increase from 2015.

Lil’ Sooky Denton Shoggy ain’t allowed outta the basement till he clears those crusty tissues out from under the bed… Dimitri And yet many put Blackberry down yet even Google agreed that the Priv is the most secure device out there. I am proud that Google showed this. Maybe now some can actually believe it but hey, they all have their own opinions. Also when did Samsung and LG send out the updates? Lol the carriers barely release them as is. Dean Lubaki But it does not matter because Android, even with BlackBerry is still more insecure than iOS. We’re starting to use iPhone in the Ontario Public Service, and Android, even with BlackBerry, are nowhere to be found. Pretty sad! 2112 More insecure than iOS? gee I guess all the iOS hacks recently are false? the Cia openingly hacks iPhones all the time, theres a reason why top execs and governments use secure Blackberries, get your facts straight Vish Those were older iOS versions – think iOS 7.x ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Well even Bla1ze pointed out there was an original version that did NOT include the Priv for some reason. And both DTEKs are still not on the list. Bill Patrick I love my DTEK60, but I’m still waiting for the Nougat update 🙁 🙁 >:( Ken Aisin I love my Priv. Also waiting for the Nougat update too. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Until BlackBerry stands behind their current phones and actually update them to Nougat, the KEYone’s “software” and “secure” promise rings hollow. TheCuddlyKoala They got your money, you’ll never see an update.. Ken Aisin That’s fine. I still love the phone though. TheCuddlyKoala They got your money, you’ll never see an update. Rev0lver Is there an echo in here? Lil’ Sooky Denton Congratulations on the 59 Tomahawks by the way. That’ll learn Ass-Ad good, reeeeeeeal gooood. canucks4life Most secure because no one bought it? Sorry couldn’t resist 🙂 2112 I have 2 Detek 60’s, 2 Detek 50’S AND 2 Priv’s … the Detek60 is the clear winner phone wise, But I agree PRIV is more secure. TheCuddlyKoala how do you talk on all of them? Are you an Octopus? J-Ro An octopus has ears? Magic18 Yes… 8 of them… Octa=8 Lil’ Sooky Denton Lol! And also in the news; ‘The CEO of Tata automobiles says Tata vehicles are the safest on the roads…’ TheCuddlyKoala Until Chen hands over your “privacy” to authorities….. 2112 Heck iPhones are just plain hackable period ask the CIA…or a 5 year old Lil’ Sooky Denton I’m 3 and a half an’ I never heard that. Lil’ Sooky Denton True dat ^^ ^^ (2 cats behind a wall…) JD If they remade this thing with the SD820, all the short comings fixed and <$700 CAN It would sell like hotcakes. tacoma I am user of Priv for 2 years now, previously Galaxy Note, Sony and Moto phones. Verdict: very very happy with Priv. High performance in all respects. Absolutely trust it. With today’s lower price, an amazing bargain for such a premium device. But what do I yearn for? Well, there is always something… I love to have a bigger, wider physical keyboard. Yes, BB, its the keyboard thing again. I want more … So happy BB remains in the mobile phone business. But what could a Priv Mark 2 be? Here’s a few suggestions: – Keep the format, the slider so that the OLED big screen stay – Wider and generally bigger physical keyboard. Love to see a numeric row, if this can be done. If screen size have to slightly smaller to get a bigger keyboard, so be it. – Dual front loudspeakers. – Removable battery. Allow extended off-grid or cold weather usage with multiple battery packs. This is an engineering challenge but the designers are up to it. – Shorten boot time. – Wireless charging for all models. Two USB ports (any type). But why? One for charging and one for data connection to USB devices that do not provide power, but drain considerable power instead. – General hardware update – Stainless steel construction. OK is this a joke and an wild crazy dream. Lil’ Sooky Denton Yay…That sucker’ll stand up in a firefight with them Tabilans!

After taking a screenshot there’s an option to crop or draw in the share window, above the usual share options. The ‘Crop’ setting allows users to cut a portion of the screenshot, with a done or cancel option at the bottom. While ‘Draw’ lets users choose from six different colours to draw on the screenshot with, it also has an undo to the bottom left and a X for cancel and a check mark for done at the top. Although editing screenshots isn’t new and is possible with apps, this new integration would be a much quicker and more efficient method than before that’s easily accessible on all Android devices. This feature is currently only available in the beta version of the Google App, however this might be a feature coming to everyone in the future. Although we couldn’t replicate the feature in the MobileSyrup office, here is how you can become a beta tester, so you can give it a try for yourself.

Here’s how to get the most out of them Subscribe to our newsletter. Abhijit Ahaskar Maps not only provides price estimates and availability of cabs, but even allows users to book a cab and make payment form the Maps app itself. What makes Google Maps one of the most popular navigation apps is the sheer amount of options it offers. Google has no desire to rest on the laurels and has been regularly adding new features to its Android and iOS apps to make it more relevant and user-friendly. We take a look at some of the latest features that have been added to Maps and how they can help users get the most out of them. As of now, Route options you can add are avoid motorways, avoid toll roads and avoid ferries. Remember route preferences Google Maps by default shows the fastest possible route based on the traffic status on all the possible routes. So, if a route is longer and has several tolls but less traffic, Maps will show only that route. Now Maps allows users a bigger say in the roads they want to take and will remember it for future route suggestions. As of now, Route options you can add are avoid motorways, avoid toll roads and avoid ferries. To access it, open Maps->enter destination, start navigation and tap on the three dots icon at the top of the page and select Route options. Anyone can share their real-time location with their Google contacts for a fixed duration or until the user turns it off manually. Share your location Google Maps not only shows your own location and routes but can also show the route of a family member or friend travelling late at night. Anyone can share their real-time location with their Google contacts for a fixed duration or until the user turns it off manually. To activate it, go to Menu->Share location and follow the instructions. The feature works within Maps and doesn’t ask users to download another app. You can book a cab and see all the options in Maps just like in an Uber or Ola ap. Book a cab from Maps Maps not only provides price estimates and availability of cabs, but even allows users to book a cab and make payment form the Maps app itself. This means you can book a cab and see all the options in Maps just like in an Uber or Ola app. Payment can be made through Paytm, cash or credit cards. The good part is that you don’t need any of these apps to be on your phone to book a cab. However, you will need to link your Ola and Uber accounts with Maps, so it can open the API of these apps within its own interface.

Photo by David Drexel via Wikimedia Commons (CC BY 2.0) Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world. Elections have become a time when Internet censorship, online harassment, and the deliberate spread of misinformation escalate. Last year, social media networks were blocked in Uganda and Montenegro during national elections. In the Gambia and Gabon, the Internet was shut down altogether. Harassment of political candidates and activists alike was a hallmark of special parliamentary elections in Macedonia, presidential elections in the US, and last week’s chief executive elections in Hong Kong. As elections approach in Iran, hardliners are pressuring the Rouhani administration to block the Telegram messaging app. And the tide of harassment is rising in both Russia and France, as both nations prepare to choose their next leader. Elections in Armenia and Ecuador last week proved to be no exception. The lead-up to general elections in Armenia was marred by apparent attempts to thwart the online activities of journalists and at least one incident of fake news. A prominent civil society figure reported attempts by government-backed hackers to access his email account, and several Armenian journalists said their accounts on Twitter were suspended just before the vote. Their accounts have since been restored. Election monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe (OSCE) said the elections, which resulted in the victory of the current ruling Republican Party of Armenia, were generally well-administered, but still tainted by credible accusations of vote-buying and undue influence on civil servants and employees of private companies. Meanwhile in Ecuador, opposition party candidates and supporters faced a wave of social media account suspensions, as did media rights NGOs. Pro-opposition websites and a handful of NGOs publishing voter education information noticed a sharp decline in web traffic on local ISPs on the evening of the election, leading to suspicions of interference. The website for the Internet access group Usuarios Digitales also experienced a DDoS attack a few days before the election, as did the website of opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso. LiveJournal seals deal with Russia, bans ‘political solicitation’ After the blogging platform LiveJournal — which was acquired by the Russian company SUP Media in 2007 — moved its data servers from California to Russia. This means that the website’s data will now be fully accessible to Russian police, in accordance with Russia’s recently enacted “anti-terrorist” legislation. Along with other restrictions, an updated LiveJournal user agreement prohibits “political solicitation”, but does not define the meaning of the term. Will Google go back to school in China? Google Scholar may be the first Google service to return to China, according to a statement by senior Chinese lawmaker Liu Binjie. “China has been in touch with Google through various channels,” Binjie said, signaling hope that a part of Google’s business (which Binjie described as “service functions that do not involve [politically] sensitive information”) would return to China first, and be gradually followed by others. Google pulled its services from the Chinese market in 2010 due to a conflict over China’s strict censorship rules, but has expressed interest in returning to the market. Binjie’s remarks did not make clear whether censorship would be implemented in any of Google’s services. Bangladesh regulator rejects Facebook bedtime ban The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission rejected a proposal to block Facebook between the hours of midnight to 6:00am, a measure proposed by lawmakers who argued that Facebook was “dimming the working capabilities of the youths” and should therefore be inaccessible during bedtime hours. The BTRC instead has suggested that parental controls and privacy and security features would be a better method to achieve this objective. The BTRC’s recommendation now leaves the final decision up to the government. UAE intellectuals and activists face threats in court, and online Prominent academic Dr. Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced by a UAE court to 10 years in prison for “posting false information” on Twitter about UAE leaders “in order to harm the reputation and stature of the State.” According to Amnesty International, bin Ghaith made comments on Twitter that he had not been given a fair trial in an earlier case in which he and four others were prosecuted for “publicly insulting” the country’s leaders in online comments, in what is known as the “UAE Five” case. He may appeal the sentence within 30 days. Dr. bin Ghaith’s case follows that of Ahmed Mansoor, another member of the UAE Five, who was arrested the week prior. Supporters of Mansoor who tweeted about his arrest were attacked for defending a “traitor that deserves to die”. Global Voices volunteers analyzed the interactions between supporters of Mansoor and those who attacked them and found that some of the most influential tweets critical of Mansoor came from accounts that appear to belong to government employees or affiliates, who led hardline government supporters in online attacks against Mansoor. Spy stingrays spotted in Canada An investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation found that IMSI catchers, devices that spy on cellphones within a geographic area, are being used in the area around Ottawa’s Parliament Hill. Also known as Stingrays, IMSI catchers work by mimicking a cellphone tower and scooping up the data available within an area, typically of all devices within a radius of half a kilometer. Though CBC journalists confirmed that the IMSI catchers were being persistently used around Parliament, they were not able to determine who was using them. Indian developers take on “fake news” on WhatsApp, Facebook Two Indian technologists, Bal Krishn Birla and Shammas Oliyath, are working to build a website, check4spam.com, which will help to detect fake messages spread using WhatsApp and Facebook. The initiative aims to curb the spread of false and malicious information and to “make life easy for the common man and life trouble for spammers.” New Research Big Data: un aporte para la discusion de la politica publica en Colombia – Fundacion Karisma     Subscribe to the Netizen Report by email     Afef Abrougui, Ellery Roberts Biddle, Rezwan Islam, Kevin Rothrock, Nevin Thompson, Laura Vidal and Sarah Myers West contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2017, file photo, YouTube CEO Susan Wojicki speaks during the introduction of YouTube TV at YouTube Space LA in Los Angeles. Google’s online package of about 40 television channels debuts on Wednesday, April 5, 2017, in the tech industry’s latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for television. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) New York • YouTube TV, Google's new streaming package of about 40 television channels, is the tech industry's latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for live TV over the internet. It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don't confuse the YouTube service, which debuts Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T's DirecTV, YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. VIDEOS TOP JOBS But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven't been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet; getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century . ——— WHAT YOU GET ... AND WHAT YOU DON'T YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS — but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won't get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you'll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of "The Walking Dead." Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area — all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. ——— SEARCH PARTY As you'd expect from Google, search is one of YouTube's big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as "aliens" or "road trips." Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress. A search for "nerd comedy" brings up "The Big Bang Theory," but "comedy about nerds" does not. And a search for "Modern Family episode on basketball" doesn't bring up the episode titled "Basketball." YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually — too much work for a service that promises simplicity. » Next page...

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 162 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares340 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over.

But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) 95 Follow Share Tweet Technology giant Google is being sued by the Department of Labor over accusations that the company systematically underpays women for the same work as men. Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, made the claims during a court hearing in San Francisco on Friday, according to the Guardian. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” she said. Further, Labor department regional solicitor, Janet Herold added, according to the Guardian: The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters. The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry. Google vehemently denied any wrongdoing in a statement. “Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” they said. But for years, there has been a problem with Silicon Valley’s hiring practices, considering that a large portion of tech company employees are white and Asian men. According to the Associated Press, just one-third of Google’s employees are women. Even then, just 19 percent of the overall workforce consists of women in technology roles. More from the AP: The Labor Department’s probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers’ privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs. The allegations come just days after national “Equal Pay Day,” a day where companies and activists nationwide gathered to fight the alleged pay gay between men and women. Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today → https://t.co/KTuGTJMV16 pic.twitter.com/rBciSK21uF — Google (@Google) April 4, 2017 In addition, the company added on its famous homepage under the Google search bar: “Google supports equal pay.” That, however, might be false if the government’s allegations prove correct.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business. I would be surprised if they don't already have a plan in place to cut the labor cost of delivering a package by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years. » reply Online retail Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:40.

It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don't confuse the YouTube service, which debuts Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T's DirecTV , YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven't been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet; getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century . ___ WHAT YOU GET ... AND WHAT YOU DON'T YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS — but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won't get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you'll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of "The Walking Dead." Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area — all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. ___ SEARCH PARTY As you'd expect from Google, search is one of YouTube's big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as "aliens" or "road trips." Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress. A search for "nerd comedy" brings up "The Big Bang Theory," but "comedy about nerds" does not. And a search for "Modern Family episode on basketball" doesn't bring up the episode titled "Basketball." YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually — too much work for a service that promises simplicity. One big plus: YouTube's unlimited DVR will store recordings for nine months, long enough for entire seasons of network shows. Sony's PlayStation Vue — the only similar service offering an unlimited online DVR — offers only 28 days of storage, nowhere near enough for binge-watching. YouTube TV works on phones, tablets and laptop browsers. Watching on an actual TV requires Google's Chromecast, an inexpensive streaming stick you control with your phone. (Early subscribers get one for free.) ___ ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY This being Google, your viewing and search histories might be mined for targeted advertising. You can suspend tracking in the settings, though that will hinder personalized recommendations. (It's too early to tell if that's a loss or not, though some of the early recommendations have been spot on.) You can share your subscription with five friends or relatives in your household, with three simultaneous streams allowed. No need to share passwords; they sign in with their own Google accounts. Recordings and recommendations are kept separate, so your roommates can't make fun of you for bingeing "The Real Housewives."       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business The Canadian Press 2017         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   AURAK Signs MoU with OAIRO Alliance Triton Aviation Finance Announces That It is Considering Strategic Alternatives FANUC Introduces R-30iB Plus Robot Controller           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

It’s even better if you take advantage of its numerous useful features. Many users never think to adjust default settings. By customizing Google Calendar to your needs, you can save time Save Your Time With 10 Underused Google Features Save Your Time With 10 Underused Google Features Google's tools and services do everything for us. But there are a lot of features that go underused. Save a few seconds and get more done with the Google tools you use every day. Read More and be more organized in the long run.

However, you will see several others you can customize. To access the settings for your default calendar on the web, go to calendar.google.com, log into your account, click the Settings (gear icon) from the top navigation, and select Settings. Make sure you are on the General tab and click the Save button after any changes. Default and Custom Views Do you find yourself constantly changing to the Day or Week View when you first sign in? Or maybe you would prefer to see a three-day instead of a five-day view. You can adjust both of these settings. Default View You can choose from day, week, month, custom, and agenda views as your default. Just scroll down to Default View and pick your preference. Custom View Right below the Default View setting is an option to set the Custom View. You can choose from 2–7 days or 2–4 weeks. Your choice will replace the default five-day view on your main calendar screen. Local Weather Are you planning a weekend getaway or business trip? You can use the local weather option to pop a forecast for the next few days right onto your calendar. This eases planning and lets you stay within Google Calendar to get your forecast. Just scroll down to enter your Location with city and state or zip code. Then, below that enable either Celsius or Fahrenheit for your preferred temperature. This puts a small icon onto your calendar for each day showing sun, clouds, or rain. You can also either put your mouse over the icon or click on it to see the high and low temperatures for the day. If you want to make sure those you have shared your calendar with see this information, click the Copy to Calendar link. This will insert it as an all-day event and can be handy for vacation planning with family 12 Productive Ideas for a Shared Google Calendar 12 Productive Ideas for a Shared Google Calendar Google Calendar is a phenomenal productivity tool.

Invitation Options Do you receive event invitations that pop onto your calendar even though you have not accepted? And, you have no interest in attending them? Changing one simple default setting can save you from a cluttered calendar of events you will never attend. You can change this in the Automatically add invitations to my calendar setting. You can choose Yes to have all events displayed or No to have none at all. An in-between option will display the event, but not send a notification to the coordinator until you respond with Yes or Maybe. Two items to note on this setting. First, if you choose the No setting you will not see events you want to attend until you respond with Yes. Second, if you have shared your calendar, others will see those events even if you have not responded yet. Default Event Duration and Speedy Meetings Do you prefer to set the end time for events as you create them? Or would you like to encourage quick meetings for your employees? You can easily set your default duration and include the option to create Speedy Meetings. Default Event Duration You can choose from No end time to 15 minutes and up to 120 minutes for your events by default. This is handy if you prefer to pick end times without a default or always schedule one-hour meetings. Make your choice in the Default Event Duration drop-down box. Speedy Meetings Google Calendar has a feature to assist you with meeting efficiency. If you are in a position where you must attend consecutive meetings, this can be convenient to get you there on time. Mark the checkbox for Speedy Meetings and then the duration will be adjusted per your default. 30-minute meetings will end five minutes early, one-hour and longer meetings will end 10 minutes early. This default setting will set durations as 25, 50, 80, or 110 minutes. The intent is for you and your participants to wrap up quickly so you can move onto the next meeting or task. Settings for Your Other Calendars You might create, import, or access shared and public calendars Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar A calendar keeps every aspect of your life focused in one place, allowing you to worry less and accomplish more. Here are some useful ways to import important information into your Google Calendar. Read More . If you set up one on your own, you have complete control. But you can also make a few adjustments to other calendars to make them more useful to you. To access your other calendars on the web, click the Settings (gear icon) from the top navigation and select Settings. Click the Calendars tab and you will see those that you can view and modify along with those you can only view. Change the Display Name What if you would like your spouse’s calendar to show their nickname or the Holidays calendar to be called Celebrations. For shared and public calendars, you can change the name displayed for your viewing. Click on the calendar, change the Calendar Name at the top, and hit Save. Edit Notification Settings Would you like to receive a daily agenda via email or find out when your spouse cancels an event on their calendar? Any calendars that allow you to adjust the notification settings will display a link in that column. Once you click that link, you have a variety of options. At the top, you can choose to be notified via email for timed and all-day events. Just click the Add a notification link and select the amount of time before the event to receive the notification. In the next section, you can pick how you would like to be kept up-to-date with the calendar. You can mark the checkboxes next to new, changed, or canceled events as well as event responses and a daily agenda. You will then receive an email for those you have chosen. Click Save and you’re set. Shared Calendar Options What if you hire a new employee and want to share your calendar? Or, maybe you want to let your spouse make changes to events on your calendar? If you have shared your own calendars, you can adjust those settings at any time. While still in the Calendars section, click the Shared: Edit Settings link for your calendar. You can quickly add a person by entering their email address or remove someone by clicking the trash can. For new people you add and those already listed, you can adjust the permission settings. Open the permissions drop-down box and then make your choice. You can allow that person to make changes and manage sharing options, only make changes to events, view only your free and busy times, or see all event details. Since these permissions can be adjusted differently for each person you share with, it can be very convenient for work situations. For example, you might want your boss to see all event details, but your employees to view just free and busy times. Calendar and Event Colors Do you want your work events to show up in a bold red color, but personal ones to display in sunny yellow? By default, the color assigned to a calendar will display events in that same color. If you only use one calendar, then this is probably not an issue for you. However, if you have more than one of your own and access to shared and public calendars, consider changing their colors for better organization. This is done on your main Google Calendar page. Simply select the arrow next to the calendar that you want to change in the left navigation. Then, pick your color and that’s it. Color-coding your calendars and events helps you to see what is on your schedule with a quick glance. Which Default Settings Do You Find Most Helpful? While many of the default settings can be obvious, people do not often change them. Either they are unaware that these changes can be made or simply have not taken the time to do so. But if you use Google Calendar regularly How to Make Google Calendar Collaboration Even Smarter How to Make Google Calendar Collaboration Even Smarter There are many ways to make Google Calendar smarter. Here are eight tools to make your schedule work better for you with minimal effort on your part. Read More , then setting it up just the way you want it is essential.

Pulling information from PolitiFact, a website dedicated to fact-checking U.S. politics, as well Snopes, another fact-checking website, this time dedicated to debunking urban legends, the company will now display information on whether something a website or news piece claims is accurate. Google first added fact-checking functionality to Search back in October of last year. At that point, the feature was only available to search engine users in the U.S. and U.K. In addition, at that point, Google had only partnered with Jigsaw. The company later expanded the availability of the feature to other countries this past February. Notably, the fact checks do not come directly from Google; instead, the company is depending on third-party organizations to do the hard work of vetting information. The company also notes its sources may sometimes contradict one another. “This information won’t be available for every search result, and there may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions,” says the company. “Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.” Source: Google Via: The Next Web Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Reddit Featured Articles CRTC reveals phase one of plan to transfer telephone subsidy to broadband funding Kik CEO says he wants to create a completely new payments experience in chat Electronic Arts pledges to invest $500 million in Montreal’s game industry over 10 years Poop Troop Emoji Keyboard provides you with a poop animation for every situation Graceful Explosion Machine is the first Canadian-developed Nintendo Switch game Sign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Thank you for your subscription Related Articles News Mar 22, 2017 9:53 AM EDT Google adds handy shortcuts to Search News Aug 26, 2016 7:13 AM EDT You can now play Solitaire in Google Search News Apr 6, 2017 3:16 PM EDT Support for self-dismissing notifications announced for Android O News Apr 5, 2016 10:55 AM EDT Google’s new search feature will have you making animal noises Comments Cameron Davidson Nicely done!

The fad gadget you strap to your wrist has seen a precipitous fall in the last year. Pebble closed its doors after releasing a solid fitness tracker, and Fitbit has struggled (though we liked its new Fitbit Alta HR). There's also the fact that fitness trackers, while great for athletes, seem to not actually help most of us lose weight. Image: Fitbit Which means if you're desperate to track sleep or steps or how many calories you consume you might be better off sticking to your phone. If you've taken a dive into your phone's fitness apps lately, you'll have noticed it can track your steps, your runs, and even your sleep without any help. So really, what's the point of buying yourself a separate wearable? Maybe your phone is enough tracker Image: Apple All contemporary smartphones come packed with sensors, which help it sort out where you are on a map, what orientation you're holding the phone in, and so on. It turns out these tiny components can do a lot of fitness tracking, too. Both Google Fit and Apple Health, depending on your choice of OS, are capable of keeping tabs on the steps you've taken, the distance you've covered, and the calories you've burned as you make your way about your day. Image: Google Google Fit is the more fitness focused of the two platforms, as its name suggests. Try adding an activity and you get a hundred to choose from, including everything from water polo to backcountry skiing. A lot of these activities can only be tracked in a very loose way, but the options to record them are there. Apple Health gives a more rounded picture of your health, and while it doesn't have quite as many activity categories as its Google counterpart, it goes into more detail and depth. For example, it includes the option of tracking caffeine intake and glucose levels. Image: Strava What apps do you need to turn you phone into a tracker? You don't necessarily need another device to keep tabs on a lot of these extra measurements, but you do need extra apps. There's a pile of apps, from Strava to Runkeeper, that can measure walks, runs, and bike rides using only your mobile phone, and in a lot more depth than your phone's own software can. (Both Strava and Runkeeper can share data with either Google Fit or Apple Health if necessary.) Image: Sleep As Android And an app such as Instant Heart Rate Monitor (for iOS or Android) can measure your heart rate using the technology built into your phone's camera. It might not be as accurate or as comprehensive as using a device strapped to your wrist or your chest, but it can add new depths to your health tracking, and the apps come with plenty of useful options for analysis and assessment. Apps can use your phone's sensors to figure out just how much quality shuteye you're getting as well. Sleep as Android can judge how restful for night has been for Android, while Sleep Cycle is one of the best options for iPhones or iPads. That's a lot of data you can keep on top of using nothing but your phone and a well-chosen app or two, though admittedly, there's more manual input involved if you want to go beyond the basics of step counts and sleep times, and it will definitely drain your phone's battery a little faster. Yet, as your phone is usually always with you, you may not need that separate tracker. Why you might still want a fitness tracker Image: Fitbit If you do decide to pay extra for a dedicated fitness tracker, the first benefit you get is portability: you don't have to lug a 15cm phone around on your morning jog, because a snug wristband or a tracker clipped to your pocket is doing all the tracking for you. With many smartwatches now including GPS, you can track your location too. Smartphones might feel like extensions of our natural bodies these days, but for some high-intensity activities you really don't want to take your phone with you. From running around on a soccer pitch to doing laps of the pool, the more advanced your fitness activity, the more a dedicated tracker starts to make sense. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And by fitness tracker we also mean smartwatch with advanced fitness tracking capabilities — being able to glance at your wrist as you hit the home straight of a 5K run is much more convenient than trying to fish your phone our of your pocket. The latest fitness trackers also bring more sensors and more accurate sensors to the table: whether it's the continuous heart rate tracking of the Apple Watch or the altimeter, barometer, and compass built into the Garmin Fenix 3, you can usually expand on the monitoring capabilities of your phone with a dedicated wearable. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo That often translates into less time spent manually inputting data — if there's one sticking point likely to interfere with your fitness tracking goals, it's having to enter data manually. It's a job that just never gets done, or doesn't get done often enough, and you don't have to worry about it if you're wearing a device that knows the difference between a gym session and a jog without being told. Of course there are a wide range of fitness trackers out there, some of which do a better job than others at keeping tabs on what you're doing, but generally speaking you get more automation and more detail with an extra device to help your phone along. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And all that's before you get to the app and software that comes with your tracker, which you may well prefer to the built-in offerings from Apple and Google — Fitbit's bundled app is particularly handy and gives you a detailed breakdown of your stats on the web as well as on your phone. The big downside to a fitness tracker? It's another gadget you'll need to be charging every day (or week), and the majority of trackers are big ugly rubber bands. Those are nearly as aesthetically pleasing as a smartphone in your back pocket. Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

Experts have since said amputations may have been wrongly blamed on a spider bite, and authorities now consider a bacterial infection to be responsible for the man’s injuries. Despite this, the damage to the largely harmless white-tail may have been done.

Industry watchers said the latest move by the tech company is in line with its plan to use LG Display's OLED panels in its Pixel smartphones. If the deal is reached, Google can also reduce its dependency on Samsung Display Co., another South Korean panel maker. LG Display said it cannot provide comments on speculation circulating in the market. Industry watchers said Google is seeking to form a strategic partnership with LG Display through the deal, rather than just making a purchase agreement. LG Display will also benefit from Google's potential investment as the company has been seeking to move its focus to OLED panels from liquid crystal display (LCD) products. colin@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

If you don’t know what I’m talking about, Google “Pepsi commercial” and I’m sure you’ll find the ad itself, along with a thousand think-pieces and Pepsi’s official apology. And now, an SNL skit. In short, the commercial features Kendall Jenner leaving a photoshoot to join protesters as they pass by. Then, for some reason she hands a police officer a can of Pepsi and everyone cheers. I don’t know if Pepsi set out to get political, but I definitely don’t think they intended to minimize the complexity of activism. I’d like to think that their advertising team just thought the ad would resonate, that people might find it cool and progressive. Obviously they were wrong, because the commercial was met by so much criticism that they stopped running it and released an official statement. Many people who chose to analyze the ad thought it was tone deaf and insensitive. One of the more generous reviews simply called it harmless. My take, like many others’, was that it was a failed attempt to capitalize on current events. But, to many, an ad in which Kendall Jenner somehow “solves” citizen-police relations by handing a model-esque officer a can of soda was not just harmless, it was insulting. Among the critics was Bernice King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter, who tweeted “If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi” with a picture of her father being held by a police officer. After sifting through a number of articles about the ad, I figured that just about everything had already been said, and I scrapped the one I wrote. But before that, I was given a chance to think about why I had even written it in the first place. When a friend of mine first asked me what I was thinking of talking about in my column this week, I mentioned the commercial. Her response was something along the lines of, “Do you really think that matters?” It wasn’t rude or judgmental, it was just an earnest question. The conversation, I’ll add, took place Thursday, as President Trump was addressing the nation regarding action in Syria, people all over the world were reacting, and I was editing my thoughts on whether or not Kendall Jenner was complicit in a politically problematic soda ad. I understood what my friend meant, and yet I don’t think that I have the authority to dictate what “matters,” regardless of the political climate — which sometimes makes writing these columns kind of challenging. If you determine that one thing doesn’t matter, you risk closing the door on consideration for other things. If it’s deemed frivolous to discuss an advertisement from a major corporation that botches the portrayal of important topics, what else do we risk writing off? Does it matter when President Trump’s son compares refugees to skittles, or when the Academy Awards showcases predominantly white artists? Does it matter when hate speech is graffitied on walls, or when Airbnb hosts send racist messages to their tenants? And if we stop paying attention to these so-called “minor” issues, where should we redirect our attention? In a world where every breaking news alert seems to be another addition to the garbage fire that is our political climate, I think it’s impossible to delegate our attention perfectly. Pay attention to things that matter to you, pay attention to things that matter to other people, and pay attention to as many things as you possibly can. I think that if you watched the commercial and it made you think critically about activism, about the relationship between citizens and police, or about anything else, it mattered. If you watched the commercial and it offended you personally, it mattered. If you watched the commercial and you think the backlash was unwarranted, believe it or not, I still think it mattered. Fortunately there isn’t a cap on how many things we can deem important, relevant or interesting; we don’t have to choose between focusing on “small” issues and focusing on larger issues. We can do both. I think we just need more practice.   Jacqueline Groskaufmanis is a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Related Diverse Class Arrives on Campus By ryan August 21, 2000 Cornell’s summer calm ended abruptly Friday as the Class of 2004 swarmed campus. The expected 3,152-student freshman class filled dorm rooms, met with Orientation Counselors and interacted during the traditional first night. In the next few days before classes, freshman will arrange course schedules, complete swim tests and placement tests and get an all around taste of Cornell’s student performing groups at Cornell night. The academic caliber of Cornell’s newest students is exceptionally high, according to President Hunter R. Rawlings III. Citing comparatively high SAT scores and a greater proportion of underrepresented minorities, he described the incoming class as “stronger than ever.” Donald A. Saleh, dean of admissions and financial aid, also praised the new students’ academic credentials. “For the fourth year in a row we’ve seen composite SAT scores go up,” Saleh said, adding that there has been a “general shift upward” in all the quality indicators of the freshman class. According to Saleh, more freshmen — 82 percent this year — are coming from the top 10 percent of their high school class. “This is a strong indicator of Cornell’s appeal among high-ability students,” said Doris Davis, associate provost for admissions and enrollment. She stressed that the entire process grew more selective this year as the University acceptance rate fell to 30 percent from last year’s rate of 33. “This made the overall admission process very competitive,” Doris explained. “These results speak very well for Cornell.” Lynne Abel, associate dean for undergraduate education, explained that this year’s record-low acceptance rates were possible because the admissions office filled most of the class with early decision applicants. The office was especially happy to report that the yield on admissions offers increased this year. Davis said that 51 percent of students accepted Cornell’s offer of admission, a two percent increase from last year. To an extent, the higher yield on acceptance offers comes as a surprise to the admissions office. Given Cornell’s drop in the U.S. News and World Report rankings during this past year, a higher admissions yield might seem unlikely. But as Saleh explained, rankings only play a small role in a student’s selection process. “Much of what we accomplish is governed by the general reputation of the University,” he said, praising the administration’s public relations efforts. Saleh stressed that the University constantly strives to promote the accomplishments of its faculty and students. Of the 3,152 freshmen who are currently enrolled for the fall, the admissions office expects about 140 to change their decision to attend, a phenomenon known as the “summer melt.” “This is a typical situation,” Saleh said. “We lose two to three percent of incoming freshmen from the end of June to September.” He cited exchange programs, financial burdens and one-year deferrals as factors for the reduction. The admissions office makes its final count of the class at the end of the third week of classes. However, this year’s summer melt has gone slower than anticipated. As Davis explained, “since we admitted fewer students this year, we were expecting that we would be closer to our enrollment target of 3,000 students.” Although the admissions office has notified Campus Life of the anticipated class size well in advance, the North Campus Housing Initiative is creating additional constraint on the size of the class. To guarantee housing for all freshmen, the office must aim for a target of 3,000 students. “The last two classes have been huge, and we need to even out the pipeline or we’ll be flooded,” Rawlings said. In keeping with efforts to diversify the student body, the admissions office sent 13 percent of acceptance letters to underrepresented minorities, a slightly higher percentage than last year. “Word has gotten out that Cornell cares about its undergraduate education,” Rawlings said. “We have been seeking out as many minority students as we can.” Of the 3,152 incoming freshmen, five percent are African-American, another five percent are Hispanic, three percent are bi- or multi-racial, and less than one percent are Native American. Although fewer Native American and Puerto Rican students applied this year, the University remains pleased with the overall diversity of the freshman class. “It will serve to enrich the education students will receive at the University,” said Robert L. Harris, vice provost for diversity and faculty development. He attributed the increase in minority applicants to “more intensive recruiting efforts” that began last August. Such efforts included a phone-a-thon and mailings to underrepresented minority applicants with promising scores, according to Abel. This year, the College of Arts and Sciences conducted two hosting programs for underrepresented minorities. Abel explained that the arts college has had difficulty in inviting all the students who wanted to come and visit in the past. But this year, with financial help from Vice Provost Mary Sansalone, the college had enough money to invite all African-American applicants. As a result, the number of African-American freshmen in the arts college this fall increased from 51 to 84. International students, making up 8.5 percent of the Class of 2004, add to the diverse mix, with Singapore, Canada and Hong Kong as the most represented countries, according to Wendy Schaerer, senior associate director of undergraduate admissions. Saleh explained that international students tend to appreciate Cornell’s strong programs more than its Ivy League status. “In engineering, hotel, architecture and agriculture, Cornell beats the Ivy competition for international students,” he said. In addition to minority and international recruitment efforts, the arts college, for the first time, has sent special postcards to all incoming arts freshmen. “We’ve asked them if they want to update us on their area of interest for advising purposes,” Abel said. Approximately 1030 freshmen have enrolled in the arts college for the fall. Even with an admissions rate of 25 percent, the lowest of Cornell’s seven colleges, the college is hoping get down to 990 students by September, according to Abel. Although one third of arts college freshmen have declared themselves pre-medicine, Abel explained that the majority of students remain undecided as to their field of study. “I sent them a letter saying it’s okay to be undecided,” she added. In contrast, students entering the College of Engineering tend to be more focused on a specific area, according to Betsy East, director engineering admissions. “From past research, we know that about 75 percent of freshmen indicate a major field of interest,” East said. Although a student’s field of interest is not factored into the admissions process, the majority of the 803 freshmen enrolled in the engineering college indicated either electrical and computer engineering or computer science as their field of interest. However, East noted that most change their mind before declaring a major. The engineering applicant pool was stronger this year based on a small rise in composite SAT scores. While a 39 percent acceptance rate might appear lofty when compared with the lower rate in the arts college, the applicant pool is far more self-selecting than other schools, according to Saleh. “The quality of applicants is up,” said John Hopcroft, dean of the engineering college, noting that 93 percent of applicants were in the top ten percent of their high school class. Deborah Cox, assistant dean of student services, stressed that the quality of the class is “the most significant difference [between engineering and the other colleges]. Engineering students quantitatively have the highest scores i n the University,” Cox said, noting extremely high verbal scores across the class. The percentage of enrolled female freshmen engineers continues to remain lower than that of males, although this year the figure increased three percent to 25.2. The engineering college also conducted extensive recruiting of underrepresented minorities earlier in the year. For example, the engineering college hosted 13 guidance counselors from the Chicago area. “We wanted to establish relationships with them and provide them with an inside look at the [engineering college] and the University,” East said. In the School of Hotel Administration, 172 freshmen, including 24 transfer students will fill Statler Hall this fall, according to Don Bishop, associate dean for enrollment. Attesting to the expansive reaches of the hotel industry, the class of 2004 will include 21 international students. Bishop stressed that although the academic credentials of all applicants to the college were strong, the selection process emphasizes more than just SAT scores. Hotel admissions rejected 48 percent of applicants who scored over 1400 on the SAT. “We don’t rely on SATs as much because we’re looking for other dimensions. We want bright students with leadership and an interest in serving people,” Bishop said. The College of Human Ecology sought students who were “very interested in human beings,” Jennifer Gerner, associate dean of the human ecology college, said. The 243-person class, while slightly smaller than the desired number, is “the strongest class we’ve ever had,” according to Gerner. Due to increased applications, the acceptance rate in human ecology dropped by five percent this spring. 30 percent of the students are out-of-state residents. The College of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR) admissions officers looked for students with interests that suited the school’s program, according to Mary VanArsdale, director of admissions and student services. “We’ve had the most outstanding students apply in our entire history. They are truly remarkable,” she said. Approximately one quarter of ILR acceptance offers were mailed to early decision applicants. As a result, regular acceptance rates fell five percent. The College of Architecture, Art and Planning, the smallest of the University’s seven schools, received 120 acceptances. “The students are all very strong academically and we put a high priority on creativity with art and architecture,” said Elizabeth Cutter, director of admissions for the architecture college. Even after the admissions office finalizes the incoming freshman class, it must continue working to retain several members. A key to attracting admitted students is the quality and quantity of the financial aid the University provides, according to Thomas C. Keane, director of financial aid and student employment. Cornell supplied just over 50 percent of entering freshmen with financial aid, awarding a total of $63 million, a five percent increase from last year, according to Saleh. A fundraising campaign that concluded last December netted over $230 million for the financial aid endowment. “This is extraordinary. … It has allowed us to maintain our commitment to need-blind admissions and to enhance our packages somewhat,” Saleh said. Compared with its peer institutions, Cornell’s financial aid packages are “in the middle of the league,” in terms of the mix between loans and grants, he explained. “Our loan-work portion is higher than grants,” Saleh said.Archived article by Ken Meyer Tambroni Named Head Coach of Men Laxers By ryan August 21, 2000 A rise to power in the national spotlight interrupted? This is the question the Cornell men’s lacrosse team will have to answer when it takes the field next spring. The Red finished the regular season with a 10-3 mark, including a 5-1 record in the Ivy League. In its NCAA Tournament first-round contest against Georgetown, Cornell was leading 12-9 with 11:30 to play in the contest. However, the Red’s inexperience in tournament situations showed, as the Hoyas rallied for the final five goals of the game, including three in the last 2:47, to end the Red’s fantastic season. While the Red was certainly unhappy about letting such an opportunity slip away, it could take solace in the fact that this was its first tournament appearance since 1995. In addition, the team had only five graduating seniors, and a talented young coaching staff, lead by Dave Pietramala. However, with the completion of the season, the head coaching position at Johns Hopkins, Pietramala’s alma mater, opened up, and the Division I coach of the year returned home. This switch came after Pietramala lead the Red to a 23-17 record in three years. The two years before his arrival Cornell had gone 3-11. Cornell also achieved its first 10-win season since 1987, and handed national champion Syracuse its lone loss of the year in a 13-12 game played in Schoellkopf Field. On the day of his resignation, Cornell athletic director Andy Noel named Pietramala’s assistant Jeff Tambroni as the Red’s new head coach. “I was very fortunate to work for one of the greatest coaches [Pietramala]. However, it is a great opportunity to take the reigns of a top-10 lacrosse team, being a first time coach,” Tambroni said. Tambroni had been the offensive coordinator for three years under Pietramala at Cornell. Before coming to East Hill the Hobart graduate was an assistant at Loyola College for two years. While in college, Tambroni was a first-team All-American his senior year, and was a second-team All-American the two years prior. Wynne Named Assistant After a two year stint as the head lacrosse coach at Virginia Wesleyan College, Robert Wynne has joined the Cornell men’s lacrosse staff as an assistant coach. Jeff Tambroni, first-year head coach and a former teammate of Wynne’s at Hobart, announced the decision this past July after the Red posted a 10-3 regular season record. Wynne expressed his excitment at joining the Red staff. “I’m thrilled to be a part of a university and program with such integrity and tradition. It is a great honor,” he said. Before heading to Ithaca, Wynne led his 2000 Marlins to a No. 20 National Ranking and an overall record of 7-7. This came after a 9-5 overall record in 1999. Before joining the Virginia Wesleyan staff, Wynne was the assistant coach at Hampden-Sydney College where he was the offensive coordinator and in charge of recruiting. Prior to that job, Wynne served as the assisant coach at his alma matter. Wynne, a 1994 graduate of Hobart, left the Statesmen after accumulating an impressive resume including two national championships, two first-team All-American honors and the title of nation’s top midfielder in 1994. Tambroni is very excited to have Wynne as his first assistant coach. “He is a wonderful young coach and will bring a strong personality to the team.”Archived article by Kristen Haunss Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

In 1995, it was less than 1 percent. The number of internet users has increased tenfold from 1999 to 2013. The first billion was reached in 2005. The second billion in 2010. The third billion in 2014. Source: internetlivestats.com Although local internet provider Guadalupe Valley Electric Cooperative officials have the power to sell their customer's information, they chose not to. President Donald Trump signed a bill April 3 repealing internet privacy rules passed last year by the Federal Communications Commission that would have given internet users more control over what their providers can do with their data, according to The Hill, a political website. The regulations would have required internet service providers to get permission from their customers to use data including browser history, financial and medical information and geolocation to marketing companies to create targeted advertisements. Guadalupe Valley Electric Cooperative offers internet and electrical services to 13 counties, and provides internet to almost 10,000 customers, said Ceason Barnick, company senior executive manager. "We have never done that," she said. "I think it's our duty to protect our members' information. We see it as our responsibility, to protect all of our customers' information. That's from the ground up. Whether we're talking about our internet company or electric co-op." Andrew Baerg, University of Houston-Victoria associate professor of communications, talked about the issue with one of his classes last week. Baerg doesn't agree with Trump's decision. "Personally I'm really uncomfortable with how much of our data is collected," he said. Corporations are very interested in an individual's personal data, Baerg said. If put in place, the FCC laws would have allowed for some collection in certain situations, he said, if there was a security issue. But now that Trump has repealed them, a different story is told. "Now the door is swung wide open, and your Suddenlink can know exactly where you're going on the internet," he said. "They can sell it to whoever is interested. Of course, we're not going to get a cut of that. We're paying a company like Suddenlink, and we're giving up our data as we pay." Google and Facebook use collected information for targeted advertisements, Baerg said, but in a way users exchange that information for their free services. Corporate internet providers want to have the same power as free services such as Google and Facebook, he said. Internet providers selling information could cause problems, he said. For example, recovering alcoholics could search something related to their problem on their browser and start seeing beer advertisements, he said. "That would not help them," he said. "That could apply to sensitive medical information as well. Why aren't we doing anything about it, if it's potentially harmful?" Congressman Blake Farenthold said the internet has been so successful because it is not over regulated. He said he believes the less regulation the better. "The narrative that companies are now able to sell your internet service provider data is simply not true," he said. "There are numerous state and federal wiretapping laws, privacy policies from companies, agency regulations and the marketplace itself where consumers are protected from bad actors that all protect online privacy." Mike Sizemore, owner of Sizemore Media and Consulting, said he uses the internet constantly personally and for his business. It's wrong for the government to allow corporations to use his private information, he said. "This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, this is a freedom issue and a constitution issue that people shouldn't have the right to use my private information," he said. "If you did a poll about Americans and their private use of their internet, most would agree that they do not agree that their private information should be sold." Sizemore said it's not just about his internet usage regarding his business, but any usage. "They can sell that to big businesses to market projects to me or political information to me or a wide variety of information that could come my way based on whatever my internet habits could be," he said. Prosperity Bank has a strict policy about maintaining confidentially with their customers' information and that will not change with Trump's decision, said John Zacek, the bank's South Texas area chairman. Prosperity Bank's business reputation and customers have heavy reliance on this policy, he said. The President's decisions will not impact the bank because of its privacy policy. "Internet privacy rule changes will not change the way we operate when it comes to the value we place on confidentiality and maintaining our customer's privacy," he said. Craig Goodman, University of Houston - Victoria political science associate professor, believes that Trump's decision comes from his distrust of government. The Trump Administration has been populated by Wall Street individuals who see danger in regulating new industries. "The internet has been a hot topic going back to the Obama Administration whether or not the internet is completely free or if it should be a regulated utility like electricity," he said. The decision is an example of Trump's tactic of rolling back the government's control, Goodman said. "This is an easy way for the Trump Administration to get a win and roll back another Obama-era regulation," he said. Regardless of Trump's decision, not much will change because internet providers already had the power to sell users' information as the FCC rules were never put in place, said Michael King, Information Systems and Integration chief operating officer. "Basically the status quo remains," he said. As a business owner who deals with cybersecurity, King opposes Trump's decision. "Just as average citizens want privacy, businesses should also have a right to privacy as well," he said. "You essentially don't want the government or third party interest to have access to what you're doing online." In the absence of these FCC regulations, there are steps people can take to protect their information, King said. They can use virtual private network services that encrypt data from the end user to the internet service provider. There are also browsers that encrypt internet activity. "Ultimately, those things can be probably overcome if someone was inclined to dig deeper into your internet activity," he said. If people don't agree with Trump's decision, they should contact their elected officials and express their concern. "I also take issues that your internet service provider you are paying for internet services can then monetize your internet activity to be further profitable," he said. "Internet service providers have a bad history of protecting consumers' privacy."

Shares for Lotte Shopping, the retail arm of conglomerate Lotte, fell by 1.59 percent, while shares of LG Electronics plunged 1.97 percent. Asian equities were mixed in Monday trade despite heightened geopolitical tensions after a missile strike on a Syrian airfield last Friday ordered by President Donald Trump and a move by the US military to send an aircraft carrier group near the Korean Peninsula in response to recent provocations by North Korea. Trump said the strike targeted an airbase responsible for launching a chemical attack in northeast Syria earlier last week. The attack was launched while Trump was hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida resort. North Korea responded to the strike by stating that it was a justification for its own nuclear weapons program, adding that it had to protect itself against Washington's "reckless moves for a war." In turn, a US Navy strike group is expected to move near the western Pacific Ocean and close to the Korean peninsula following North Korea's multiple nuclear missile test launches this month. The news did not weigh on Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index, which bounced 0.77 percent. The ASX 200 was higher by 0.58 percent, driven mostly by its utilities and energy sub-indexes. The Kospi was down by 0.52 percent, with China-exposed stocks pressured following heightened tensions in the Korean peninsula. Shares for Lotte Shopping, the retail arm of conglomerate Lotte, fell by 1.59 percent, while shares of LG Electronics plunged 1.97 percent. Shares of LG Display, LG Corporation's LCD manufacturing arm, popped 1.17 percent at 30,200 won per share on a reported offer from Google to invest a minimum of USD 1 trillion won (USD 880.29 million) in screen production. The investment would assist in increasing the production of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for Google's Pixel line of smartphones, the Electronic Times said. LG Display did not respond to an email request for confirmation about the investment. Mainland Chinese markets traded lower, with the Shanghai Composite declining 0.21 percent and the Shenzhen Composite 0.485 percent lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dipped 0.15 percent. The dollar was higher against a basket of currencies at 101.250 at 9:30 am HK/SIN time, its highest level in nearly 3 weeks. The dollar/yen traded at 111.41, higher compared to levels around 110.86 seen last week while the Aussie was softer at USD 0.7505, versus the USD 0.76 handle seen last week. In corporate news, miner Rio Tinto reported paying USD 4 billion in taxes and royalties last year after it was ordered to pay an extra USD 284 million with interest due to its operations in tax-friendly destinations. The news comes as the Australian Taxation Office pays greater attention to the amount of taxes paid by multinational corporations based in Australia. Rio Tinto shares were up by 0.64 percent and trading at AUSD 60.395. On the energy front, Brent crude was up 0.22 percent at USD 55.36 a barrel while US crude was higher by 0.34 percent to USD 52.42 a barrel. In Japan, the February un-adjusted current account balance surplus jumped to the largest since March 2016 at 2.814 trillion yen, compared to 2.616 trillion yen seen. Other economic data expected today includes Australia February home loans and outstanding loan growth for the month of March from China later in the day. Stateside, US equities closed flat in reaction to the missile strike, with the S&P 500 shedding 0.08 percent to 2,355.54 points, the Dow Jones industrial average tracking lower by 0.03 percent to close at 20,656.10 and the Nasdaq down by 0.02 percent to finish at 5,877.81. This was also on the back of a mixed jobs report, which saw just 98,000 jobs added in March, below expectations of 180,000 new jobs."Now that the US nonfarm payroll is over, traders are going to put their focus back on the Fed, who have been talking about winding down their balance sheet. The Fed need to be very careful in their approach of conveying their message while they release their purchased bonds back on the market," Think Markets chief market analyst Naeem Aslam said in a note. tags #Asian equities #Asian markets #Hang Seng #Kospi #Nikkei 225Â index #North Korea #Shanghai composite Related news Business Asian equities mixed with Nikkei posting gains despite regional tensions Apr 10, 2017 07:37 AM Business Asia stocks meander ahead of Trump-Xi talks, US jobs data Apr 07, 2017 07:28 AM Business Trump, Xi to establish personal rapport during first summit Apr 06, 2017 01:39 PM Business South Korea test fires 800km-range missile Apr 06, 2017 10:13 AM Business Asia stocks slip, investors on edge for Trump/Xi meeting Apr 06, 2017 07:33 AM Business All options on table: US warns North Korea after missile launch Apr 05, 2017 07:53 AM Business North Korea fires missile into Sea of Japan Apr 05, 2017 07:40 AM Business Asian stocks drift sideways as Trump-Xi meeting approaches Apr 05, 2017 07:28 AM Business Asia stocks down as investors seek safe havens before Trump-Xi meeting Apr 04, 2017 08:09 AM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sheikh Hasina Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Arvind Kejriwal Yogi Adityanath Home Academy Are we preparing our kids for 21 century? Raghav Podar Shares5 Raghav Podar | Mon, 10 Apr 2017-08:00am , DNA India’s education system, a la most East and South Asian education systems is centred around the pursuit of the Holy Grail of Marks. Education in its most fundamental sense, is only about learning, yet education systems focus most of their efforts on the students achieving the best marks. While tests are an important barometer to judge the level of understanding of the student, they are supposed to be diagnostic in nature. They are meant to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the individual child, rather than pigeonhole children into different labels of intelligent/average/weak or whatever the latest jargon being used by some institutions to label children lately. The current focus on this rat race of getting the best marks, to secure a seat in the toughest-to-get-into college, which is misunderstood as the child’s sure shot way to success in life, needs to change. Even Sundar Pichai in his recent interview at IIT Kharagpur echoed the sentiment that getting into a top college isn’t a necessary pre-requisite to success in life. In the 21st century, the world economy does not reward you any more for what you know. Why? Because with Google Baba, we all have almost infinite information at our fingertips. You are never going to know more than Google. The world economy doesn’t reward you for what you know, but for what you can do with you know, and how you apply the knowledge that you have! In the west, human jobs have already started being replaced by robots, which are more intelligent, efficient and can work 24 hours, at far less cost. Children in school today will be retiring in the 2070s– 2080s. We have no clue what the world will look like next year (which is quite evident from recent global election and referendum results), yet we are preparing them for their lives decades ahead. The pace of change is staggering, the uncertainty is fascinating. The current education system is one which was conceived and designed many decades ago, to suit the needs and requirements of students passing out at that time. Most young adults at that time either went to the farm, or factory. Today, the number of different jobs that exist is more than ever before in history. The top 10 most in-demand jobs in 2010 did not even exist in 2004. We are preparing kids for jobs that don’t even exist today. They will be solving problems that we don’t even know are problems yet; using technologies that haven’t even been invented yet! What does all this mean? The job of education systems, more so now, than ever before is to equip our children with the life skills that will be required to tackle any of life’s challenges head on. The most important skill sets that will be required in the 21st century are: Communication Exploration Teamwork Problem Solving Critical Thinking Creativity Curiosity Innovativeness Resilience Collaboration It’s about time our education system sits up and takes note, and makes the necessary adjustments to cope with, and tackle the challenges of the exponential times we live in.

Neither platform maker was happy and the likes of Samsung and ASUS backed out for fear of earning their ire. This gave other smaller players, like Chuwi here, to thrive in a market very few dared. The Chuwi Hi10 Plus represents one of the latest of such devices, combining the power of Windows 10 with the mobility of Android in one affordable package. But how does that tempting promise perform in practice? We take the Chuwi Hi10 Plus for a whirlwind tour to find out. Taming expectations Let’s address the elephant in the room from the start. This is no Microsoft Surface 3. It is almost too easy to compare the two, especially considering how similar they are underneath. But one is a $499 device and the other is $199. And while there could be some miracles like that in the smartphone world, it’s admittedly harder to pull off when talking about tablets, especially 2-in-1 PCs. When you put your price that low, something has to give. That being said, you will have to take the Hi10 Plus for what it is: a dual boot Windows and Android tablet with a dirt cheap price tag. It is going to be comparable to some Intel Atom tablets, yes even the Surface 3, but it is its own beast. Keep that in mind and you might be in for a surprise. Hard numbers Disclaimer aside, let’s get down to business. And by that, I mean those specs that no tech review would be complete without. Here is a quick rundown of those hardware bits that make up the brain and muscles of the Hi10 Plus. • Operating System: Windows 10, Android 5.1 • CPU: Intel Atom x5-Z8350, 1.44 GHz quad-core • RAM: 4 GB • Storage: 64 GB, microSD up to 128 GB • Display: 10.8 inches, 1920×1280 • Main Camera: 2 MP • Secondary Camera: 2 MP • Connectivity: 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth, USB-C, micro USB, micro HDMI, • Battery: 8,400 mAh • Dimensions: 276.4 x 184.8 x 8.8 mm • Weight: 686 g Those who keep tabs on all kinds of tablets might see some familiar figures here. The Intel Atom x5 series seems to be favorite of budget Windows 10, and some Android, tablet makers. In fact, the Hi10 Plus’ x5-Z8350 is just a notch lower than the x5-Z8550 found inside the Lenovo Yoga Book. It is, sadly, a class below the Intel Atom x7 series, like what the now practically obsolete Surface 3 has. And speaking of the Surface 3, this is where it’s hard not to make comparisons. In almost every aspect except one or two, the Chuwi tablet has something comparable. 10.8-inch 1920×1280 3:2 screen? Check. Nearly the same dimensions? Check. One key difference is that the Hi10 Plus comes with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. On the Surface 3, the 4 GB RAM configuration is paired with 128 GB of storage. The other difference is that the Chuwi 2-in-1 has 2 megapixel cameras, front and back, that are not worth writing home about. The display is clear but isn’t exactly the brightest. That, plus the very reflective surface, makes it painful to use outdoors. The speakers aren’t any better. They sound rather flat and volume levels won’t be enough to fill a small room. You’ll most likely prefer to reach for headphones for all but the shortest sound clips or videos. Design In terms of form factor, the Chuwi Hi10 Plus is more like the ASUS Transformer than a Microsoft Surface. But still, unlike the ASUS 2-in-1s, the price only covers the device itself and doesn’t include any keyboard cover or dock. In essence, the Hi10 Plus is really just a tablet that happens to be designed with a keyboard attachment in mind. The Hi10 Plus definitely looks premium and its solid and rather hefty build reinforces that impression. The back is plastic though painted with a metal finish to make it look more premium than it really. The sides, however, are metal and the chamfered edges might cut into your palm if you hold it long enough. Not that you will want to, given its weight. On the back, you have nothing but the required brand and legal markings. While there technically is no camera bump, the way the back curves towards the edges leaves apart of the camera sticking out. And odd design and an accident waiting to happen. Most of the sides are bare. The right (or bottom, depending on how you hold it) has a lone speaker grille. The top (or right) has the power button and volume rocker only. In stark contrast, the left edge is very busy. You have all the physical ports and slots there, in addition to the second speaker grille. You have a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a micro HDMI port, a microSD card slot, a micro USB port and, surprisingly, a USB-C port. The last is where the Hi10 Plus draws power and the micro USB is used solely for data. It’s reassuring to know that you can charge the device while still have room for any external storage or peripheral. A full USB port would have been nice, but at this size, it would have been nearly impossible. On the bottom edge lies the only proof that the Hi10 Plus is meant to more than just a tablet. There you have pogo pins and magnetic holes where keyboard accessories can snugly fit in. Unlike with the Surface, however, a keyboard isn’t really an integral part of the tablet’s experience Dual boot There have been cheap Windows 10 tablets bearing these specs, and some odd Intel-powered Android tablets, too. What makes the Chuwi Hi10 Plus special, of course, is that it combines both for the low, low price of one. On one side, you have Windows 10 Home. On the other, you have a pretty vanilla Android 5.1. If you’ve ever used a dual boot Windows/Android device before, you’ll be familiar with how this works. From Windows, you click on an icon on the desktop to start the process, which will reboot the tablet straight into Android. On Android, the action to boot into Windows is in the Quick Toggles menu. Sadly, the dream of a near seamless way to run Windows and Android side by side died with the Samsung ATIV Q. Rebooting from one OS to another takes anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds. And that depends on whether Windows won’t be stuck with installing an update before rebooting. Suffice it to say, don’t rely on it too much when you’re in a hurry. This fine mutual co-existence, however, has some caveats. As mentioned, the device only has 64 GB of storage which has to be shared between the two platforms. And Windows is not known to be efficient when it comes to storage space. Fortunately, Chuwi did the sensible thing and give most of that space to Windows. Even then, of the roughly 45 GB of space, only half of that is available to the user. That leaves Android with a little over 10 GB of room, only 6 GB of which can be used by the user. It definitely feels rather suffocating. You can expand the storage with a microSD card, but be warned. While the Hi10 Plus can, in theory, support a 128 GB card, you have to be careful how you format it. Android is very picky and won’t read cards formatted as NTFS. Even those using exFAT might be rejected. Your best bet would be to reformat the card (after backing it up, of course) using Android’s own service. This all raises the question of what benefit a dual boot system has, given the constraints above. There will always be those who find both Windows and Android to be inadequate for certain use cases and wished they had both without really needing to have two devices. Chuwi’s Hi10 Plus and its other tablets are the answers to that with. Although improving, Windows still isn’t great at touch screens and mobile apps while Android, at least version 5.1 Lollipop, has a long way to go in productivity. There is one rather unfortunate note about this dual boot setup that would have addressed that last bit about Android. Earlier units of the Hi10 Plus actually used Remix OS, a custom Android experience that has been fine-tuned for desktops, laptops, and mini PCs, with its movable windows and desktop interface. In short, it’s perfect for the Hi10 Plus. It seemed, however, that stability issues forced Chuwi to revert to a plain Android ROM. While some might prefer a “pure” Android experience, Android 5.1 is woefully old and lacks Nougat’s split-screen multi-tasking. As such, while the Android side might be great for a touch screen tablet experience, it might fall short in laptop form. Performance Remember that part about taming expectations? This is where it might be needed the most. Intel’s Atom platform has never been about performance. It was supposed to be Intel’s response to ARM’s dominance in the mobile market, offering a “power efficient” SoC for Intel phones and tablets. In practice, however, it failed to deliver even on that. The one things that Atom had going for it was that it opened the doors for fanless and cheap mobile devices. Not that the Atom x5-z8350 is terrible, mind. It has enough power and “energy efficiency” for going beyond menial computing tasks. Document editing, web browsing, and the like are easy peasy. So, too, are videos, since you won’t be going beyond FHD quality anyway. With some careful planning and configuration, you can do even more taxing productivity tasks. The x5-z8350 can even handle some very constrained programming on the sides. You can, however, forget about most PC or Android gaming, unless they’re on the casual side. Or unless you’re willing to dial down your game’s settings to low. Multi-tasking is helped by the 4 GB RAM. Strangely, Chuwi clocked that down to 1066 MHz, even if it’s capable of 1600 MHz. That is part of its power-saving measures but at the expense of performance. You can clock it back up in the BIOS settings and most users who have done so have reported no negative consequences other than a shorter battery life. Despite the 8,400 mAh battery, Chuwi can only promise 4 to 6 hours of battery life on average. Again, Windows isn’t exactly known for being a battery saver. Android might fare a bit better in this regard. Chuwi advertises quick charging, though that is mostly thanks to the use of USB-C and not through any technology on Intel’s or Chuwi’s end. And even then, 5 hours to fully charge the giant battery might not sound so quick. Accessories Because the Chuwi Hi10 Plus is at a low, low price of $200, you might end up with enough room in the budget for extras. Depending on what you want to use the tablet for, these may or may not be essential to your overall experience. The good news is that they are also at the fraction of the price of comparable accessories for other tablets. That said, some of them might disappoint you. The $20 Active Stylus, for example, is advertised to allow you to write or draw on the tablet like on paper. If you presume this would be like the Microsoft Surface Pen or the Samsung S-Pen, you’d be dead wrong. This stylus would be more like an Adonit Jot Dash that has a very fine and solid tip for more precise input. It isn’t, however, pressure sensitive, just like Adonit’s stylus. It needs to be recharged as well, but any micro USB cable would do. Thankfully, no silly stylus jutting out of your tablet. You have to press a button on the clip to turn it on and press and hold to turn it off. A helpful LED light tells you if it’s on. And in case you forget to turn it off, it will do so by itself in a few minutes. Then there’s the $57 Docking Keyboard, which is exactly just that, a docking keyboard. It has two full-sized USB ports to extend the Hi10 Plus’ connections, LED indicators for power and Caps Lock, and that’s pretty much it. There is no backlighting here. No extra battery or storage either. At 635 g, it weighs nearly as much as the tablet itself but has barely anything to show for it. It does keep the tablet turned laptop from toppling over, but it would have been nice if it had a battery inside as well. Despite the wide space, the chiclet keys are small and cramped. They do have a good amount of travel that typists look for. The touchpad is plastic with a matte texture. You can click on the left or right area for mouse clicks but the touchpad also supports multi-finger gestures as well. There’s also a Keyboard Cover that mimics the functionality of the Surface Type Cover but uses a tri-fold ala the Apple Smart Keyboard to prop up the tablet in a single angle. It also connects magnetically to the Hi10 Plus, so there’s no need for charging and no need to worry about Bluetooth. This case costs $37. Wrap-up It might be too easy to say “you get what you pay for”, but too often that’s used pejoratively. In the case of the Chuwi Hi10 Plus, however, that is far from the whole picture. You’d be hard pressed to find a $200 tablet that has “good enough” specs and ran Windows 10 and Android side by side. It has the combination of hardware and software to get you through your day, be it work or play, and, with the right accessories, you can turn what is a consumption device into a creation device. Within limits, of course. Sure, Chuwi could have perhaps done better in some regards, but that would have changed the entire message of the Hi10 Plus. One of the great things about Chuwi is that it actually has a product for almost any tier and budget. And it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. There are more capable devices, even dual boot 2-in-1 tablets, but for a higher price as well. But if you’re strapped or cash and need a single device that performs both simple Windows and Android duties, the Chuwi Hi10 Plus isn’t going to disappoint you that much.

Android Pay support for a bank enables users to register their cards via the app for use on supported devices and smartwatches. Back in the day, Google Wallet supported any card, so many were disappointed to learn that Android Pay would need to work with their specific bank.

LG knows this and has never shied away from trying new ideas. It was one of the first companies to make use of curved screens, and last year, it released an insane smartphone with a "magic slot" that let you plug in accessories, including a camera and a speaker. The phone was a disaster. It was poorly reviewed, and few people bought it. This year, LG is hitting the reset button with the G6, a modern flagship with all the essentials and not much else. All photos: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo At first glance, the G6 makes a hell of a good impression. It has a large, beautiful 15cm display that takes up nearly the entire front of the screen — no garish bezels here. The aluminium build is sturdy and satisfying, and under the hood, it packs quality hardware that can go toe-to-toe with the best phones out there. One thing you'll notice right away is the phone's unusual dimensions. This can be explained by the display's weird 18:9 aspect ratio. It makes it a little wider and longer than other popular smartphones. That's not bezel. Its extra screen because the video is a different aspect ratio that the display. The difference becomes most obvious when you're watching videos on YouTube or Netflix, where most videos literally can't fill the screen, resulting in two borders along the edge of the phone. Some newer shows, like Stranger Things, have been filmed in 18:9 and look phenomenal on the 18:9 display. Yet most videos are shot in the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio, meaning the video is not wide or long enough to fill the LG G6's larger screen. In my week testing the device, I never really got used to the borders. But I could get really used to the G6's two rear cameras. They're two 13-megapixel cameras on the back that are good enough to compete with top phones like the iPhone 7 Plus and recently announced Samsung Galaxy S8. One of the rear cameras has a 125-degree wide-angle lens that captures a wider vista than even the iPhone 7 Plus (which maxes out at 75.4 degrees), making it easier to capture scenery or make sure that your friends don't get cut out of sloppy, late night group photos. The wide-angle camera adds a huge amount of creative freedom and is something that most amateur phone photographers will really appreciate. There's also a wide angle lens in the front, meaning you can take better selfies with more people or in front of an interesting backdrop. During a side-by-side comparison to the dual rear camera equipped iPhone 7 Plus, we noticed that the G6 doesn't switch between the two lenses quite as fast. There's about a second delay on the LG phone. The iPhone switches instantly. This probably won't be a big deal for most users, but anyone who needs to switch between lenses quickly could be frustrated by this brief lag. This is normal focal length. It's a tighter shot with smaller field of view. (Image: Michael Nuñez/Gizmodo) This is wide-angle focal length. It has a much larger field of view. (Image: Michael Nuñez/Gizmodo) The inclusion of a wide-angle lenses on the front and back of the phone makes the G6 better (and honestly more fun) than Google's own flagship Pixel at taking photos. It gives you more options for capturing, and the image sensor is roughly the same level of quality as the Pixel. I found the camera to be responsive and excellent for framing shots. It's also important to note that neither the Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S8+, the phone's chief Android competitors, feature wide-angle lenses on the front or back of the phones. Beyond the cameras, the phone doesn't have a whole lot of gimmicky features. It runs on LG's custom version of Android and comes with only a couple of pre-installed apps, like Square Camera — an Instagram knock-off that lets you take square photos or even stack two square photos on top of each other in a feature called Match Shot. People will most likely ignore or even uninstall this app because there are plenty of other alternatives. The LG G6 is also the first non-Pixel flagship to run Google Assistant. This comes as a welcome surprise to anyone who's wanted to use the service but is reluctant to buy the Pixel because of its clunky hardware. Personally, I don't find Google Assistant to be very helpful right now — but it will get better as more people use it, and it has the potential to be helpful in the near future. It also works, essentially, the same way that Google Now does, feeding you information it thinks you'll find important or useful. There are no other gimmicks built into the LG G6. No experimental features, nothing overly ambitious, and definitely no features that are best in class. The G6 is an oversimplified phone to make up for last year's over-complicated disaster. LG has pared down the phone so much that it's really nothing special. This is a no-nonsense flagship with all the essentials and nothing more. For the price, you're probably better off purchasing any of the other flagships on the market. They all have more features, and equal or better hardware. The iPhone and Google Pixel will also receive software updates sooner. And for only a few hundred dollars more the the Galaxy S8 will give you awesome extras including an iris scanner, artificially intelligent assistant, quality headphones, and much more. This time LG played it safe — but it feels too safe. READ ME The 18:9 screen ratio puts a border around most popular videos Where are the extra features?

Meanwhile every other carrier is busy pushing the arguably better value of the S8/S8+ Reply 0 welbot @welbot Apr 10, 2017, 3:39pm I'm glad to see phone makers putting out "dull" phones. i don't use my phone for browsing the net or anything fancy. Just calls, text, and snapping the occasional picture. The less bloated they are, the better for me! I currently have a G4 which I inherited from my dad when he went up to a Galaxy 7 edge. Prior to that, I had a Galaxy S1! First thing I did when I got the G4, was uninstall all the rubbish that came pre-installed that I'll never use. Then I unfortunately discovered the limitations of Kit-Kat with the way it handles internal memory/SD cards :\ I had to root the phone and install Xposed just to be able to install a game. So glad that the new versions of Android allow you to merge SD's with internal memory, cos that was the most ridiculous way to handle things. I'm not in any hurry to upgrade, but this would certainly be a decent option for me from what I'm hearing! Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

News sign-up YouTube imposes ad limit on small channels News, 10 April 2017 Topics YouTube GLOBAL: YouTube, the Google-owned video platform that has been under intense pressure over the placement of ads on inappropriate sites, has now said it will not allow ads on channels that have fewer than 10,000 lifetime views. The company announced in a blog post last week that it is changing some of the terms of its YouTube Partner Program (YPP) to build in extra safeguards for advertisers. It also wants to crack down on the number of channels that try to make money by re-uploading original content created by others. As a result, YouTube has raised the threshold that creators have to meet to join the YPP. "We will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10k lifetime views. This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel," wrote Ariel Bardin, YouTube’s VP of Product Management. "It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10k views up until today will not be impacted." Bardin added that YouTube will soon introduce a review process for new creators who want to join the YouTube Partner Program. It will mean that any creator hitting 10,000 lifetime views on their channel will have their activity checked against YouTube's policies. "If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules," he explained. Time will tell whether the reforms are enough to placate advertisers who, for a long time, have been calling for more brand safety in digital advertising. But, as TechCrunch pointed out, YouTube's imposition of a 10,000 threshold should weed out many videos that are obscure or offensive, while also making it likely that fewer videos would require review by human staff.

Are you periodically forced to buy a new laptop because the technology – hardware or software – in your current laptop is no longer supported even though it’s fully functional? Workers processing electronic waste in Shantou City, Guangdong Province, China. Entry of new technologies into the market contribute to massive e-waste across the world. Photo - EPA The Microsoft Windows operating system is estimated to power about 90% of world’s personal computers today. Newer versions of Windows appear every couple of years or so. Once that happens, many applications, such as your favourite web browser, rush to support the new version. Over a few years, these applications move away from supporting older versions to the same extent as the new one. Google Chrome is a case in point. When it’s running on Windows Vista (a much older Windows operating system) on my laptop, it no longer receives updates from Google — that support has been removed. Microsoft has itself stopped support for Windows Vista. Another example: I have found it very difficult to find an external hard drive – the device you use to back up your data, photographs of family and friends and songs – that works with my fully functional eight-year-old Windows Vista-based laptop. Almost all easily available external hard disks now support some of the more recent versions of Windows. So, how can consumers like me get the required hard disk? The answer is that they probably can’t. Product lifespan Companies design products with an expected lifespan, and they plan technical support and product warranty accordingly. A good rule of thumb to estimate a product’s lifetime is to look at its warranty period, as it can help you guess how often its manufacturer would be launching new products. Apple provides a one-year limited warranty and launches a new iPhone almost every year. After the initial warranty period, you need to purchase an additional warranty for extended coverage. The warranty period is clearly not the actual expected lifetime of a product. But it does mean that if you don’t care for your device, you will be paying extra money for additional coverage in the best case scenario, or buying a new and more expensive device in the worst. After a few years, even your caring attitude will inevitably reach a point of diminishing returns because no matter how functional the hardware is, the software technology driving it evolves much faster. Reduced choice New products are seen as new choices but, unless you have the financial means, you actually have fewer choices. Using your older device constrains you because of the limited support for its hardware and software. And what happens when your old device runs into issues, even if they are minor ones? Since there’s no more support available for the hardware or the software, your options are to upgrade, or look for people with the skills to repair it. An upgrade can be expensive and the people with the necessary skills may simply not exist. Technical repair skills have sadly been on the decline. This is not just the case in the consumer electronics industry, where the US Bureau of Labour Statistics predicts a decline of 2 percent from 2014 to 2024 for electrical and electronics engineering technician jobs, but also in the automobile and other industries. This is a trend seen across in advanced economies. Effect on purchasing power It’s one thing to have purchasing power limited by financial means and another entirely to have it curtailed because of reduced choices. While companies may claim that user expectations change market dynamics, it’s also true that many companies make tireless efforts through advertisements and promotions to influence user expectations. Some actually try to set user expectations. The latter is typified in the idea that “customers don’t know what they want”, which is eschewed by many because of Steve Jobs. The goal of this idea is essentially to manoeuvre customers to satisfy a company’s goals. When a large customer base moves towards a particular set of products, a company need not continue offering support for pre-existing products. Many people may not need the new product, but they sell in the name of technological ‘evolution’ even when this evolution is nothing more than feature enhancement. Contribution to e-waste In countries where a service provider also sells consumer devices on contract, reduced choices may not be apparent. Take for example, smart phones such as Apple’s iPhone, which are sold by mobile carriers. With the launch of every a new iPhone, customers may have the option to upgrade to the latest device at a cost. Many see this as an opportunity to get a new device every few years. Some of the devices discarded as a result may find their way through vendor buyback programs, others may be recycled or refurbished versions in certain markets – but mostly without any warranty. Many others still, though, find their way to a landfill and thus contribute to electronic waste. Even if we give consumers the choice to not contribute to e-waste or delay it as much as possible, will they be likely to exercise it? Probably not, given the rate of technological evolution. Devices discarded because of a lack of technical support (like my laptop) are likely to find their way to landfills. A lot of the technological evolution in consumer electronics market today is not trying to solve a pressing need. Rather, it’s trying to fulfil desires, not all of which are innately human. And, in the process, it is reducing the choices we have. The author is a Research Scientist in Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.

Every time you check it, you’re pulling the lever to see if you get a reward.    At least that’s how former Google product manager Tristan Harris sees it. This week on 60 Minutes, he tells correspondent Anderson Cooper that Silicon Valley programmers are engineering your phone and its apps to make you check them more and more. Take Snapchat. It’s the app that teens rank as “most important social network,” according to a Piper Jaffray report, and it’s keeping teens hooked by design. Snapchat’s “streaks” feature shows the number of days in a row that two people have traded photos, and the anxiety of breaking a streak is real. “And so you could ask when these features are being designed, are they designed to most help people live their life?” Harris says. “Or are they being designed because they’re best at hooking people into using the product?” Psychologist Larry Rosen says technology really does wreak havoc on anxiety levels. He and his team at California State University Dominguez Hills have found that when people spend time away from their phones, their brain signals the adrenal gland to produce a burst of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol triggers a fight-or-flight response to danger, and while it may have made primitive man hyperaware of his surroundings for safety, today it compels us to check our phones. “Eventually your goal is to get rid of that anxiety, so you check in,” Rosen says.  Play Video 60 Minutes Overtime When smartphones become a teen's drug of choice Anderson Cooper speaks with two teens in a treatment center in Malibu who realized: It's their phone they're hooked on. Cooper and the 60 Minutes team found that teens are among the most susceptible to phone anxiety. “The early science suggests that heavy users of technology, of smartphones, for example, become very anxious when they’re not using the technology,” says 60 Minutes producer Guy Campanile in the video above. “Teenagers already are the most anxious people you’re ever going to meet, so when you toss into that mix a device that, when they’re not using, makes them anxious, it just ratchets everything up three or four levels.” Cooper and Campanile went to Paradigm Malibu, a treatment center for teens having emotional and substance abuse issues. The two teens at Paradigm they spoke with realized their phone use had become a problem. One estimated that, before treatment, she had been using her phone six to seven hours a day. After Paradigm took her phone away, she didn’t know what to do with her hands at first, she told Cooper. “This is a constant stimulation device,” Campanile says of smartphones. “And what the therapist told us in regards to the teenagers, is that we as creatures need time just to do nothing. Do nothing.” In fact, doing nothing is what initially made Cooper start thinking about his own phone issues. He reported a 60 Minutes piece about mindful meditation last year and, as part of the reporting process, Cooper was forced to give up his phone during a mindfulness retreat. That experience helped him realize the extent to which his phone was preventing from being “present” in his life “This is very real to me,” he tells 60 Minutes Overtime in the video at the top of the page. “This is something I am wrestling with as well. I’m just on this hamster wheel of running, running, running, and checking messages and all this stuff.” Cooper admitted to feeling low-grade anxiety when he’s separated from his phone for any length of time, and he says he sometimes feels his phone ringing when it’s not. That sensation is what Rosen calls “phantom vibrations” — tingling neurons that have nothing to do with our actual phones buzzing. “Even if your phone’s not in your pocket, you still believe it’s your phone,” Rosen says. “That’s how powerful this device has become in our lives.” Because many people use their phones as alarm clocks—and then immediately check their phones on waking up—Cooper says it’s no wonder the devices have such a hold on us. “The first several minutes of your day are defined by what pops up on the screen,” Cooper says. “And there’s tremendous power in that.” How can we find a better balance with our smartphones? Cooper says it’s important to realize that your phone may not love you as much as you love your phone. “It boils down to how individuals, and also parents and kids, educate themselves about the power of these devices,” Cooper says. After all, apps are often a delivery system for ads aimed directly at the user, and companies can tell a lot about who is watching. Ramsay Brown, a co-founder of the startup Dopamine Labs with a background in neuroscience, says companies like Snapchat are delivering content—and money to advertisers—better than television ever could. “Snapchat, in all of its little content, knows exactly what you’re looking at and exactly how many seconds you looked, when you clicked away, and they’re meticulously recording every behavior you’re performing,” Brown tells Cooper. “And then they can hand it back to NBC or CBS or ABC and say, hey, that little piece of content you did, here’s exactly who likes it, here’s exactly when they clicked it, and exactly when they lost interest, in ways that TV’s just not technologically equipped to do.” But not all those in Silicon Valley are trying to reel users in for as long as possible. Brown is now using his neuroscience education to create apps that break the phone obsession. And Tristan Harris is working to shift the Silicon Valley culture away from user engagement. He’s urging companies to think about how to change the attention economy into a “time-well-spent economy.” “I think a lot of this, it boils down to how individuals, and also parents and kids, educate themselves about the power of these devices,” Cooper says.  The video above was produced by Lisa Orlando, Ann Silvio and Will Croxton, and edited by Lisa Orlando, Will Croxton and Sarah Shafer Prediger.   © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started.

NEWSSenate minority to block 4 administration measures TECHNOLOGYDubai Derma showcases latest tech, skin care products Google creates highly accurate lip-reading software Ryan Thomas Namia December 4, 2016 12:45 pm TECHNOLOGY 1.5K 0 DUBAI – Researchers from Google’s AI division DeepMind and the University of Oxford have collaborated and used artificial intelligence to make the most accurate lip-reading software to date. According to a report by cbronline.com, the AI system, which was trained using almost 5,000 hours of TV footage from the BBC, contained a total of 118,000 sentences from the videos. The key contributions include a “Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell” (WLAS), a network that learns to transcribe videos of mouth motion to characters. In an article published by arix.org, the goal of the work was to recognize phrases and sentences uttered by a talking face, with or without the audio. DeepMind stated that unlike previous works that have focused on recognizing a limited number of words or phrases, they tackle lip reading as an open-world problem – unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. The same media report added that the AI was trained on shows which aired during the period between January 2010 and December 2015, and later tested its performance on programs between March and September of this year. The lip reader was only able to decipher less than one-quarter of the spoken words, whilst the WLAS model was able to decipher half of the spoken words. Based on the report, citing the News Scientist, Ziheng Zhou at the University of Oulu, Finland, said that it was a big step for developing fully automatic lip-reading systems. “Without the huge dataset, it’s very difficult for us to verify new technologies like deep learning,” he added. In its summary, the architecture of the WLAS model surpassed the performance of all previous work on standard lip reading benchmark datasets, and demonstrated that visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance even when audio is used.  Facebook Comments Website Comments mike tyson March 6th, 2017 Reply z1SL9Y Really appreciate you sharing this article.Thanks Again. rasen schneiden March 6th, 2017 Reply A big thank you for your blog article.Really looking forward to read more.

LG G6 review: A breath of fresh air David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 9:35am PDTMar 28, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares207 G6 News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life 6 Storage, wireless, and reception 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance and stability 10 Software 11 Value 12 Conclusion If the G5 was the low watermark for LG's mobile division, you might think there was only really up to go for LG in 2017. The G6 can feel like a self-fulfilling prophecy that way: the narrative around the G5 was almost universally negative, and the idea that 2017 would yield a "comeback" product from LG seemed to become a given. After all, it was obvious what LG did wrong last year, so how could they not address these issues? At the same time, we often find ourselves saying tech companies make a habit of poor product decisions year after year, so it's never quite a sure thing that a new gadget really will check the very-obvious-to-us boxes we've communally decided are so important. With that in mind, LG does seem to have had its ear to the ground with the G6, iterating and changing things that clearly irked or concerned would-be customers. Waterproofing, a more premium look and feel, upgraded cameras, more efficient use of space (bezels), good battery life - these are things that, to smartphone enthusiasts, sound so terribly obvious as ways to up your product's appeal. They're the areas where LG has focused, I would argue, and the result is a phone that fundamentally is much more palatable than the awkward G5, even if the G6 isn't what I'd call perfect. (In fact, the G6 can be fairly flawed at times.) But if you were hoping that LG would show up with a competent, modern smartphone in 2017, I think the G6 will do the trick. It's not the kind of phone that immediately strikes you as to why it works, but it does. The Good Display I'm loving the wider (longer?) screen, and LG's IPS LCD looks as good as ever. This works for me. Battery Good battery life, if not exceptional. If you're in the US, you get the bonus of wireless charging. Ruggedization LG claims the G6 stands up to a drop pretty well, and it's also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. Compact The G6 has a screen equivalent in surface area to a normal 5.5" phone, but it's very noticeably smaller than one. Camera I think most people will really like the G6's cameras. I wasn't the biggest fan, but there's no denying they produce very social media-friendly results. There are also two of them on the back. Premium This feels like the "premium" LG phone we've been asking for. It's nice. It looks good in black (but kind of bad in the two other colors, if I'm honest). The Not So Good Battery While the battery life is solid now, it's not amazing, and I think a screen of this size warrants a bit more battery just as a future-proofing measure. 3500 or 3600mAh would have seemed more appropriate. Storage 64GB should be standard on a $650+ phone in 2017. If OnePlus does it for $200 less than that, LG can do it. Camera I don't like LG's image processing, it destroys image detail and the photos look bad on large monitors, even if they look great on the phone's screen. Software aesthetic LG doesn't make Android any harder or more annoying to use, but this is The Ugly Duckling of smartphone themes. Android 7.0 We should be launching with 7.1, please. Design and materials If you're considering the G6, let me save you some time right now on which color to choose: black. Don't like black? Still get the black one. Really want a white phone? Get the black one. Think the silver looks flashy? Buy black. Only the black G6 really does proper justice to the small bezels around the screen, because it's the only one with black bezels. They just kind of visually wash away when you're holding the phone. The dark gray aluminum frame blends in nicely, and while the glossy black finish on the back is fingerprint-prone, you can always use a case or skin to fix that. It has this sort of "stealth phone" look (thanks for that, Ryan) that really works for me. I also think it does a good job hiding the G6's rather ugly "surprised robot" face on the back of the phone. It's not as bad as it was on the G5 and V20, but, yeah. It's there, and the black version of the phone makes it the least apparent. Buy the black one. The silver and white versions of the G6 kind of ruin all the magic of that tiny bezel. The phone's material composition is glass sandwich, with a gently curved glass pane on the back, an anodized aluminum mid-frame, and a flat front glass panel. LG has tried to spin the flat screen as an ergonomic and durability choice, saying curved screens are harder to use (they are) and they're more fragile (they can be). LG even went as far as to say their phone is much less likely to crack from a drop impact than a device with a curved screen, claiming the design allows force to be distributed more evenly in the event of an impact. I'm not sure how much better it really is in that sense than any other flat phone, but hey, maybe there's something to it. Overall, I like the feel of the G6. With the compact size coupled with the fairly large display, the G6 feels right at home in your hand and your pocket without seeming cramped to actually use. I find it very hard to go back to "normal" 5-inch smartphones anymore, and while the G6's 5.7" screen isn't actually as large as a 16:9 panel with the same diagonal, the added vertical space definitely helps for reading, typing, and web browsing. It's absolutely enough. Compared to the 5.5" Google Pixel XL, the G6 is much more one-handed use friendly - though it is a fair bit more slippery. Despite having screens of near identical surface area, the G6 is much more compact than the Pixel XL. This is a phone that has a premium quality to it, and I think that's a story best told by the minimal bezel on the front - it has a slightly futuristic vibe that gives the G6 a little something beyond your average glass and metal smartphone visually. Again, I maintain this is only true with the black version: I find this phone kind of ghastly in silver. But it feels very well put together and, in that sense, is a complete departure from the disjointed and strange G5. Waterproofing with an IP68 rating means the G6 doesn't just look the part, it can go for a swim and be no worse for wear. So not only does it look and feel better, it actually is better, too. I do have some ergonomic complaints. The volume keys sit too high on the body of the phone (which makes camera quick launches harder), and I'd prefer a traditional power key. I like to check my notifications without unlocking the screen. You could make the fingerprint reader key a custom button. Just a suggestion. Display LG's IPS panels have been a mixed bag over the years, but what I hear from fans of the brand is that they're generally well-liked despite some technical shortcomings. The G6's screen gets very bright, though in direct sunlight it really fares no better than a modern Super AMOLED panel. The intensely stark whites of LG's screens have their critics, me included, but some people prefer the more blue-ish whites because they give things a "cleaner," higher-contrast look. Colors are predictably oversaturated, but not annoyingly so, though there is no option to change the profile or white temperature. You can activate the "comfort view" on the lowest setting to get a more natural, albeit slightly yellow, white point. Confusingly, LG's blue light filter (comfort view) doesn't have an option to set automatic on and off times. Really? The screen has excellent viewing angles and neither of my test units has any appreciable light bleed around the edges (a problem last year on the G5). As to the 18:9 aspect ratio, I don't find it's really impacted the appearance or usability of any apps on the phone. Some very old apps may have an issue with the effective software aspect ratio (16.7:9 - excluding the nav keys), but LG allows you to set them to compatibility mode (16:9) or even extend them to full-screen (18:9) if you want. So that's nice - good thinking, LG. The screen is a clear focus on the G6, and it works. I like the extra vertical real estate and could definitely see myself buying a phone with a wider aspect ratio display in the future. There's benefit here, ergonomically and visually, and LG has made the case for me. Battery life The G6's 3300mAh battery may not sound like much when you're thinking about a 5.7" device, but you have to remember that the surface area of this panel is actually just a little bit greater than a 5.5" screen with a standard 16:9 aspect ratio like the one on the Pixel XL. So, the battery isn't large given the display's size, but it's not comically small, either. I found the G6's battery life to be above average, but not amazing. LG's automatic brightness is very, very conservative, and that probably helped things a bit. I reliably and consistently hit over four hours of screen-on time during normal usage, sometimes closing in on five. So, not as good as the Pixel XL, but within shouting distance. It's acceptable, just not remarkable. Quick Charge 3.0 is on board (LG is including a quick charger in the box), as is wireless charging (only in North America the USA), if that's something you want. I can understand leveling some criticism at LG for not fitting a larger cell here, though. A 10% boost in capacity would probably push the G6 into the 'very good' battery life column, as opposed to the 'just good' one. It's not what I'd call a deal breaker. The phone lasted long enough for me and I never felt like I was getting shortchanged on the longevity front, as opposed to the rather frustrating experience I had with the HTC U Ultra. Storage, wireless, and reception Storage is one place where the G6 falls short for me. Not only does it start at 32GB, that's your only option. There are no 64GB models being made available here in the US, and with rumors saying Samsung's Galaxy S8 will come with 64GB standard, that stings. I really would like to see all major smartphone vendors move to make 64GB the baseline for storage on a flagship phone. OnePlus can offer it at $440 - LG can't at over $200 more? My Verizon unit came with just over 19GB of room available out of the box. That's not much. There is a microSD slot, so you're not totally without options here. Still, it's one of those flaws I spoke of earlier: LG could have done better. Wireless performance has been fine for me on both the unlocked preproduction version of the phone I tested as well as the retail Verizon unit I received more recently for testing. Bluetooth reception has been just OK - it's not as bad as it is on the Pixel XL in my car, which will cut out even just sitting in the passenger seat at times - but it's not fantastic, either. For example, I can't keep a steady Bluetooth audio stream if the G6 is in my pocket (to be fair, my leg is resting against the transmission tunnel). Call quality has been fine and I have no signal issues to report at this time. Audio and speakers Most G6s sold across the globe will not feature LG's "Hi-Fi" Quad DAC and amplifier, but the standard Aqstic part from Qualcomm, which is fine. While not as powerful as the third-party solution LG will be using in some Asian countries, this really only matters if you're trying to drive very big or very high-impedance headphones, and shouldn't impact most people. I maintain that the audio from Qualcomm's DAC and amplifier combination hub is perfectly good, though I wouldn't mind a little more output for those times when I would like to wear my big over-ears. Quality-wise, though, it's still excellent. The G6's bottom-firing speaker is reasonably loud but pretty tinny, not quite as balanced as the speaker on my Pixel XL. It is noticeably more powerful - and loudness tends to be king on phone speakers. I still don't love the direction it's facing, as I don't on any phone with this configuration, but it's passable and by no means bad. Oh, and the G6 has a headphone jack, because LG doesn't hate you. Camera I have a feeling my sentiments about the G6's cameras will not echo many other reviewers. I don't like the G6's rear-facing cameras very much. Don't get me wrong, they can produce some very striking images with incredible contrast... but it's not real. LG's processing is so aggressive that when you zoom into full crop it's like somebody oil-painted your photo. This makes framing adjustments a real bear: you can't crop too close, otherwise the oil-painting effect becomes obvious, especially in low light. The photos also just don't look good on big screens a lot of the time because the processing becomes so much more apparent on a 27" monitor. Some people, though, love the cameras on this phone. They produce images that are instantly ready for social media, because they almost look a little filtered right out of the gallery. And when you're looking on a 5-6" smartphone screen, you're not going to notice the processing nearly as much. Take this shot of the beach taken with the wide angle camera. Looks solid, right? Take a peek at a slightly less forgiving crop. The rocks actually look like they were painted onto the picture. Come on. The HDR algorithm also halos like crazy around buildings, making photos look like they were run through the Snapseed gauntlet. It's just not to my taste. The G6's cameras, then, really depend on what your priorities are. For me? I'm still taking the Pixel every single day of the week over the G6 for the camera. Not even close in my book. The other party trick is obviously the wide-angle lens that allows you to capture a scene from a much different perspective than the standard camera. LG talks about its "zoom" feature but really that's kind of a load of crap - you're just digital zooming on the wide angle sensor until it effectively hits the point at which the narrow-angle lens sees from. LG says it's smoother and more natural than it was on the G5 and V20, and I guess it kind of is, but not enough that I'm really impressed by it at all. I just switch between the two cameras with the toggle - the zooming is nice for grandma, but not for anyone who knows to avoid digital zoom like the plague. Launch speed of the camera from sleep is good, about on par with the Pixel, in my experience - just double-tap the volume key and you're off. I do wish switching between the sensors was faster, though. The issue is that the phone remembers whichever one you were last using, and launches with that one selected. That's fine, but if I want to switch to the normal, narrow-angle lens camera, I'm wasting an extra few seconds to find the button, hit it, and then wait for the switch to happen. It's definitely a usability issue, and I know it's not one with an easy solution, but there it is. Previous Next Performance and stability While I would hesitate to say the G6 is Google Pixel levels of smooth or consistent, it's still a very quick phone. It doesn't have the almost manic rapidness of the OnePlus 3T, and the animations hang consistently more often than on the Pixel, but it's fast. I can definitely tell I'm not using a Samsung phone, I'll say that much. So, let's talk about that Snapdragon 821. It's not an 835. The Galaxy S8 will almost certainly have a Snapdragon 835. The G6 does not. This will upset people on the internet who tend to become upset about such things. If you are liable to be upset about this, by all means, rant. But it's not like LG had much choice in the matter unless they wanted to delay the G6's launch by several months, and it's not like the Snapdragon 821 is at all a bad chipset. We quite like it in the Google Pixel and OnePlus 3T. And let's not forget: the Pixel XL, which I still heartily recommend to almost everyone, is substantially pricier than the G6. If you have to have the newest processor, you're not going to buy this phone anyway, so it's kind of a moot point. If you don't care about that, I don't think the Snapdragon 821 in any way makes the G6 a worse product. Bug-wise, I haven't encountered any major issues, or really any minor ones that come to mind, either. The phone feels stable and I've not had any strange problems. Software I still take issue with some of LG's aesthetic modifications. Their UI is inconsistent visually, though they did finally drop that awful sea green teal color. But, that aside, they really don't mess with Android in many ways I'd call annoying. You have your standard quick settings titles, Nougat's bundled notifications, a comprehensible settings menu, and not too many unnecessary bloat apps (from LG, at least) or legacy features (Samsung) crowding things up. Once you throw on a custom launcher and ditch LG's not-good keyboard, you won't find that LG's changes to the software are going to come up too often. And that's a good thing. While not as light a hand as you'd find with something like Motorola's UI these days, LG's additions can be genuinely useful, allowing you to customize the theme, navigation bar, the aforementioned aspect ratio scaling for apps, and double-tap to wake the screen. There aren't nearly as many features as you'd find on a Samsung phone, but that's not necessarily bad - LG keeps the clutter relatively low. There really isn't that much to say about the software, if I'm honest, and I mean that in a positive sense. It feels like Android 7.0, albeit with some aesthetic and a few functional modifications here and there. Sure, you'll want to replace the launcher and the keyboard, but that's true of almost any smartphone not made by Google or Motorola these days, and it's hardly what I'd call a "problem."    LG has gone out of its way to talk up a few apps that it has "enhanced" for the new aspect ratio, but I can't recall a single time I ever noticed one - aside from the photo roll in the camera app. But there really haven't been any major changes made for the screen's new shape, that was definitely more marketing than substance. I mean, unless you count the rounded corners. Those are a thing. The one real complaint I do have about the software is the Android version: 7.0, at least on my US Verizon unit. LG told me, though there may have been some confusion around this, that the phone would launch with Android 7.1 by the time it went to retail. My retail unit is decidedly not running Android 7.1. I've asked LG about this and will update if I get a response. To be fair, LG is generally much quicker than Samsung about OS updates, so maybe we'll see a 7.1 update soon. Value The G6 will cost anywhere from around $650 to a little over $700 here in the US depending on your carrier or retailer, pretty much in line with the G5 last year. If you're going to pull the OnePlus 3T out, as I know some of you are dying to, obviously the G6 doesn't come out of a value analysis as the best smartphone bang for your buck. But that's true of essentially every $600+ smartphone, including Google's Pixels. Most people in the US buy their phones using installment plans now, and by that metric, the G6 costs a Very Average High-End Smartphone Amount of Money. Is it worth it? I think you'll need to consider your priorities. First, compared to what I'd call the benchmark high-end Android phone right now (Pixel XL), the G6 obviously has a few advantages. It's more ergonomic, it's actually waterproof, it costs less money, and it's going to be much more readily available (an area where Google is seriously dropping the ball). Dual cameras may be an advantage, if you really care, and while it's US-specific, wireless charging is something to consider. If you're looking a bit further out to smartphones yet-to-be-announced, that's a harder question. We don't know how much the Galaxy S8 will cost or exactly when it will launch, and we also don't know for sure just what all the changes are yet. I will admit, it's hard for me to see LG coming out of such a comparison on top, but I guess it could happen. Conclusion You may be thinking "That's it? That's the whole review?" (OK, maybe you aren't, but this one felt short to me when I was writing it.) But I think it's a good sort of 'that's it.' The G6 isn't the most exciting phone we're going to see in 2017, but it's a reassuringly competent improvement on the smartphone formula, at least for most people. You get more screen in a smaller package, two cameras on the back instead of one, respectable battery life, and software that doesn't make you want to tear your hair out. I remember when we would have been excited to have just one of these things (sorry, I don't mean to dig the "in my day" trope up), and even in 2017, I think we'll still see a handful of phones that don't get all of this right. Where could the G6 improve? I would have liked a larger battery, as we all know decent battery life today does not necessarily mean decent battery life one major Android platform update down the road. And batteries age. I still don't like LG's camera processing techniques, but realize I may be in the minority here. The software is not visually appealing, even if it doesn't do much to functionally impede the user experience. I'm also not a fan of the power button being the fingerprint reader; I'd prefer a separate power key on the side so I can check my notifications without unlocking the phone and thus having to hit the power key again to put it back to sleep. 64GB of storage should have been standard. And my last gripe is really to America's carriers, not LG: Stop changing the software just to change it (Verizon, I'm glaring at you in particular). Overall, though, there are few fundamental changes I would make to the G6. I think the constituent pieces are there: this is a good smartphone. I'm also naming it one of our editor's choice "Most Wanted" smartphones - LG did a lot right with the G6, and it's refreshing to see them build the kind of product I think we all knew they could.

Went with Platinum cuz F black. David Ruddock noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo HSidhu why? David Ruddock I cannot stand the platinum. Different strokes, I guess. The black looks super stealthy and really highlights the lack of bezel. HSidhu waiting for google's big phone :) illregal yeah, black looks good.. I just figured fingerprints n such. David Ruddock The silver one fingerprints aplenty. You'll get little respite, I'm afraid. wade_county lighter colored phones hide fingerprints better, i don't know what you're talking about MJ Fingerprints? That should be the least of your worries... Almost every time I see a phone without a case the scratches, corner dent(s), and/or cracked screen stick out more to me. LOL A case usually gives one more color options and look...no fingerprints. Please put a case on your new expensive phone. southerndinner Lol you got the ugly color steadymobb The platinum is nice, black is boring. Good choice. His opinion doesn't make it the right one! HSidhu First comment Maximiliano Barra E. I have a little question: normally, LG adjusts the DPI of its software to ridiculously high values ​​(640 in G3, for example). Can this be changed in the G6? David Ruddock Yep. And you can change it. I agree, it's annoying. I really, really need my 5 icons across on Google Now Launcher. EcE I haven't finished reading but regarding the checking your notifications part. You can't double tap the screen to turn it on anymore? sproc Yes but only since it is running version 7. But you can change any phone or tablet's DPI using adb. But with my LG phone it crashes the phone app if you go to contacts so kinda useless unless you have 7. Corey W. What do you mean by "version 7"? Do you mean Nougat? Also what is abd? Imparus Yes version 7 is Nougat, and adb is https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html sproc That phone is going :O in the one picture Valnac That's funny! i can't not see the face now! Corey W. I'll keep the G6 in mind...while I'm online preordering the S8 tomorrow BC Yeah, I feel like the LG G6 is pretty but lacks everything that would make me want it. If only the 64GB and Quad Dac made it into the LG G6, in addition to the wireless charging for the US Model. So Samsung, wins again through sheer incompetence on LG's part. As LG still hasn't learned their lesson. When the specs are released officially, I'll likely get the S8 or hold out for a Note-like device. Ghani Alta Pradita What an adorable phone! Almost decided to get one, but since my biggest concern was battery backup, then I decided to get redmi 4 prime (yes, a budget phone). But I couldn't be happier with this device, so satisfied with it's 14-15hours SOT :) My name is…. lol you must be joking. Right? RITE????!!??? Ghani Alta Pradita I can get easily 13h with 2 days standby. Mostly on wifi, and I don't play games at all :D https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e1c3de35bf3fd1d98d1aaeae6c8fcc72b94891ea105db82d1b2976a52dd17514.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/65d372ebd8c9ac1c8dfa6af441a6bf5b6f63eb6e29d55fc2a8dcd0c48b211ff4.jpg My name is…. Nobody cares how much SOT you get with your shitty redmi dude, how can you compare it to LG G6? xphyle Will the LG G6 feature boot loops? Mrd1 I think that is a standard for ALL lg phones. Period. I'll buy a paperweight from the dollar store and pocket the difference. Matthew Bowe I hear this all the time, but I've had every LG G phone in succession and never experienced any boot-looping. Other problems, absolutely, but never boot-looping. Joshua Hill It's not the percentage of occurrence but the fact that this problem has persisted for many generations and LG up to atleast the g5/v10 have yet to rectify the problem. They're warranty support has been terrible for people affected. I'd have to seriously consider paying for anything from a manufacturer with such a poor record. Probably safer to put you money on the roulette table ;) CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT!!!! Consumers don't normally do this if everything is fine. EcE Consider yourself lucky. I had them on a G3 and G. It took me about 8 months of fighting customer service to get a working phone I could sell online for cheap. I would never ever buy an LG phone again. Gusie Heard they are working on a boot loop API so you can call it from Google Home/Alexa TechGuy22 decent camera that's about it lol My name is…. lol Jack ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ vote: G6 or V20? Jack ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ rounded edge still feels a little awkward to me. I personally prefer v20 Dale Android 7.0 This is my biggest gripe about non-Google phones. Why are they releasing phones with 7.0? The initial releases of each major update always have a decent amount of bugs. It can't be that hard to make sure your new flagship has the latest software. My name is…. Go get a pixel versednj That's if you can get one. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's flying off the shelves so fast that HTC had to close a factory to save money they're constantly sold out. Droid22 Rumor was it would be updated at launch with 7.1 David Ruddock We'll see. I have a query out to LG. Andy J Yeah..... good luck with that...... David T Could you also ask when they'll push the security updates to the H850 Eur/UK? Presently on Nov2016 and they made a commitment to give out monthly updates or so I was led to believe. ike3232 whatever you do, do not buy an unlocked version. lg does not send android updates to those models. i learned the hard way. my unlocked unbranded rs988 g5 is stuck on marshmallow. Patruns Source of info please? ike3232 lol as an owner of this particular phone model rs988, i am the source of information MattPortland Oh so okay. Umm Patruns That just means yours did not work. derk p too bad LG lost me as a customer after a bootlooping nexus 5x and then hearing about all their previous devices with very high failure rates. Roy Yeah, same story with an LG G5 for me. I loved the phone until it bootlooped. Then, I grudgingly switch to an S6 (ok phone but I had been trying to get away from Samsung) when Verizon happened to not have replacement G5's on hand and offered the S6 in it's place. kamiller42 "(a problem last year on the G6)" Uh, what? LG, do not screw up the V30. Keep the quad DAC worldwide. It makes a difference, especially in high impedance mode. For those who don't have it, it's not hard to get the V20 into high impedance mode. You don't need high dollar cans to do it. Aural pleasure. supersanborn I hated the harsh post-processing in my G4. Surprised they haven't figured this out. Ztax I hated it in my G2... Matthew Bowe You can shoot in RAW if it's an issue. I like the post-processing. Kevin Davis A beautiful phone that is geographically crippled. Good luck, Lg. Drakenoid You can double tap the screen to wake it as a workaround to your fingerprint power button issue. Stocklone It should also have double tap status bar to lock like the G5. So no power button needed at all. Drakenoid Also @David Ruddock:disqus there's a typo in there: "(a problem last year on the G6)". I am guessing it should be G5. David Ruddock It has since been fixed. rjyanj That side by side with the Pixel really highlights how stupid the Pixel design is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ What's wrong with the Pixel design, other than the fact that you could land an Airbus A400M on the chin? Juniors234 You could host the next the next Olympics Games quite comfortably on its chin. Jennifercalvarez Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Fabrico Montini Why not trow in the winter games at the same time, that chin has multiple climates. Artem Russakovskii Well, that's pretty much it. "Despite having screens of near identical surface area, the G6 is much more compact than the Pixel XL." kjohnson04 Yep. Jay Leno has nothing on that chin. Ray I like the runway to be honest. Bit of extra room to hold the phone in landscape without interfering with the screen. wade_county The Pixel looks like a piece of shit next to it. jeyloux JAjajajajA james No removable battery? No deal I'll stick with my G5 until the end of time it seems Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ * Wireless charging, good * MST and LG Pay? If so, good * Cameras, good * 821 - no problem * Design, good * Software? Anything's better than schlock stock Android * 7.0 instead of 7.1? Don't care. * 32GB? Ehhhh... so so * LCD, ewww * LCD always on display using the main display? If so, battery sucking nightmare. It's not a bad phone at all, but I wouldn't buy it. james If it works anything like my G5 and I have to assume to does the always on display uses unnoticeable amounts of power for the benefit of having it Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From the pictures I've seen, it looks like it's the main display. But it also looks very dim. Maybe that's how they save battery. IMO the jury is out as to whether the dimness makes the AOD useful or useless. james It is the main display there is no secondary, and even with it dim it's still very easy to see drksilenc Black doesnt take any power to display only light does so just the notification takes power. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You're thinking of OLED. This display is LCD, which has a backlight that lights up the whole display, even the black part. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) LG pay? this is the first I'm hearing about it. I have the phone and no such app. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why I said "if so". The rumors were that it would have an MST payment ability like Samsung phones. MattPortland Samsung owns the MST tech. Jason Why aren't we seeing more phones with dual front-facing speakers like the Nexus 6P? I thought that was the way forward, but then it seems like the phones since then aren't getting them. Eclectech HTC got so much grief for the bezels that came with their speakers that they've basically stopped trying to be different. Robert Minneman No removable battery? Stupid move LG especially after the crappy manufacturing defect of the G4. Just jump on board with all the other dumbass companies going waterproof due stupid owners. Patruns Why is this an issue? Do you usually carry around fully charged spare batteries for your phone? Impulse_Vigil Some people do, I did when I had various HTC EVOs but seldom used them... Powering down and taking the case off was just too much of a hassle, it'd be somewhat better with the way Android saves your recently used stuff today but still... The other side to that argument is that batteries age, quickly when you're eating 1+ charge cycles every day... Being able to easily swap it means it'll remain useful for a good 3 years, whereas you might otherwise start feeling battery anxiety much earlier. I swapped the battery on my Nexus 5 to hold me over until the Pixel, but newer phones are tougher to get into. Just playing devil's advocate mind you. I'd like to see Google or whomever implement a battery replacement program. Joshua Hill When I had a galaxy S2 I did exactly that. I had the official slightly larger Samsung battery that made the back of the phone flush and carried around the original smaller battery in case of emergencies. I'm not sure why you asked the question??? I can think of only two reasons for a removable battery: 1) to replace the battery if it dies during use so you can continue to use your phone 2) to replace the battery after a year or two or whenever it stops holding a useful amount of charge. Adam Margeson Seriously. Back when I was using my Dell Axim X30, I would keep a spare battery with me, but the thing only lasted a short time and it was back when compatible chargers (out and about) weren't as plentiful. These days, if a phone can last 12 hours off the charger with ~3-4 Hr SOT, I'm fine. I have no qualms putting my phone on the charger when I get home for a little bit if I absolutely need to. If you're a travelling salesman or such, I can see spare batteries being something of a necessity, but even then, there are lots of USB based solutions out there. I'm sure ZeroLemon will probably make a battery case, too. Vivek Rameses I always wanted to try LG. This looks nice. Patruns Been happy with my LG Nexus 5 for over 3 years now. 1st phone I have seen that I would consider upgrading to. A lack of wireless charging phones as been the biggest issue holding me back. May not be a concern for many, but a deal breaker for me and the bride. I will look at the next Samsung, but their handling of the exploding washing machines has left a bad taste in my mouth and I am reluctant to buy another Samsung product. Phone_Addiction Only the usa model has wireless charging, the canadian model doesn;t. so, it's not all of North america that will have wireless charging. David Ruddock Interesting. I thought I heard otherwise. Benjamin Lehto So the Canadian model is missing Wireless charging and the Quad Dac? Phone_Addiction Yeah, sad really it's the same as what Europe is getting. Only certain Asian countries are getting quad DAC and only USA for wireless charging. It's really dumbass shit lg could pull. Benjamin Lehto Sigh, release a phone with all the same innards to every country. Sell one damn phone LG. Marty That's what I wish Sony would do with Xperia. Only the US is without an enabled fingerprint scanner. Phone_Addiction I mean if apple can do this and even a small company like oneplus can do it. Then it makes no sense why LG can't do this. Either all models have the features or none of them have it. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) can someone tell me why the want for Android 7.1? I don't see anything specific for it that's not just Pixel related stuff, emoji? launcher adjustments? why do we need 7.1 if we can't utilize 7.1? 7.0 seems just fine till the O release. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Android Nougat 7.1 Night Light Touch/display performance improvements Moves (Fingerprint swipe down gesture - opt-in) Seamless A/B system updates Daydream VR mode Developer features: App shortcuts / shortcut manager APIs Circular app icons support Keyboard image insertion Fingerprint sensor gesture to open/close notification shade Manual storage manager Intent for apps Improved VR thread scheduling Enhanced wallpaper metadata Multi-endpoint call support Support for various MNO requirements PCDMA voice privacy property Source type support for Visual Voicemail Carrier config options for managing video telephony Manual storage manager - identifies apps and files and apps using storage Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Night Light - are you talking about that night mode thing that each other manufacture of Android has put into their phones (blue light tint?) If so that's another one of those things that's been out for a while. Touch/display performance improvements - ....ok Moves (Fingerprint swipe down gesture - opt-in) - ok, I guess that's legit Seamless A/B system updates - I forgot about this one Daydream VR mode - This is hardware based, so there is no point in factoring that in (size and screen have to be compatible) App shortcuts / shortcut manager APIs - Nova, and I'm sure other launchers do this Circular app icons support - Masks have been doing this for a while on 3rd party launchers Keyboard image insertion - this is a feature? Keyboards have been doing this for a while, the one that comes to mind is Bitmoji. I know that it's a system function but the end user won't know a difference Fingerprint sensor gesture to open/close notification shade - mentioned above Manual storage manager Intent for apps - I am not sure what this does and it's to early for me to do more research Improved VR thread scheduling - again VR is a hardware thing, no point if you don't' support VR Enhanced wallpaper metadata - Dev function the end user won't notice Multi-endpoint call support - another thing I'm not going to look up atm Support for various MNO requirements - stuff like this is usually built into the skin on top of android PCDMA voice privacy property - Not gonna look up Source type support for Visual Voicemail - I guess that's cool Carrier config options for managing video telephony - another Android feature manufactures have been doing for a while that's being baked in Manual storage manager - identifies apps and files and apps using storage....wait that was mentioned above, I guess I dont' have to look it up afterall. Anyway Most Man. have a substitute for this that they've been using for years. All in all there are just a handful of things a OEM would even care about since most of the feature list are just things that they either already did themselves (think Samsung and LG) or stuff that they can't use/have their own version of (think VR, fingerprint stuff). Ultimately keeping 7.0 makes a lot of sense in most cases and just waiting for the O release. Keep in mind monthly security updates are still a thing, so regardless most big man. have to keep chipping at 7.0 for a while anyway rockstarr27 Uneven bezel size make it unattractive. The S8 will be here soon so oh well. Marty I was hyped for the S8 till I learned it won't have an in-display fingerprint scanner. Gonna add an iPhone to my collection as soon as the 8 is released. John Smith You're always shilling Marty. You were never going to praise the S8, so stop claiming you were 'hyped' for it, that's just dishonest as hell. You're a well known Samsung hater. Nice dream about the iPhone 8, which will be a copy of the S8, but still fall short. Marty Yeah, sure. Whatever you say... 😉 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/228e7dd67124eb4a74a54d58fc44e8c497b6e30c6ebfff014d367f7587286344.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d9678ba9ab4c38bf39e023533d865354656215fbcd767ff65e1c247df88ec7b.jpg Joshua Hill Have you nothing better to do than attack people in online comments? You seem like a disgraceful sort of human being, this is not how we treat one another. MattPortland Are you new? People treat each other like shit all over the internet. Joshua Hill No I'm not new. I generally don't bother commenting because I'm well aware of what the comments sections on the internet are like lol I guess I must be feeling unusually sociable today ;) SHunter Reading the good and the bad above, how the hell can you say this is a breath of fresh air? Are you high? stefan djordjevic No led notification light for 700$ .. lol surethom Really that's a deal breaker for me. Eclectech What's the point in having an LED notification light if the phone has an always on display that shows your notifications? stefan djordjevic Because I don't won't aod ? Can I have a choice on a 700$ phone. Lol Eclectech Choice?? You must be from a different Earth. Our Earth has makers like Apple who decide you don't need a headphone jack. Other features introduced then removed thru the years include IR blasters, kickstands and stereo speakers. Jedediah Hiscock Just preordered one from my carrier today. $297.00 promo card for the preorder so I'll only end up paying $300, can't complain to much for the price, and will be a nice upgrade from the G3. surethom No led notifications REALLY? that's the killer there. Second is always the camera & what are u doing LG please improve with a software update. Looks like it will be Samsung again. MattPortland Why do you need with an always on display? Margaritas Ante Porcos LG should have bundled this crap with tons of other crap and price it $2000. Why not? They are slipping Home crap and tv crap with G6 for 700+ bucks. This is insane. Also LG simply can't get it. People don't need mediocre phones for premium price. LG will be shedding crocs tears in few months. Joshua Hill In Australia they're bundling a free 40" full HD tv for absolutely nothing more ;) We do however get the Australia tax. For paying more what do Australians get??? No quad DAC no wireless charging. Stick your free tv where the sun don't shine LG and just give Aussies a decent version of the phone if we have to pay more for it! joseph carmine nero why not call it expensive?if this was a sony phone with SD821 AP would be screaming expensive Marty Yeah, 700+ for some reason makes Sony a bad guy. Joshua Hill I have owned 3 Sony's, currently my phone and tablet are both Sony's. My problem with Sony is they are expensive and don't tick all the basic boxes David was talking about in this review. In that sense they are over priced where as the G6 isn't. Having said that AP is probably the most biased tech site I regularly visit. It seems to be a choice they've made as they've been like this as long as I can remember and show no signs of changing to a more neutral/balanced reporting style. smonkeyball Since you have the Verizon model, would you tell us how it is in terms of bloatware or disabled features? G4 Verizon owner here, was pretty disappointed by the number of cool things it was supposed to do but cannot do. Unlike on other carriers. Arysyn I decided that I had no interest in the LG G6 from the first moment I heard of some of its specs, such as the SD821 (no 835, which I think if LG had to release this early, they could have gone with a high-end product from a Qualcomm competitor), no Quad Dac here in the U.S., a mixture of older Gorilla Glass implementations (not fully Gorilla Glass 5), etc. In fact, the only reason I read this review, was to see what David had to say bad about this device. Not that I'm trying to be negative about LG. After all, I own an LG OLED television that I like. However, I think this product just seems rushed to me. As if LG was in a hurry to update the G line, just because they wanted something to replace their failed G5. I believe this is a mistake that is going to show them once the Samsung Galaxy S8 devices get launched, so long as they don't blow up within weeks of launch. Although, it is very unlikely Samsung will not have corrected the Note 7 issues in the S8, which other than the lack of stylus, looks to be Note-like in terms of display size finally. Tomorrow certainly will be a big day. wade_county FYI: Gorilla Glass has hit a wall. GG5 is less prone to shatter but more prone to scratches (hence most of the back of the G6) GG4 is less prone for scratches (its on the G6 camera lens) duke69111 "I like to check my notifications without unlocking the screen. You could make the fingerprint reader key a custom button. Just a suggestion." Did they do away with double tap on screen to wake? David Ruddock No, it's still there. I just don't find it very reliable / I don't like "hitting" my phone when it's lying on a flat surface. duke69111 Ok, good deal. That's probably one of my favorite features on LG's phones. I wish more phone makers would incorporate this feature. Marty Sony does. D13H4RD2L1V3 Android 7.0? Didn't LG say it was gonna launch with 7.1? David Ruddock They got back to me: it's launching with 7.0. Bewear "Fresh air". Marty Of this phone and the OnePlus 3T, which one would people be more interested in buying? Marty Nobody has an opinion? Joshua Hill Neither, both too big imo ;) Marty If the size didn't matter? Joshua Hill If I was in to big phones the LG if the quad DAC model was available. This different models for different regions is bs and damaging to LG's brand! The model in my region has no wireless charging and no quad dac, so in practical terms the 3T. But the 3t is not officially available in my region and just as expensive as a S7 edge. So in real practical terms, still neither I would get the S7 edge or the sony xz premium if it was a decent price. Marty Yeah, the Premium would be good to have. It's too big, but it'd be a sweet phone. I'm also into smaller phones. Would much rather have a 5" device. Bought an Xperia XP and saw it's as big as devices with larger displays thanks to the chins. My ideal would be an Xperia X Compact with the specs of the Premium. Joshua Hill Unfortunately looks like Sony's compacts have just become mini's. They should really change the name as when Sony introduced 'compact' it was synonymous with flagship specs in a smaller device. Joshua Hill My ideal would be an S8 with a 0.2 - 0.3" smaller screen. For some reason I've set an arbitrary limit of 14cm maximum height for a phone. It's not truly arbitrary, it has to do with fitting in front pants pockets comfortably. Or if Sony would ever release a Z3 compact size device with a bezel-less screen. Marty I wear cargo pants...plenty of pockets...and I keep my large phone in one of those leg pockets. My Xperia I keep in a belt case. Marty I've changed my mind about Sony phones. No more for me. It's unacceptable that we here in the US can't have the convenience of a functioning fingerprint scanner. Matthew Bowe Why aren't we complaining about the missing IR port? Good_Ole_Pinocchio Because it's 2017 Andy J I really want it, but I'm sitting here with a less than 2 year old LGG4, having been through the news that it was not going to get Nougat - through to the news it will later in the year, but probably won't be terribly stable...... It makes it extremely difficult to justify spending £700 on a G6 that in 12 months will be a second class citizen as far as LG is concerned - and might not even get an upgrade to Android O...... paxmos Not a peexol fan but all you haters would kiss googel's ass if you had one in your hands. Since when LG has become a "breath of fresh air" with their phones?...LG = Liteary Garbage MeCampbell30 "I can definitely tell I'm not using a Samsung phone, I'll say that much." Can we get some Aloe vera for that burn? Cakefish No point, Samsung phones are always burning. Boom boom! I'll show myself out... Sayantan Chaudhuri I appreciate the risks that had to be taken for this _deep dive_ into the G6. Diego Kaku a good $400 phone, old chip, old glass, not first bezeless, wierd 18:9, smal battery. BrianB Someone's a pixel fanboy MattPortland Oh hell. 🙄 Shailesh Kumar All I know is that whoever clicked those phone pictures for this review has done an awesome job. Appreciate it. DJ SPY LG did something right. Since 2010, I've only owned Motorola and Google devices. Oh and I decided to try out the iPhone when Verizon had their $20 a month sale on it. Anyway, I pre ordered the G6 last week. I'm excited to see what this experience brings. It's been an interesting one wth the iPhone so far. I plan on using the G6 "as is" for a week or two to really get the feel of what LG is doing with their phones. Eddy Witkamp How can the battery life be both exceptionally good, but also bad? It's in both columns Eddy Witkamp @rdr0b11:disqus can you explain? Cakefish The only issue I have with reviews of the G6 is that reviewers only talk about the speed of the Snapdragon 821, as if it's the only thing that matters. They seem to forget that 821 is 14nm and 835 is 10nm. The latter will have superior power efficiency and thus, superior battery life in devices with equivalent battery capacities. Chazz Matthews OnePlus 3T doesn't have 1440p nor Qi wirleless charging. Until it does, there's no comparison. I won't buy a phone without either of those two features. aatifsumar Where's my removable battery grumbling thread? 3223 One thing i wish i knew from the review, in fact all reviews of this phone - does it have adoptable storage tho? Lg disabled it for their g5 afaik... KVragec In Croatia this will probably be cheaper than S8 so I'll probably go with G6. But S8 is crazy tempting. My G4 is now 2 years old and I'll change it for one of those Da Fuq I really want to like this phone, but the front of the S8 just looks so much better, curved or not. Random! Although I loved my Nexus 4 and my current LG G3, I don't have $ufficient to get the G6. What's the next best option? In the viable price range, I've been considering the G5 for its dual camera, the 3T for its processor and fingerprint reader, and also the Axon 7 and Honor 8 for being decent. Nexus 6p could also be considered. Opinions?

Moto G5 Plus review: Still the king of budget phones Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/27 12:45pm PDTMar 27, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares104 Moto G5 Plus Motorola Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design and display 5 Camera 6 Performance and battery 7 Software 8 Conclusion Motorola has gone through some big changes in the last few years; from its waning days of independence (with crummy phones), to the Google acquisition (with much better phones), and finally to being manhandled by Lenovo (with weird phones). One of Motorola's most important products through all of this has been the Moto G. The original Moto G boosted interest in budget devices by showing everyone they don't have to be terrible. Now, here we are with the fifth iteration—the Moto G5 Plus, a phone that can be yours for the low, low price of $230. The Moto G5 Plus looks and feels more premium than past devices in the series, but it also comes with a few limitations that keep it slotted in firmly below the Moto Z family. For the first time, there's a lot of metal in the chassis of a Moto G phone. However, the design definitely has some divisive elements. At the end of the day, I don't think you can spend a better $230 on a smartphone. Specs SoC Snapdragon 625 RAM 2GB/4GB Storage 32GB/64GB Display 5.2-inch 1080p LCD Battery 3,000 mAh Camera 12MP, 5MP Software Android 7.0 Measurements 150 x 74 x 7.7-9.7mm Price $229.99 - 2GB/32GB, $299.99 - 4GB/64GB The Good Design The addition of metal to the Moto G's chassis makes it more sturdy and gives it a premium feel. Fingerprint sensor It's fast and accurate. Better than other budget devices. Display The move to a more compact 5.2-inch LCD makes for a comfortable phone, and the display quality is great. Battery life Above average. It easily makes it through the day. Performance The G5 Plus is incredibly smooth for general smartphone tasks. Unlocked The G5 Plus works on virtually any network, GSM or CDMA. The Not So Good Design again The giant camera module looks a bit dopey. Camera It's lacking in low-light. MicroUSB Isn't it time to stop using this connector? NFC It doesn't have NFC, which is just kind of weird at this point. Gaming The Snapdragon 625 is not going to be good for intense games. Design and display As soon as you pick up the Moto G5 Plus, you can tell something has fundamentally changed. It has a much more solid feel in the hand than past Moto G phones—not that the Moto G4 felt like it was going to crumble to dust, but the body was entirely plastic with a removable rear cover. The Moto G5 has an aluminum back panel that doesn't come off. The edges are still plastic, but the metal gives it a reassuring heft. The Moto G5 is also slightly narrower and thinner than the G4, making it more comfortable to hold. Motorola seems to have tightened up the design all around. The back of the phone doesn't look great in pictures, mostly because of the large circular camera module. It's like the Moto Z phones, but on those devices it serves to stabilize the Moto Mods. Here, it's just a superficial design choice. I will say it looks nicer in person than it does in photos. It's annoying that the camera module sticks out from the back of the phone, though. Also on the back is a raised Motorola logo where there should be a dimple. I don't know why Moto refuses to do what we all want it to do. Bring the dimple back! On the top edge is a SIM and microSD card slot, which is relocated from behind the removable back cover on the G4. On the right are the power button and volume rocker. Both seem tactile and reasonably solid. On the bottom is the headphone jack and... a microUSB port. Motorola says this phone still has the microUSB because it wants people to be able to use all the cables they have laying around. Okay, but I think it's time to rip the band-aid off. This phone really should have a Type-C port. There's a fingerprint sensor on the front panel beneath the screen. It's larger and more prominent than the sensor on last year's phone. Performance is excellent. It would be great even for a much more expensive phone. Just a quick tap and the phone unlocks. You can also press and hold the sensor while the phone is awake to put it to sleep. The Moto G5 Plus has a 5.2-inch 1080p LCD, slightly smaller than last year's phone. This is still an IPS LCD, not the AMOLED displays you get on Motorola's more expensive phones. It's still a very good display with accurate colors and superb viewing angles. 1080p is the right resolution for this size. Higher and you'd be wasting battery; less and there would be visible pixelation. Even the black levels are good for an LCD. The default colors can be a bit muted if you're used to an AMOLED screen, even with the "vibrant" display mode active. Camera Budget phones are getting very good at a lot of things, but the cameras still hold them back. You've got to spend a little more to get something that's reliable, but that's not to say the Moto G5 Plus' camera is bad. It's just... unsurprising. This is a 12MP sensor with an f/1.7 aperture. However, it drops the laser autofocus from last year's Plus variant. In bright outdoor light, photos are crisp and (usually) accurately exposed. The photos look softer and more washed out compared to what you get from pricier phones, and it sometimes picks up too much glare. The camera still does well enough with medium indoor light. The white balance is alright, but capture times tick upward. This becomes a problem when you realize the G5 Plus doesn't have optical image stabilization. You have to hold the phone quite still, and it's a good idea to take a few shots to make sure you get at least one that isn't blurry. Noise also creeps into the photos, but it's better than most other phones in this price range. Previous Next The pictures taken in low light are a bit all over the map. Some of them come out looking better than I expected (though they are all rather dim), but others are blurry and noisy. There's a manual mode that can compensate for some of the problems if you want to fiddle around with it, but you're never going to get amazing photos with this camera in poor light. Performance and battery The Moto G5 Plus comes in two versions that vary in the amount of storage and RAM. The version I have to test has 4GB of RAM. All my observations are based on that, so note the 2GB base model might be slightly less capable. All versions have the Snapdragon 625 SoC, which I've found to be more than adequate. Here are some benchmarks. The SD625 is a capable chip, and the Moto G5 Plus uses it to good effect. Moto's phones tend to be very well optimized for the hardware, and this one is no exception. There's really no lag to be found on this device. Apps open in a snap and the 4GB of RAM ensures they stay operational in the background well. This might be different on the 2GB version, though. Gaming won't be particularly good on this phone. Simple titles are fine, but the 3D capabilities of the 625 are lacking. We're looking at a 3,000mAh battery in the Moto G5 Plus. That's a fairly standard size for phones, even much more powerful ones. The modest hardware in the G5 ensures you'll have more breathing room than you'd get with a faster phone. As usual, I should point out that battery life varies dramatically from one person to the next. My usage might not be anything like yours. I used the Moto G5 Plus for browsing the web, Twitter, email, and a little light gaming. The phone made it through the day like that reliably, usually with about a third of a charge left. When it's really pushed, the G5 Plus ekes out around six hours of screen time in a day. That's above average. If you go easier on it, the phone will probably get around 4 hours of active usage over 24-36 hours. It's not in the same league as the Moto Z Play, but this phone's battery life is more than sufficient. When it does run dry, the G5 Plus supports Moto's "TurboPower" via the microUSB port. This is still just a version of Quick Charge, and the included plug maxes out at 12v. Have I mentioned I'm annoyed this phone still has microUSB? Yeah? Good, because I am. Software There hasn't been much to complain about in recent years when it comes to Motorola's software, but there hasn't been as much to praise lately either. Stock Android has usurped some of Motorola's custom features, and the post-Lenovo Moto doesn't seem as able to innovate on software. There's very little that's new in this generation of the Moto G, but it does ship with Android 7.0 Nougat. Thus, it includes split-screen apps, Assistant, and all the other standard goodies. The home screen is unusual, but I think it's something we're going to see more often. Motorola used to ship phones with the Google Now Launcher, which is going away. Instead, the Moto G5 Plus runs something that looks a lot like the Pixel Launcher. It's not, though. It's technically Launcher3 with Pixel theming. There's a pull-up app drawer and the porthole folders, but they use a dark theme. There's also the Google feed panel on the left. The only obvious departure from the Pixel Launcher is the full search bar at the top of the main home screen. The home screen is snappy and looks nice, but I do have some concern that it won't see any updates outside of device OTAs like GNL did. The G5 Plus has both Moto Display and Moto Action features. Moto Display is, of course, the on-screen notification alert that appears as new items come in and when you pick up the phone. It's been tweaked slightly this year with the addition of a large battery/clock widget at the top of the screen. Moto Display is still a great way to check your notification content. You get basic info when Moto Display pops up, and a single tap lets you view notification details. I also like that only part of the screen is "active," so you can pick up the phone without worrying about waking the device completely. Moto Actions includes the flashlight chop, camera twist, and the other, less popular gestures. There's a new feature here: One-button nav. Activate this and your on-screen navigation buttons go away. The home, back, and overview actions are handled by the fingerprint sensor only. Tap for home, swipe left for back, and swipe right for overview. This seems crazy at first, but I've found myself kind of liking it. The gesture recognition is reliable and fast. The above control scheme would make split-screen mode impossible to activate (no way to long-press the overview button), but there's a new way to enable it. When you have the multitasking UI up, there's a section at the top of the screen where you can drag a card to activate split-screen. This is shown all the time, not just when One-button mode is on. I don't love this as it shrinks the space available for cards, but I understand the necessity. There's not much to complain about with regard to the G5 Plus' software—my concerns, as you can tell, are mostly nitpicks. I just wish Motorola still had the drive to innovate that it had a few years ago. None of the added features this time around are as interesting as Moto Display or Moto Voice were back in the Moto X days. Maybe as Moto settles in at Lenovo, we'll see more adventurous software. Conclusion You make some sacrifices when you buy a budget phone, but the Moto G5 Plus requires the fewest. It has capable hardware that allows for smooth operation, a good display, an accurate fingerprint sensor, clean software, solid build quality, and above average battery life. The camera is fine, but this is still one of the things that betrays the Moto G5 Plus as a budget phone. It's also not the most attractive phone I've ever seen, but it sort of grows on you. The asking price of $230 for the G5 Plus is a little higher than last year's G4, but less than the G4 Plus. The standard G5 will be a somewhat limited release, so we may not see it at all in the US. The G5 Plus as designed for the US market is unlocked with support for both CDMA and GSM carriers. That's something Motorola doesn't even do for its high end phones anymore due to the Verizon partnership. The version of the G5 Plus I've tested is the higher end one. That's priced at $299.99. I'm hesitant to give that SKU a firm recommendation because it is a big price jump over the base model. There's a microSD slot, so the storage difference shouldn't be a deciding factor. It comes down to the RAM. Is the bump to 4GB of RAM worth the added $70? I suspect the base model will be fine with 2GB of RAM, but not as adept at multitasking. Neither version has NFC, which is dumb. There's no reason budget phones can't have this. Budget phones have to compete with more expensive devices now more than ever. Payment plans have made phones like the Pixel financially justifiable for more consumers, so a budget phone needs to shine. Moto is one of the few OEMs that has consistently hit the mark. For a bit over $200, you can have a very capable phone that works anywhere. I can't think of another phone in this price range you should get instead of the G5 Plus. It's available for pre-order now and goes on sale for real this Friday, March 31st. Tags moto g5 plus Motorola phone reviews Reviews subscribe ...

ILOxsv One major update (Android O). Like with all Moto G generations before MrDrWho13 My original G got 2 major updates. Lenovo really dropped the ball. ILOxsv Oh. G 2014 also got 2 major updates Rocket The Moto G4 has guaranteed N and O so I'm willing to bet the G5 will get O and P. ILOxsv Source?

Thanks Itchy_Robot This is my concern too. Now a days, up-to-date security patches are critical for a phone purchase. I just don't trust these budget phones to get those. cvm Motorola promised to updates for the g4, N and O.

I have the factory unlocked G4 and I received my update 3 days ago. So far no bugs to report and battery life is a bit improved. RyanWhitwam It's the secret Marshmallow release for AP only. Shh. Frisi The launcher, is it a specific apk? Frisi nvm, found it on XDA. Crashes on Pixel for some reason. jwildman16 Link? Carlos Rodríguez "Moto G phones—not that the Mogo G4 felt.." I think that mechanical keyboard is making typos for you xD. Joking aside, this is a great phone for the price. Great review. Cheers! PS: On my 6P I can hold and drag to the top an app in the overview mode to enable split screen. There's no need to long press overview either. Mrd1 No NFC... Does this mean Android Pay won't work at all? I use it for the reward cards only... Just the barcode. When I had a Moto G3 it wasn't available... But I don't know if google now allows it to be used without NFC for loyalty cards. Mart Didn't the Meizu Pro 6 Plus (what a name...) get roasted by AP for having an all in one home button? I kinda like the idea. But I guess Google doesn't. Wondering if this could be implemented on any device with a modern fingerprint sensor. Rocket Sounds like the kind of name Apple would use on the next iPhone. Pro and Plus all in one because being regarded as premium isn't enough. T4rd What games did you try to play on it that made it lag? I've tried a few pretty graphical games on my wife's Z Play with the same SoC and it played smoother than my 6P because it doesn't throttle immediately. DanSan really curious to see real world differences between the 2GB and 4GB models. so far every review i've seen they had the 4GB model. Jair Moreno It seems that Motorola is getting many variants around the globe. At least here in Colombia, they launched a G5 Plus with dual sim and NFC. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fdd30110cdafe73aa98ccf0d2127a8cf8323e994bb2ee82214d5ad28fd33ddbc.png harmsi In Europe we have the Wileyfox Swift 2X and the BQ Aquaris X5 Plus (next model was already announced) as good alternatives. Marty No NFC means no hesitations unlocking the BL and flashing custom ROMs. Jair Moreno NFC is present in some variants of this phone Marty Could be. But the US versions...2, 3, 4...haven't had NFC. Jair Moreno At least in US they have AndroidPay to use it. Marty Can't use AP without NFC. Mrd1 This is the answer I was looking for above. Thank you sir. Very sad... I never pay with NFC or even add a credit card. I only use it to present the barcode for loyalty cards. Easier to have on my phone than to carry a growing stack of cards in my wallet. But, google has to lump the two together. I had hoped they fixed this in their software. Bastards. Jair Moreno It seems that Motorola is getting many variants around the globe. At least here in Colombia, they launched a G5 Plus with dual sim support and NFC. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fdd30110cdafe73aa98ccf0d2127a8cf8323e994bb2ee82214d5ad28fd33ddbc.png Snowsky419 Why does the Moto G5 Plus run a 32-bit version of Android? The hardware seems 64-bit capable! Jair Moreno How do you differences it? Matt Williams I think it looks great, shame that the Plus is just 5.2". Still crossing my fingers that there will be a Moto X Pure, even with a similar body. Change this to a larger screen, rear fingerprint sensor, USB-C, dual front firing speakers, and I think the Moto X Pure 2017 would be a hit. Tale 85 Check GSMarena, they hang a little tidbit on the Moto X (2017). SD625, 5.5" screen. Kind of like a Moto Z Play with a conventional back. Matt Williams Thanks. I think it looks a lot like the Moto G5, just with HTC style lines. No dual front facing speakers, unfortunately. 5.5" is a good size though. And it has the dimple! Too bad they still haven't made the dimple the fingerprint sensor. Tale 85 I've always thought the "dimple" would be a great place for a fingerprint sensor. I'll have to see more. But I don't think this is my next Moto X. I don't think they'll ever make a Style/Pure Edition successor. caroline eadie The finger print sensor on front is really good also convenient Tale 85 I just read an article about how much more "user friendly" a front mounted sensor is. It makes it a lot easier to unlock without picking it up. Makes sense to me. caroline eadie If I was a gambler I'd lay bets you will love it fantastic phone Tale 85 The G5 Plus looks great, and I've got. A couple friends seriously considering it. For me, it's just not a replacement for my Pure Edition. The LG G6 is going to do that. That's not going to stop me from highly recommending the G5. Cakefish G5 Plus has NFC in UK. Another example of region exclusive hardware. Lenovo are copying LG. JPLoureiro NFC support also confirmed in Spain and Portugal. Daniel Moshee But G5 was announced before G6. Shakil Shaikh NFC but 3GB/32GB which is at odds with the review too. Suyash Bansal We have it here in India too. Although I haven't seen anyone use NFC here. Not even once. Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're Id1ots. G5 Plus has NFC in UK/EU... but they removed the COMPASS!!! THE COMPASS! REALLY LENOVO? saimin What is Motorola's security patch policy for this phone? Will it get Google's monthly security patches? I'm not buying any phone that doesn't get regular security patches. ericshmerick If that's your requirement only a Pixel will work. Possibly Samsung, assuming they can stay faithful to the monthly security updates. I'm betting they will fall behind at some point. Moto slow af with updates of any kind. Daniel Moshee Samsung? LOL. Way behind than Moto. Get your facts right. caroline eadie Not as bad as Samsung gigis83 Doubt it g4 on July security TadMSTR This is probably not the answer you want but the Moto phones have had good community support over at XDA. I have several models running on 7.1 when Moto dropped support at previous versions. The Moto X 2nd gen for instance last had support at 5.1.1 but it runs 7.1 perfectly. I even have a couple of Droid Bionics on 6.0.1 when support stopped at gingerbread or kitkat. Now being that the Moto G is a very popular line from Moto I assume it will get the typical 18-24 mo official update support, possibly more if they are feeling kind. D13H4RD2L1V3 It does, but released much, MUCH less frequently. Antonello Piemonte Moto G3 here, on Jan 2017 security patch (Marshmallow tough) caroline eadie No it won't but I have security programs installed no problems ericshmerick No wifi calling on T-Mo, right? Also, is the Amazon ad-supported version on a completely different update path vs. the non-ad one? Updates are already really slow with Lenovo... Rocket I hope not, I'm kinda convinced to get the ad supported version so I can get 4GB RAM but not if they are going to have a slower update path. 😟 (On a Middle School budget so I can't afford the 4GB RAM by itself) Uzi Mafioso Nope. A friend has a Moto G4 Amazon. Received Nougat a couple of days ago... Bewear Why did they have to put a logo on the front? Previous devices had a clean front side. This is bad, Lenovorola. Alejandro The huge bezels are a deal-breaker for me. They make it look like a phone from 2012. Gerald Mark Super lame for you to complain about a budget phone continuing to use Micro-USB. I have a phone with USB-C, 2 devices actually, and the switch is anything but cheap, especially for good cords, so there may be other budget USB-C devices out there already, but you're gonna have to keep dreamin' about all budget devices switching over anytime soon. You must not understand the concept of why people buy lower-end phones. Some people have to, to "save money." IAMTHEL33KER Lol my $199 blu vivo 5 has usb type c aRvInD But I'd say tech would evolve faster when it starts reaching budget people. If 2G was still expansive as once was, none could afford to call like present..! Its all upto company to invest some extra dimme to push technology.. gigis83 Bad customer care is only thing keeping me away. caroline eadie I have had great customer care in the u.k from Motorola not 1ce could I say anything bad about them 07070 This phone not launching in my country is the only thing that keeps me away. Michael2011 I'll wait and see how the Nokia 6 turns out. D13H4RD2L1V3 The front actually looks alright. Liking the more-conventional finger scanner shape. The back, though. What in the world happened there? (Design tastes are subjective, though). That one-button nav is intriguing, though. As for the camera, I don't think anyone expected it to be great. But it's not super-terrible either, as most budget phones tend to have poor ones. They should adjust the post-processing, though. wade_county Another alternative is the ZTE Blade V8 Pro. It has NFC, bigger battery (3140 mAh) Type C and more RAM (3GB) as a base model for $230. MrQ 6.0 though Daniel Moshee No thanks for a phone with bloatwares and no updates. wade_county What bloatware? Also, Lenovorola hasn't been that great with updates either. caroline eadie I got 7 it's in the u.k Daniel Moshee Clearly you don't know anything about Chinese phone manufacturers. All you see is specs, which do not translate to anything in real life usage. And no, Moto has been the second quickest when it comes to updates. Though still far behind Nexus or Pixel. wade_county What the hell are you talking about? It doesn't have bloatware. Go read the reviews on that phone. http://www.androidcentral.com/zte-blade-v8-pro https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a74fdba3a49de0688a58c454713f87c35e6b1754115a8bb206c9f450be7a3a49.png caroline eadie It doesn't have bloatware and the couple of Moto settings are really useful it's more stock Android than anything Daniel Moshee Um? I was referring to the ZTE phone. Michael W. I have read a couple reviews but the only thing I want to know is the home button mechanical or haptic/taptic? I worry about mechanical buttons wearing out. I prefer to touch the home button not press it. Himesh Jain Haptic Himesh Jain "but you're never going to get amazing photos with this camera in poor light." But you can with manual mode, its just Auto mode in low light is not upto the mark. Steve McQueen Unless the motorola camerea software has changed, even in manual mode you're quite limited. I think the longest shutter you can set is something ridiculously short like 1/5 of a second. Nowhere near long enough for proper low-iso night shots. Himesh Jain 1/3 for back, 1/2 for front Devanshu Yadav NFC is supported by the variant sold in INDIA via FLIPKART RXG9 Which device has a better camera? Moto G5 Plus or Moto Z Play? YaKillaCJ Hmm, tempting but we all know the real "King of Budget" belongs to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro. Billy Jack Caldwell I'm in the U.S. and I have been really interested in buying a Moto G5 Plus when it becomes available here, but I've been browsing the Moto G forum on Reddit and reading comments about this phone on SlickDeals on almost-daily basis lately, and there's quite a bit of criticism about this phone. Which sucks, because this has caused me to go from being excited about the release of the G5 Plus here in the U.S. and anxious to see if I could afford to pre-order one for its March 31st release date, to being skeptical about it and wondering if it's going to be a major upgrade over the Moto G4 that I've had for the past 8-9 months. Is anyone on here currently using a Moto G4 or Moto G4 Plus? If so, what are some of your thoughts on how much of an upgrade (if any) the Moto G5 Plus would be over the G4 or G4 Plus? If so, are you planning on upgrading to the G5 Plus? If so, will it be the 32GB/2GB RAM device or the 64GB/4GB RAM model? And are you interested in buying the Amazon Prime Exclusive with Ads & Offers for the discounted price? As for the camera on the G5 Plus (which is one of the most-important qualities for myself personally), with regards to the average user's real world experiences, do y'all think it will be as good/great as people had hoped/anticipated it was going to be? The reviewer on here states that it's good in situations with good lighting, but seemed to imply that it wasn't exactly great overall; which is actually what I was thinking it was going to be, after reading some of the comments about the expectations of the camera's performance after it came out that the G5 Plus is supposed to be using some supposedly-great sensor (that's used in the Galaxy S7, if I'm not mistaken). And to those of you with a Moto G4 or G4 Plus, do you think the camera on the G5 Plus will be noticeably better? Sorry for the lengthy post. I'm still struggling to decide whether or not I want to try to buy a Moto G5 Plus, so if some of y'all would like to reply and share some of your thoughts on this, some feedback would be very much appreciated! P.S. What do some of you think about the Moto G5 Plus vs. the Moto Z play? Which device would you rather have personally? And why? And if it matters, I have T-Mobile service and am in the U.S. caroline eadie If you use Moto g4 plus I would stick with it it's an excellent phone the camera is great in low light shots I was also looking forward to g5 plus then saw it's 5.2 g4 plus 5.5 camera is also reduced from 16mp definitely not worth it I love my g4 plus not had any problems with it I believe g5 plus is a downgrade not an upgrade but would love to try z play looks like a great phone the only reason that I considered g5 plus was 625 from 617 but not doing it I'll see if I can get z play reasonable in the u.k but if not g4 plus wins Somnambulator camera megapixels means literally nothing in relation to quality, but the drop from 5.5 to 5.2" for the display coupled with the G5 plus sharing almost identical physical dimensions (aka it's a G4 plus with larger bezels) is making we very hesitant. my g4 plus is awesome, but i could just get a pixel xl through work... not in the same class, sure, but the moto g4 plus is more of what i want in a phone than the pixel xl (front fingerprint sensor, average bezels). vesus the moto g5 plus... im not so sure. if i wanted huge bezels I might as well get that pixel. caroline eadie Considering the price of Moto g4 plus it's a fantastic phone I wouldn't buy the g5 plus as I don't consider it an upgrade in a couple of way's it's a downgrade I pre ordered my g4 plus use it for hours a lot of hours every day and still as good as the day I got it just so happens that was the same day it came out never had any problems with any Moto phones Blane Stroud I would say the last 3 negatives are reaching pretty far. MicroUSB, while being phased out, is still ideal for a budget phone. If you're looking to save money, why get a phone that necessitates new cords? I prefer USB-C, but it's also super obvious why cheaper phones still use it (not expensive phones? Who knows.). NFC, again, not super useful in a budget phone. It's just not a widely used feature by the budget crowd. Like every manufacturer has mentioned this when they take it out of a phone. And, like with the other 2, gaming just isn't a priority on a budget phone. I would say gaming isn't a priority on any phone, but especially budget phones. It's just not a consideration. It's more of a bonus still. You get a good phone and it happens to play games well. You don't get a phone because it can play games well. caroline eadie I agree but my 12 year old plat's a lot of games on phone no problems with stuttering or throttling caroline eadie Sorry wouldn't buy him another expensive phone he loses the mm last 1 was stolen Islam Lenovo P2 or Honor 6X or P10 Lite similar price. (Europe) Xiaomi redmi note 4, Xiaomi Mi5 (imported from (China, Hong Kong) gobuddy But there is no magnetometer / compass in the UK version of the Moto G5. So using Google maps while walking is very clunky. Enough to make me look for an alternative. caroline eadie I am in the u.k and have no problems with Google maps on g4 plus RXG9 Which device takes better pictures? Moto G5 Plus or Moto Z Play? Steve McQueen I'd like to see how the ZTE Blade V8 Pro compares to this. It's 230USD on Amazon right now. Mrd1 I looked into that one the other day... There appears to be a hint of Alcatel Idol 3 -esque screen breakage going on, I think. Didn't get to research much, but I am wary. It's definitely not gorilla glass, which is sad. wade_county ZTE's site says it's GG3 Craig Jones Is there a Compass Sensor ??? G4 Play and Plus no go Gadgetman Moto G5 Plus so far seems perfect for me, more concern with basic phone features, storage and ram. Any phone that does not randomly reset while talking (Honor 5x) or have a fingerprint reader that is very picky, plus touchscreen not very responsive (Zte Axon 7 Mini) is a winner to me. Compared to those phones, on the Moto G5 every thing generally works at 3 times the speed, this is like a top a line Samsung to me:) mitchellbrian fox I am interested in the new Moto G5 Plus. I wanted to get the amazon version (mainly because of price) but am concerned that the Amazon "skin" or overlay, on top of the Moto overlay, on top of Nougat 7.0 will cause problems. I don't think I really know enough about how the Amazon overlay interacts with the Moto one, and that with Nougat, but think that the Amazon version might be a bad idea for me (besides the ads).

The search engine will give users a live analysis on how busy the business is and what users are up against if he goes there. The latest enhancement, according to a cnet.com report, will determine how crowded an area is within an hour’s time based on aggregated, anonymized location history data. “It can also help users manage their time by providing live crowd numbers for specific businesses,” the report said noting that one could check the stores around it to see where he can go to kill time until the crowd dies down.

Over a year later, Facebook's M assistant finally makes its way into Messenger Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:03pm PDTApr 6, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 119 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares178 Applications News Earlier today Facebook launched their new M assistant service in Messenger on iOS and Android for the US (with other countries to come). Much like Google Assistant in Allo it's meant to drop in at convenient points in a conversation to give you shortcuts and tools to simplify things. Facebook announced M well over a year ago, jumping a bit late on the bandwagon of personal assistants, but allegedly theirs is at least partially driven or overseen by real living human beings, which sets it apart from the others in no small way. If they manage to leverage enough other modern tech buzzwords like AI, machine learning, and perhaps some synergy for flavor, it may even be of some use. In any event, we knew it was being added to Messenger, and it's finally here. M brings us quick shortcuts like sending money, stickers, planning events, sharing location, or hailing a rideshare. Just like Google Assistant, it's able to make suggestions based on the content of messages you send and receive. For the privacy-conscious having that information sent anywhere other than the intended recipient might be reason for pause, but if you're using Facebook's Messenger then those messages are already passing through so many places outside of your control it's probably not a significant concern. I know what at least some of you are thinking. You see Facebook and Messenger and yawn, but M in Messenger actually fills a pretty tremendous niche and solves probably the largest problem that accompanies UI/UX design: discovery. Where and how do you find what you want (or even know what you want) within an interface?  We're long past the days of depending on any real accuracy in pictograms, and skeuomorphism really only helps our grandparents these days. So, in this new elegant era of minimalism, how do you find what you need? The beautiful and terrifying predictive power of tools like M and Google Assistant might just be the answer.

Google is retiring several Play Games features Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 10:57am PDTApr 4, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 64 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares133 Applications Google News You probably don't use the Google Play Games app (I sure can't remember the last time I did), but many games on the Play Store use its API. Developers can use the Play Games API to save game data to the cloud, add achievements, and integrate analytics. Today on the Android Developers Blog, Google announced it would shut down several features in Play Games Services. These include Gifts, Requests, and Quests. All three features will be supported until March 31st, 2018, so developers have a while to find alternatives. Other features like achievements and multiplayer will not be affected.

T’ I was an intern on the Play Games team 2014; nobody used these features (requests didn't exist then though). The other stuff is kinda popular though. Carson Saldanha 3 features I've never heard of Suicide_Note Meh. Can't say that I'll miss these features. Heck, i can count on one hand the number of times I've even opened the Play Games app. Bewear I don't even have it installed on my device... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think the features actually relied on using the app at all, so they're not really related. They were mainly APIs and functions app developers could use. They had interfaces IN the app, but that wasn't how they were meant to be used overall. CUEBALL Never used these features, but I do use the Play Games app once in a while. David Prieto Since we're taking about Play Games - have you guys noticed how unbearably slow the app has become? Like, you scroll and you get one frame per second, tops? Just Yes. I would love to use play games, and still I do use it, but the app is below garbage... Even worse than typical Google stuff. Tom Erlandsen Yup, Google Play Games and Facebook are the only two apps that really don't perform well on my Pixel XL mattcoz Yes, unbelievably slow. Kaptain75329 Exactly this. In reading the article, I decided to open the GPG app to see if I could use it as a one stop shop to get to my games and then hide all the individual icons from within Nova Launcher. That idea died fast on my Pixel XL and Pixel C. I was going to make exactly this point in the comments here, but I'm relieved to see I'm not the only one experiencing poor performance. Maybe Google will eventually fix it since the issue does not appear to be isolated. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ someone755 Works just fine for me on a 2014 flagship. Vitor Gatti Extremely laggy on my OnePlus3 with LineageOS 14.1 :( keithzg Additional data point, and some speculation: On my Nexus 6P (now running 7.1.2, woo!) the scrolling is a bit janky, but not nearly as slow as you're apparently experiencing. One particular thing I note, and I feel like this might be a key, is that the images for each game have to load each time; scroll by flicking up and then flicking down again and I see whitespace where the images load into after about a half second, or a bit less (but still visibly absent for a moment) once I've been doing this for a while. Scrolling a bit slower, I don't notice the pop-in and the scrolling is mostly smooth, but there's slight hiccups in the scrolling at the exact same place every time, presumably when it stops the thread briefly to load the images. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Dakoziol YES. Yet, when I Google it, the only place I see it mentioned is a OnePlus forum. Scrolling is janky and loading is slow on my Nexus 6 (but the sidebar is buttery smooth for some reason). No other app on my phone has the issue. Leave reviews guys! And developer feedback. Zachary Dunn That sucks. Quests sounds pretty cool. It's too bad this didn't take off. When I first saw the article title, i thought play games was being retired. Knowing Google, it will probably happen soon. Crafted Crows I hope not because most games use the cloud/achievements features and it would mean that google would kill off all the gaming features... Zachary Dunn I bet google will move the cloud save api under drive and kill off Play Games. Kurtis Whittington Sadly, I only saw one game use Quests (Adventure Capitalist), and it was usually stuff that was fairly difficult (shortened timer activation of special events, IE: Unlock all achievments in X event in 2 days out of what would normally be a 5 day timer). The only reason they had the Gifts/Requests stuff was to stave off the rediculous stupidity that was FB gaming long ago with all the posts and notifications you would send to everybody to try and get shit to progress in your game. As long as they keep the Achievments (I kind of like them) and cloud saves, I'm happy. The other stuff like the game recorder, rankings, etc I could take or leave. Drakenoid They should implement a screen recorder app in stead of game recorder imo. Zachary Dunn The game recorder would be really cool if they promoted it. They have a gaming platform with Android TV and a game focused streaming service with YouTube Gaming. But YTGaming and game streaming aren't available on AndroidTV. Quests sound like more in depth Achievements, which would be cool if Google could convince developers to use them. But Google has never shown any interest in promoting games and gaming features so devs never used them. EcE Gifts? What is this? Facebook? fijisiv More importantly... when is GPG getting stickers?!? Carson Saldanha Wdym "stickers"? Grey Did any game use these features? Every day it seems Google is more and more becoming the company that creates features to fill a checklist but never does anything with them. I don't like that. keithzg Eh, this seems reasonable. They figured devs might want these features so implemented them, but they weren't used and so they're deprecating them (which a long grace period). Of all the things Google has done over the past while, this isn't one of the things I can find any real fault in. TheSpaceUnicorn I actually use the play games app every time I play a game, I don't want my games to take up space on my homescreen or app drawer, so I just open up the play games app and choose what game I want to play. These specific features though, I've never used them and definitely won't miss them. REkzkaRZ Take up space on your homescreen or appdrawer? If you have less than 50 games, you should be ok. Plus have you heard of FOLDERS? TheSpaceUnicorn I've currently got about 11 games installed and I do use folders. I have a game related folder which has play games, YouTube gaming, PS messages, a Pokedex app, and the destiny companion app and I'd rather not flood that folder with all those games as well when I could just as easily just access them through the play games app. Besides, the games I have don't have icons in the icon pack I use, so, for the sake of aesthetics, I'd rather not have a bunch of icons that don't match. It works great for me, so what seems to be the issue? SyCoREAPER As long as cloud save doesn't go anywhere I am still a happy camper ilovetesla what did Gifts, Requests, and Quests do really im hearing these features now Kehnin Dyer I don't know about gifts and requests but quests let devs make like special acheivements that were active for a set amount of time or that reset. the api was clunky and it was just easier to handle that kind of stuff on your own, especially because it wasn't portable so if you wanted like weekly quests for users you needed to implement it multiple times for every platform and it saved no time. mattcoz They were horribly implented features that were incredibly slow and buggy, guess they don't want to bother fixing them. REkzkaRZ It's not the features, it's the entire thing. I'm a gamer, and I don't want ANY of Google Play's functionality. Thus, someone at Google did a stupid. mattcoz Some people seem to care about achievements and gamer scores and such stuff, doesn't mean it's stupid if you don't. Zachary Dunn I'm a gamer and I wanted all of these features. It's too bad nobody used Quests and most games with Achievements don't have quality achievements. Googlers aren't stupid because you didn't want to use these features. REkzkaRZ Don't pretend Android is more open or better than IOS & then force users to have an intrusive gamespy. The stupid is not allowing we who don't need/want this crapware to disable/uninstall w/o most games croaking. I have disabled the undesired features of "turn camera on, record GPS position, record audio/video, etc" but regularly am notified that this is off and causing Google Play Services problems. I wish it caused THEM problems and not me! Rob I suppose the Play Games APIs are baked into Google Play Services and the app isn't really required. This should be one of the Google Play apps you can uninstall (today you can uninstall Play Books and Play Newsstand, but not the other ones). BTW, I see my phone (Nexus 5X) stopped its nightly backups to Google Drive on March 29th. Since then, no backups, even though I'm charging every night and it usually triggers a backup. Someone else experiencing this? Look in Google Drive --> Backups or in Dashboard (google for Google Dashboard) Drunk Squirrel Well, no more. As my comment above, the Play Games app has become a necessity for saving games for like 2 years or so now. And nope, my backups are fine on my 3T & S6 edge. Rob Just saw your comment, I agree with you; really bad move! If a rooted user deletes it, will it cause OS troubles? (Just curious, I'm not rooted). Drunk Squirrel If you remove the app completely, and have a game that needs to save its data via Google API, it will redirect you to play store to download it. So, no, it is still ok to remove it if you don't game on your device. I don't game on my phone and therefore this is one of the first apps I always remove. keithzg Maybe you've literally just generated no data to be backed up that way? My 6P is showing today a bit before noon, my Pixel C though showing yesterday despite me using it today. Rob Well, at least I'm sure I've added a few new words to the keyboard dictionary since. Now it's been almost a week without backup, it usually​ uploads something every night, sometimes in the day like you're describing. It has never been like this before. Hope Google is doing some testing for new backup capabilities and it will be back for me soon :-) Hmm.... keithzg To be fair, isn't the keyboard portion synced across devices and tied to your account itself? In which case it wouldn't be part of the device-specific backups, I wouldn't think. I could be wrong, though! Drunk Squirrel Couple of years back, Play Games all wasn't even necessary to have in order to save game data, etc. They all used the API present within the Google Play services app. Why on earth has Google even separated the API from the G Play services and made it a must to have Play Games? What the actual fuck, Google?! Adam Margeson I think they're referring to the product, not app. The features they're referring to are the base code in Play Services. The Play Games app was more just a way to set up screen record sessions, look at your progress, connect with other players and the like. Drunk Squirrel Dude I know, I am just trying to get my voice across as the necessity to have this app for saving games data does not make any sense for me. Sir_Brizz They didn't? All of the Play Games stuff works regardless of whether or not the user has the app installed. The app is just supposed to give you a summary view of your account across games. Drunk Squirrel Nope, the app is now required in order to save game and achievements. Sir_Brizz I haven't worked on this in roughly a year but back then it was all in GPS. I just looked for the APIs again and they are split off to their own separate page now. WTFH? We can hope removing these features will be a step towards reintegrating the APIs or at least moving them to a background service instead of the stupid app itself. Drunk Squirrel I know, right?! If a game requests access to my G ☁️ for game data, let it do its thing ffs, why force us to have an extra​ app installed? REkzkaRZ I'm a gamer, and I don't want ANY of Google Play's functionality. It's not the features, it's the entire thing. Thus, someone at Google did a stupid. As a gamer, there's stuff I do want -- to read up on my current game(s), gather hints/tips, occasionally peer at spoilers, read what the community is doing in certain strategic games & learn about metastrategies, and ... uh ... play the darn game! Google Play just seems like spy-ware that keeps trying to act like it's giving me something I want, but I don't want it: achievements, an avatar, tracking how much I play different games, putting me in rankings, etc. *UNNECESSARY!* Tomasz Kucza As a developer I am with you. slurivariv > achievements, an avatar, tracking how much I play different games, putting me in rankings, etc. Isn't this what every gaming platform does though? Fruity101079 "Developers can use the Play Games API to save game data to the cloud". Yes but if you uninstall the game (or install it on another device) everything you made is not reused! It's here, you can see it on playgames, your "success" or unlocked functions are uploaded when you are playing but never downloaded later. Everything has to be redone. This is so stupid and useless...

Fact Check goes global for Search and Google News results Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 8:33am PDTApr 7, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares144 Google News The internet is a vast, wonderful, and sometimes dangerous place that allows for most people to find troves of information. Unfortunately, as we all know, not all of that is factually true. Back in October, Google introduced a method for publishers in certain countries to display a "Fact Check" tag next to their content in Search and News results. This signifies that the article had been verified as true by news and fact-checking organizations. The big announcement today is that this is rolling out globally in all languages. The information will appear clearly in a relevant search result, as you can see in the image above. It is important to keep in mind that not everything you query will be applicable and that there may be conflicting statements of "true" or "false" if multiple entities have fact-checked the information and arrived at differing conclusions. Google makes it very clear that it has nothing to do with this process; it is simply contributing to giving users the ability to make informed decisions for themselves. Publishers need to use the Schema.org ClaimReview markup on the pages where they fact check public statements. Only those that have been "algorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information" will be permitted to participate and Google reserves the right to ignore the markup if it determines that a publisher has not met the standards or guidelines. 115 organizations have participated in and contributed to this program.

M. Luciano They're not taking any action against them, just applying an informative label .. which is sorta what they do - provide information. Jordan Palmer Again, not sure what this has to do with censorship. Google is simply providing a tag that labels if an article has been fact-checked and by whom. You make the decision for yourself if you're willing to read/believe it. Nick I think people see it as Google delegating fact-checking to certain parties and people do not trust these certain parties or fear they will not be trustworthy sometime in the future. I don't have these problems, but it does highlight some deeper issues, some of which this does not solve. M. Luciano Right, but even if the labels are wrong, they're still labels. Are they changing the search rankings or choosing not to display content based on the labels? 7-down "Are they changing the search rankings or choosing not to display content based on the labels?" Not right now, no. But I have a feeling that it will happen in the near future once Google's algorithm orders what it thinks "fake news" should be listed and what shouldn't. Nick I trust Google to provide correct and relevant information all the time, most of us do. However, since this is a politically related feature people are afraid that suddenly an algorithm is going to give them incorrect information. While I do find that notion silly, I think it would be better for these folks if such an algorithm would be open source so people can verify that Google didn't code in some intentional bias into it. Klark Kenneth It was my understanding that at it's most basic level, Google isn't providing the information, at least not the foundation of the information itself but rather an index, or aggregate if you will, of all the information that's already out there. So I wouldn't blame Google or hold them responsible if I read an article on a certain news site that I found from a Google search and that said article wasn't factual. Nick That was my basic understanding too, but you can provide favorability when you are indexing. Again, I do find the notion silly, but speaking strictly for American thought on anything political, we don't fully trust anyone. Klark Kenneth I wholeheartedly agree! DKBNYC Google does not provide information. It only gives you access to information. Klark Kenneth "Google does not provide information. It's only one a several search engines that points you to relevant information you're looking for." FIFY abc Yes, Google should just open-source the algorithm that helped build the entire company. Nick Haha, I was highlighting how absurd it was for people to suddenly become afraid of an algorithm, sorry if that wasn't obvious enough. M. Luciano Even if they do start ranking results based on this information, wouldn't that be a good thing? Pushing the most relevant and accurate information to top and reducing the prevalence of false data? Klark Kenneth I see it as good thing but the question has to be asked of the news and fact checking organizations in reference to their credibility and integrity as it relates to their fact checking. Who do we trust? I mean I can further fact check the fact checking that's already been done so that I end up trusting my own research, which I do half the time anyway. 7-down "Even if they do start ranking results based on this information, wouldn't that be a good thing?" But how would Google know which is true and which isn't? Google got in trouble in past for promoting spammy/pirate sites. These machines aren't as smart as we think they are, problems will happen. M. Luciano I assume it'd be based on an analysis of the 115 or however many there are at the time trustworthy fact checking organizations, but obviously I can't know how that hypothetical would work. I'm not suggesting they should do it, just that if they were to decided to do so and could do so accurately, it wouldn't actually harm anyone. https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/ Nick Uh, well, if we're going off feelings here, I feel that Google would not ruin their reputation, in fact that'd be a very poor business decision. I'd actually to go as far to argue that something like this is perfect for an algorithm to do because evaluating sources can be open to a person's bias and cross checking the information is tedious and time consuming. TheSpaceUnicorn If the labels can be wrong, then there's literally no point in even having them. abc It gets even worse. You know how Google gives you search results right? But what about all the results they don't show you!!! George Byers The beginning of censorship on the Internet. M. Luciano Labeling whether or not something is accurate is censoring it? Sir_Brizz This isn't just "labeling". The sites that are used to "fact check" all have an unhealthy record of fact checking. It's not very hard to find a supposed "fact check" where the content of the check doesn't match with the score that was given. There is no scenario in which this ends well. M. Luciano It literally is just labeling, even if you disagree with the labels or even if the labels are incorrect. No content is being removed or even ranked differently from what we can tell - so all the content is still there, unchanged, with an extra information box available for those who care to know how accurate the information is. Pretty simple. And of the organizations here: https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/ are producing incorrect information? Source? Sir_Brizz The problem is that the labels aren't always correct. But the implication of including them in the search results is that they are correct and inform the people searching what is correct and incorrect information. That's not a good thing. Also, Snopes and PolitiFact and FactCheck have all been caught giving wrong scores, scoring based on partisanship, and giving opinion based scores multiple times. The roll up scores are utterly meaningless. They also cherry pick the things they even decide to fact check so they can use aggregated data to show trends that don't even exist. There is no such thing as a good fact checker. M. Luciano Even if 100% of the labels were incorrect, they don't actually impact the visibility or veracity of the content they are labeling. So even if you believe the effort is misguided, it's pretty much impossible to accurately call it censorship. I haven't heard of any of the fact checking places intentionally providing incorrect information, so if you have sources for them being dishonest I'd love to read about that. Sir_Brizz I never said censorship, but it is far from simply labeling the information because the label carries an implication of accuracy. M. Luciano Roger that; we're in a comment chain that begins with me questioning how this is censorship. My fault for the confusion. Sir_Brizz You also said it was labeling, which is what my comment stemmed from. Sorry for the confusion. pfmiller I've seen that accusation made about Snopes, but it always turns out the person saying they're wrong misread the article. So do you have any specific examples you can provide? Sir_Brizz I didn't call out Snopes specifically, although I know they have some incorrectly reasoned conclusions while being generally accurate. PolitiFact, however, has a pretty horrible track record, doesn't follow their own procedures and standards, and has several fact checks that say they are not true at all while reading the content of the fact check shows that the statements were mostly true but injecting PolitiFact's own biases into them makes them false. Who are the whistleblowers on the fact check industry? Here's one blog that at least tries to keep them honest. Not that it has been effective over the years they have been doing this. http://www.politifactbias.com/ Still, the more important thing about the fact that a blog like this can exist is that facts are rarely black and white, and that you can slant almost any factual information in any way you want. And rollup truth meters are meaningless and undermine fact checking. A Person Who decides what is accurate and how did they reach their conclusion? M. Luciano For now it seems to be associated with these folks: https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/ But as indicated below, whether or not something is labeled correctly does not impact whether or not it is censorship. The information is not being hidden or removed, it simply has additional information available for those seeking more knowledge about the content. A Person That was a rhetorical question. M. Luciano Weird, because it has a very straightforward and easily ascertained answer as a sincere question as well. abc Read the article. It's been answered. TheSpaceUnicorn He didn't say it was, it said it's the beginning. Only a fool wouldn't see the dangerous slippery slope this creates and the implications this has on the future if it's approached with ill intent. M. Luciano What's the intent behind this? https://blog.google/products/search/fact-check-now-available-google-search-and-news-around-world/ TheSpaceUnicorn It's like you didn't even read my comment. M. Luciano Implications of this is done with I'll intent. Is this being done with bad intentions? Seems pretty important to discern that. TheSpaceUnicorn Please, quote where I said this is being done with bad intentions, because that's not what I said. M. Luciano You indicated that it would be bad if this were to be done with bad intentions. I am asking for your assessment of whether or not this current action is being done with positive or negative intentions. Is what Google is doing right now a step that they are making out of malice or is it something they're doing to try to help? TheSpaceUnicorn It's obviously something they're doing to try and help, that however doesn't alleviate them from the slippery slope this presents. Chris Lambert I don't see a slippery slope when the phrase "Hold on, this is bullshit!" is used. It probably should be used more often. TheSpaceUnicorn Really? You don't see how this could potentially turn into something where Google promotes a political agenda they agree with? Understand, I'm not saying this is a bad thing, I'm just saying we all need to be absolutly sure this will always remain third party and impartial. 4Ui812 That sounds like fearing mongering. verboze By this logic, one could argue censorship has been in place for decades. After all, search engines only surface results they deem relevant, and most people won't bother looking past the first few results. I don't see how offering additional information is implicative of censorship. The original information is presented alongside the results, and users are free to decide what to believe for themselves. I would bite your argument if they were removing the original assertion. abc Uhm, if search engines wanted to censor content, they could, you know, simply not display it in the search results. TheSpaceUnicorn Sure, and who's to say in the future they won't start factoring in what fact checkers say to influence what content doesn't get displayed in the search results? There just needs to be a guarantee that this will never become anything more than just a label and that the labels will always be true and purely objective. Amarus Kh What's being censored? The way I see it, it's basically the same as showing movie ratings when you look for a movie. You can still choose for yourself what you want to read and believe or not. Jordan Palmer This has absolutely nothing to do with censorship. Vivek Rameses This is the very definition of censorship. M. Luciano How so? They're applying a label to results, not changing results. They're informing people about what type of content they're presented with. What do you think censorship is? Ryan Cavitt It's trying to silence things by applying negative labels to them. Much like people are labeled as racists for disagreeing with Black Lies Matter. M. Luciano That's a very poor definition and it misses the point of this proposal. Presumably you think that applying a label that something is factually incorrect is a negative label which would mean that a label that says something is factually correct is a positive label. So if there are both positive and negative labels then you could also look at this as promoting the truth rather than disparaging the lies. The fact that you choose to look at this as an assault against something is very strange since all it is doing is giving consumers more information to be able to make Intelligent Decisions about how they choose to use their time. Ryan Cavitt These fact checkers always lie by omission, they always leave out a key part of the story that changes the situation entirely, that or the rating does not always line up with the associated article. So they are using the label "incorrect" as a way to shame and silence the smaller media outlets. If you rely on a "fact checker" instead of doing the homework yourself, then you are incapable of making intelligent decisions and you should be laughed off of any debate floor. M. Luciano Can you please provide evidence that every fact check always misrepresented the facts? As indicated elsewhere, the fact checkers typically provide their sources, meaning that you can easily read those sources for yourself. Ryan Cavitt Where did I say they always misrepresented that facts? That is a logical fallacy known as Strawman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LimZhkArmXU M. Luciano "These fact checkers always lie by omission, they always leave out a key part of the story that changes the situation entirely, that or the rating does not always line up with the associated article. " Did you mean something else? Sir_Brizz You said that he claimed "every fact check always misrepresented the facts". He did not say that or imply that. M. Luciano He literally said they always lie by omission or give a rating unjustified by the article. Sir_Brizz He said they always do one of two things: misrepresent the facts, or the rating doesn't line up with the facts. M. Luciano And producing a conclusion that doesn't accurately reflect the data is misrepresenting the facts, as is lying by omission. So either way, they are implying every single fact checking article by every single fact checker is intentionally misleading readers. So that type of far out claim should require substantiation. Otherwise we could say that sometimes they do or occasionally they do... But even that sort of an outrageous claim attacking their work should be backed up by evidence. Has it ever happened? Are you positive they did so maliciously? Was that proven? Did they post a retraction? Sir_Brizz I'm not going to argue what anyone "always" does. However, you should be a bit more specific about what you disagree with if you're going to split hairs. Also, I wouldn't call the rollup score "misrepresenting facts" explicitly because the rollup score is based on what the author thinks. It doesn't have to line up with the stated facts. That's why rollup scoring is stupid on fact checks, and why including rollup scores on Google is equally stupid. M. Luciano I could be led to accept that as possible, but that's pretty different from what the person that's accusing me of lying said. Sir_Brizz Fair. Ryan Cavitt Isn't it nice when you can twist words to suit your narrative? I am glad I am able to debate honestly. M. Luciano You said they always lie. Prove that. Right now you're pretending I'm lying, which is dishonest in itself. If I misunderstood you, then explain yourself clearly. Ryan Cavitt I am under no obligation to prove your strawman and Sir_Brizz already explained your mistake. M. Luciano It's not my straw man; I restated yours. We can be done though, you're clearly disingenuous. If you were sincere, you would have welcomed the opportunity to clarify your position. Anyway, have a good one. Ryan Cavitt I dont need to, you need to grasp the English language. " they always leave out a key part of the story that changes the situation entirely, THAT OR THE RATING DOES NOT ALWAYS LINE UP WITH THE ASSOCIATED ARTICLE." Until you take the entire argument instead of a cherry pick, you have lost. M. Luciano Sound good mate, cya later. Chris Lambert He literally just quoted you. Ryan Cavitt No, he really didn't. He just cherry picked out what he liked then left out the rest. He'd make a great writer for a "fact checker!" Maybe he could also give a rating that does not exactly line up with the article too! Klark Kenneth Yes, please give us the updated definition of censorship since it obviously no longer means suppression or prohibition of, in this particular case, news and information. We'll wait. verboze lol abc No, it's not. A Person I would argue that it censors credibility. M. Luciano Can you elaborate on what you mean by that? A Person You're researching any certain topic and before you even have a chance to read the article and form your own opinion, you're told whether you should find it credible. Just remember that "fake news" didn't exist prior to Hillary's 2016 election loss... so who do you think is at the wheel of this bullsh!t monolith? M. Luciano That's actually a great reason to do this. You're doing research and a) you don't have to waste your time on things that have been proven to be incorrect and b) you don't have to waste your time on things that have been proven to be correct UNLESS you want to link to the fact checker's analysis and use THEIR primary sources. Because you don't use CBS and NBC, Wikipedia and Snopes or whatever for research, you use actual credible sources - scholarly research that's held up to critique, primary sources, etc. So if you see this tag, it's only usefulness in a research setting is to click on the fact checker's analysis in order to get the fastest access possible to the actual facts you'd need to do a credible analysis of your own. Also, fact checking organizations have been around for a long time. They didn't start last year. Sir_Brizz "you don't have to waste your time on things that have been proven to be incorrect" That might work if this was that, but it's not. "A fact checker found this to be wrong" doesn't always line up with "this is actually wrong information". M. Luciano I am describing that it is a quicker way to get to the actual information. So rather than reading a bunch of irrelevant sources or their interpretation of events and rather than taking the fact Checkers word for it, you can instead just use their link to the original data itself and analyze that. Knowledgeborn Allah That sounds good in theory, but how many people do you actually expect to do that? I can assure you that most people won't... And then, citing this precedent, it's only a matter of time before other "news" organizations, like Fox News and Breitbart, start coming out with their own 'fact-checkers' to support their perspectives. Sir_Brizz The point is that they are baking an implication into the search results already. The fact that they show up next to the news sources themselves gives the fact checks higher relevance than they might otherwise have. That doesn't help anything. Sir_Brizz "Fake news" has existed for centuries. The past 30 years roughly are the first time in the history of the world that we even have the capability to understand what is true and what is false from the media or anywhere else. As long as a media has existed, it has been used to spread propaganda and drive public opinion. This time in history is not unique on that in any tangible way. That being said, you're right that the first time anyone cared about it was when Hillary's campaign started trotting it around as the exclusive reason for Trump doing so well. A Person I'm not going to pretend you're stupid simply because we disagree. I am obviously speaking of the new found and near-daily media coverage. You know that's what I mean. I know fake news has existed forever. I'm speaking specifically to the media attention it's garnered since the election: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=fake%20news Sir_Brizz I wasn't saying that to disagree with you but to point out that this whole "post-truth" hysteria has no basis in fact itself. Chris Lambert Bullshit has been around for a long time. abc Sure, it didn't exist because there are no countries on earth other than America. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lying_press O’Malley (Deplorable) Fact checking is a made up liberal construct Klark Kenneth What?!? The liberal comment aside, checking if something is factual or not is made up? Nick It's a joke about America's political climate. Then again I can never tell anymore. Klark Kenneth Well in that case, LMAO. After I posted the comment I wondered if I'd missed the point and I see that I did, or may have. pfmiller If someone calls themselves deplorable, believe them. O’Malley (Deplorable) Let's see... Google practically had their own office in the Whitehouse when Obama was president. Google is run by liberals so their fact checking is, by default, a joke. Klark Kenneth Can I fact check your practicality claim? Let me search Google... O’Malley (Deplorable) Please do. I believe Google accounted for the most visits to the Whitehouse Jordan Palmer Once more, Google is NOT doing the fact-checking. O’Malley (Deplorable) Hahaha ericshmerick But they are deciding which fact checking sites to include in their search results. So, they are fact checking. And lol @ snopes. Their agenda is really obvious. M. Luciano They are testing each site that chooses to apply to see if their publication meets standards. Those that are not qualified to do so are not included. That's not like cherry picking which fact checkers agree with you, it's a simple step to exclude those that are going to sabotage the project. MJ See folks... This man's brain has been so damaged by fake news and other Internet morons over the years all he can see is "liberal" conspiracies in everything. So sad it's to late for him... O’Malley (Deplorable) The real difference between you and I is that I can do my own fact checking. I can do critical thinking. You (liberals) need some monkey in an office to tell you what to read. YOU need censorship because you can't think for yourself. M. Luciano No one is censoring anything. Based on some of your comments, you're not even capable of comprehending the article here, let alone fact checking it. A thing is true or not regardless of any individual's political leanings. That's how facts work. Are you suggesting that you could see one article that's confirmed as accurate and another that's confirmed as false and somehow through your powers of critical thinking you'd believe that the false one was true and the true one was false? That doesn't make you smart, that makes you either gullible or delusional. Neither one of those are strong indicators of critical analysis. George if you're doing your own fact checking... then you're a liberal... M. Luciano Facts don't have political bias. They are true or not on their own. Sir_Brizz "Facts" can be slanted to support just about any worldview you'd like to support. pfmiller Sure, "facts" can be. Facts, on the other hand, can not be. Sir_Brizz Lots of facts are "facts" and the only reason you think they are facts is because the person fact checking them is someone you agree with. pfmiller No, the reason I think they are facts is because they have been documented as so. Legitimate fact checkers always provide their sources. Sir_Brizz So you don't consider Snopes or PolitiFact as legitimate then, since they have failed to provide their sources on numerous occasions? If a fact checker injects any bias into their fact checks (which happens a lot in all directions) it casts doubt on both their ability to fact check and the entire fact checking industry. Fact checkers are the ones destroying fact checking. pfmiller I don't recall ever seeing an unsourced article on Snopes. Again, do you have any specific examples? Sir_Brizz I didn't say "unsourced". I'm not sure there is an article on Snopes without a single source. Still, providing sources doesn't even make them legitimate. There is this story: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/12/22/the-daily-mail-snopes-story-and-fact-checking-the-fact-checkers/#152ec7ef227f There are numerous cases where a fact check was determined to be True or False based on hearsay (where an "unknown" or "unverified" would have been more accurate). There are also several cases where the claims that are fact checked don't really line up with the statement they claim to be fact checking. There is more to fact checking than providing sources. pfmiller I don't understand. There is nothing in that article or the article it is about that provides an example of a misleading article on Snopes. Sir_Brizz I never said that article had an example of a misleading fact check. That article, and lots of other things, cast doubt on the accuracy and neutrality of Snopes. There are similar problems with PolitiFact. These organizations drag down the credibility of the entire industry. Someone else posted a video that has multiple examples of misleading fact checks by Snopes. They are also not that hard to find. pfmiller If they aren't so hard to find I'm surprised you haven't found one yet after multiple requests. This article doesn't do anything to cast doubt on Snopes' credibility since their credibility is based on the quality of the articles themselves. Sir_Brizz http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-freed-child-rapist-laughed-about-it/ Let's see if you can figure out what is wrong with this fact check. Also, the credibility of the organization Snopes absolutely has something to do with the credibility of their fact checks. More than anything, that article points out the multitude of ways that Snopes is not transparent or open about their processes and why being that way casts doubt on their credibility. pfmiller I'm going to say it doesn't fit the narrative the right has created about Clinton. Am I right? Sir_Brizz LOL. I see that you don't have any interest in objectivity here. I don't think this story mattered at all. However, whether the story matters or not has nothing to do with this fact check. pfmiller So what do you think is wrong with the article? M. Luciano The fact is a bit of information that exists independently of the person perceiving it's perception of it. Whether or not someone is able to add information or context in order to mislead does not impact the actual fact itself. Sir_Brizz Please show me a political based fact check that does nothing other than deal with the very specific and narrow definition of whether the stated information is factual or not. Knowledgeborn Allah And this is exactly why I'm not a big fan of this change... Fact-checking is good in theory, but people manipulate facts all the time to justify their biases and preconceived worldviews. Recently, that's proven to be especially true when it comes to politics. There's no such thing as unbiased (or neutral) journalism. And, at the end of the day, people are going to believe whatever they want to believe anyway. George that was in response to O'Malley (Deplorable)....... you missed the /s Chris Lambert This. MJ The difference between me and you is I am NOT idiot. There is NO censorship going on so you don't even understand the basic facts of what this post is about. You presume I am liberal and I don't do my own fact checking. You literally have NOTHING to contribute to this discussion. Thanks for playing. M. Luciano Fact checking is only controversial if you have a worldview that is based on feelings rather than facts. A Person Don't remove a key part of the statement's context and then ask him to justify the new one that you've constructed. M. Luciano Ok, let's try this one: "In what way is 'fact checking a made up liberal construct'?" A Person "Fake news" wasn't a thing till the moment the Democrats were absolutely raped in the 2016 election cycle. Now, it's all you hear about. Same with Russia: "The '80s called, Mitt, they want their foreign policy back, lol"... "Mr. Trump should grow up. Our elections cannot be hacked"... and then they lost, and now? Surprise surprise! M. Luciano Weird verboze While we're here debating the veracity of fact-checking, those who benefit from the doubt cast are on to their businesses. Right or wrong, fact-checking OPTIONAL analysis to consider, and does not deter from actually reading the original content and forming one's own opinion. No one will be forcing you to accept fact checks. As for the liberal thing... Beats me where you pulled that one from. EDIT: saw your reply to Klark below. LOLZ. Nick Don't be so overly dramatic. DKBNYC Couple of things here. First, the internet is already censored. Always was. Second, " if multiple entities have fact-checked the information and arrived at differing conclusions." Then one of the conclusions is not a fact. Sir_Brizz Then who would decide which fact checker was the one with the correct facts? Klark Kenneth The 'who' certainly doesn't include Google; it's not Google's job here. They're merely providing the tag for what's already been done by others. Sir_Brizz I'm not really arguing that point, but this label doesn't really deal with conflicting "fact checks". Max Johnson That whole election ordeal made me switch to DuckDuckGo. M. Luciano What is "that whole election ordeal"? Vilmar When people typed a "Hillary Clinton/Trump is a" and got quick suggestion based on what people searched for most, some decided this was Google manipulating things. M. Luciano So relevant and personalized search results? DKBNYC No, lies and Russian propaganda. M. Luciano "and got quick suggestion based on what people searched for most" is what the commentor said. That's how all of Google's autofill works. It tries to predict what you're searching for based on both your search history and on the most common searches for people typing the same thing and with similar search histories to your own. That's relevant and personalized search results. What is it that you're talking about that they were not talking about? DKBNYC Sounds like it keeps people closed minded to me. M. Luciano How so? Vivek Rameses This is the most ridiculous bullshit ever. I'm surprised their fan base hasn't dropped significantly. M. Luciano What is ridiculous about it and what do you think their "fans", or users, wouldn't like about it? Nogib Except that the third party sites they are using for their *cough* "fact checking" are literally so neck deep in their own political biases that it isn't even funny. Objective is not a word one could use to describe this alleged fact checking. M. Luciano Guess that's why there are 115 organizations and a thorough screening process - to eliminate any perceived bias. But just curious, what exactly are you referring to? pfmiller People who don't like the truth always get butthurt over fact checking. Devin Rodriguez Politifact finds this argument to be mostly true. Ken Mitchell Politfact also assures us that Syria has no more chemical weapons, so I guess those dead babies are mythical. M. Luciano Link to that? Devin Rodriguez I think he didn't quite understand my sarcasm. Mine was the good kind, his was just mean. Sir_Brizz You mean this? http://www.politifactbias.com/2017/04/politifact-fixes-fact-check-on-syrian.html M. Luciano I may be missing something, but looks like they *may have* made a mistake and another blog doesn't like how they updated on the situation. Even the blog notes that the information may have been correct and just out of date, since it's an article that's 2-3 years old and new things could have transpired in that period. Something being probably true in 2014, when commenting on the current political state of events, can't be expected to be permanently true, right? Or is there another angle to this that we should be discussing? Sir_Brizz The blog is pointing out how PolitiFact doesn't treat mistakes properly. I don't think they were necessarily trying to say there was anything wrong with the initial conclusion they came to (although the lack of actual facts should have been a giveaway that they didn't know), but they didn't handle updating the fact check in a transparent or open way at all. takpro So, It's your assertion that all the chemical weapons were gone in 2014, but somehow returned in 2017 without notice? Accum's Razor: It's more likely they were always there. The people that assured the American public that they were gone, were wrong...at best. M. Luciano Oh no, that's not my assertion at all. I said that a long time had passed in a war zone and it's possible things changed. I don't see this example as an organization intentionally misleading their audience. But I have no idea whatsoever if they were correct or not in 2014. USCanthony You do realize that you are linking to a website that exists simply to hate Politifact. The person or persons that started and maintain this blog believe that Politifact is very biased which is why Politifact is always stating that the things they believe are untrue.That in itself is extreme bias on the part of the people who run that blog and therefore you cannot take anything you read there with a grain of salt. Sir_Brizz You realize you are dismissing a site that is critical of PolitiFact just because they clearly state they are critical of PolitiFact. Fact checkers need people to keep them honest. They are not above reproach. Also, that blog does not claim that everything PolitiFact says or does is wrong. In the post in question, please let me know how the reasoning of the author is wrong. USCanthony I am actually stating that you cannot provide proof of bias on Politifacts part when that proof is a link to a website that has a reputation for having an anti-politifact bias. I was not questioning whether politifact themselves had any bias. It is very difficult to be 100% unbiased at all times and I have no doubt that at times Politifact may have come across as being biased but as a whole, they do a pretty good job of being balanced. They stick to the provable facts (information that has supporting empirical data from multiple sources) but sometimes their delivery of those facts comes across wrong. They have also been incorrect every now and then but that had more to do with what was thought to be proven facts was actually a ruse or scam that even multiple news outlets were suckered in with. That happens sometimes and it is usually a very sophisticated and targeted attempt to change a narrative that succeeds in fooling professional news organizations. When that happens though, people need to keep in mind that the news organization was not trying to deceive the public or purposely mislead with a false narrative. They believed that the data they had gathered was correct. They vetted and verified that data with multiple sources and it passed all of their vetting without any red flags popping up. They thought they were presenting a factual story/arguement. Unfortunately they were victims to a very sophisticated operation to spin an alternate narrative and they did not realize this until much later. That doesn't make them dishonest though. They truly believed what they had reported. It sometimes looks like they are very biased though because the majority of their fact checking has not gone in favor of the GOP' Sir_Brizz "you cannot provide proof of bias on Politifacts part when that proof is a link to a website that has a reputation for having an anti-politifact bias" This is wrong. The proof of PolitiFact bias is present in the content of the post you refuse to even read or critique. If you think it is wrong, why? It's laughable that you think PolitiFact (or any other fact checker) stick to "provable facts". Many of the fact checks rely heavily on what people say as fact and ignore what is actually happening. That fact check was no different. As I said above, I don't even necessarily think it was that bad for them to have posted the original article (although they had no real evidence to come up with their rollup score, which is just more proof that the rollup scores are stupid), what's worse is how they corrected it when new information was presented. vwnut13 "If you want to fact check, just visit hillaryclinton.com!" - Hillary Clinton Sir_Brizz I know this was meant to be a joke, but the fact checking sites generally do use people's own words as evidence in whatever they are fact checking as if words = action.

For example , Bruce Jenner "identifies" as a woman and Rachel Dolezal "identifies" with being black. How will this algorithm account for that considering some people in the media defend this practice of insanity? M. Luciano A falsifiable claim is either true or it isn't. People's interpretation of it or even ability to discover whether or not it is definitely true or false does not impact the truth of the claim itself. So "Is Rachel Dolezal black" might have a definite yes or no answer and, if it does, whether or not you or I agree with that answer does not actually change the answer. 4Ui812 Tillerson pointedly said the United States did not discuss the military strike with Russian President Vladimir Putin or the Russian political leadership in Moscow either before or after it occurred. But the U.S. military said it communicated with the Russian military to minimize any chance of Russian casualties -- in particular Russians operating out of the targeted airfield. This paragraph here contains truth, spin and while technically not a lie a lie all the same. How would a fact checker rank this? Deductive reasoning is why I said it's a lie all the same. Bruce Wayne That makes no sense. Of course it doesn't change the answer but it's still false. M. Luciano I don't know who she is to know if it's yes or no, but it's definitely one or the other unless she's partial, then that's pretty much yes. Sir_Brizz You should read up on her then? She was in charge of the NAACP until it was learned that she had no black heritage whatsoever and was misrepresenting herself as black. This week, she stated that she identifies herself as "trans-black". M. Luciano I'm not a psychiatrist but I'm not sure that's a thing one can be. Sir_Brizz You don't have to tell me twice. Ken Mitchell "A falsifiable claim is either true or it isn't. " Politifact, one of Google's Anointed Ones, rates as "True" the John Kerry claim that Syria destroyed all of their chemical weapons. And yet, there are STILL dead babies on the ground. Vorastra The irony... something_new This will not work. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People debate the definition of censorship. Jason so google wants to "give users the ability to make informed decisions for themselves." by taking away the need to make an informed decision FOR YOURSELF!!! so we started with facts. but some facts werent facts so we needed to fact check. and now we have fact checked facts. of course fact checked facts may contradict each other. but thats because we want you to check the fact checking of the facts and then decide for yourself if it is in fact fact. got it? Vivek Rameses Just more reasons to not use this shitty company. Ken Mitchell Neither PolitiFact nor Snopes are reliable thought-police; both are pretty far left. Politifact, for example, rated John Kerry's assurances that Syria had NO chemical weapons as "Mostly true". Tell that to the dead babies. M. Luciano Just read what another poster linked about this. In 2014 they thought it was probably true. Are they expected to be psychic and predict what may happen 2-3 years later? Sir_Brizz If they are actually fact checking, then the lack of information should not lead to anything other than an "unknown" result. Imparus Wrong, every law in physics is based on only being "mostly true" until we find something that get closer to the truth, from your logic we should never have any laws to describe things that happens, since nothing can actually be proven with a 100% certainty Bruce Wayne Like I would ever trust a far left liberal company like Google to provide accurate fact checking. M. Luciano Luckily, they're not checking facts. They're providing links to others with qualifications to do so when they have done so. Also, Google isn't really liberal. Sir_Brizz Unluckily, the organizations they are trusting are not any less liberal than they are. For this system to be as neutral as it can be, they should find fact checks by multiple sources with differing conclusions and political leanings and present them all. However, this minor change alone really made Search UX an utter mess so adding even more info isn't a great idea. M. Luciano Neutrality, especially politically, is not a valid goal of journalism. Objectivity is. So what is true matters, not whose narrative is served by it. Sir_Brizz Is fact checking journalism? If it is, they are doing it wrong. If it's not, they are doing it wrong. In the case of fact checking, objectivity should equal neutrality. vwnut13 Politifact and Snopes... LMAO! Kurt Schultz "[...] a method for publishers in certain countries to display a "Fact Check" tag next to their content in Search and News results" So publishers get to mark their own content as fact checked? That makes absolutely no sense! StopBeingOffendedDERP Right...from a company that has ties to US intelligence agencies. Sure. MANOJ Is this kind of censorship essential for Google ? Techngro 'This signifies that the article had been verified as true by news and fact-checking organizations." It depends on what the meaning of the word 'as' is. But seriously, does anyone still trust that 'news organizations' don't twist the information that they report and 'fact check' to suit their own biases? Laurajjeske Google is paying $97 per hour!

Boy, was I wrong. I rely on a cellphone with Google Maps to find my way around. Why would I ever want to buy a GPS unit? The major maps apps are excellent, with awesome traffic information. If I’m going for a short jaunt around town, I’ll always grab my phone. But for longer trips, especially, dedicated car-GPS devices have some advantages. Like what? One big advantage is that GPS devices don’t rely on a data connection to plot a route. They have the map data stored inside. I’ve used my phone to navigate to a rural area — say, upstate Vermont — and since the app cached the original route, it got me there just fine. But when I went to navigate out, I didn’t have a data connection. So, I was out of luck. There are some apps that let you download the route and map information so you don’t have that problem, but you have to plan ahead, whereas, a GPS you keep in your glovebox is always ready to go. OK, but what does a good GPS unit cost? Is it worth that much to avoid dead zones? In our car GPS guide, we picked the Garmin Drive 51 LMT-S as the best for most people, which costs about $170. There are less expensive ones, about $100. So, yeah, it’s an investment. Still, having a GPS frees your phone for other uses, such as music or calls. And the latest GPS units are now multitasking in ways that a phone’s navigation app can’t. For example, Garmin’s entire Drive lineup can connect to a backup camera. And there are higher-end “combo models” that integrate a dashcam. Traditionally, a dashcam is primarily for keeping a record in case of an accident, but some of these new GPS models can also provide some pretty advanced safety features, such as forward-collision warnings, lane-departure alerts and even the ability to automatically send a text if there’s a crash. Those are features we’ve come to expect from new cars, but up until now were difficult to find as aftermarket add-ons for older or more basic cars. These camera-based units don’t work as well as an expensive built-in system with multiple sensors, but they’re still handy features that can help combat distracted driving. What about the colour-coded roads on Google Maps that warn of delays? And the Waze app, which warns of the police and accidents ahead? Phone apps definitely have better traffic information than GPS devices. That’s partly why I will grab my phone for around-town jaunts. The accuracy of Google Maps traffic is awesome. My wife will be checking it as I’m driving and will say, right around this bend, it turns red. And sure enough, the traffic slows way down right at that spot. GPS devices provide traffic warnings, and a lot of them also now connect to a phone via Bluetooth for “live traffic,” but they don’t measure up to Google or Waze in that regard. The better GPS units have better on-screen directions, especially at tricky interchanges, and they have more precise voice directions. While most navigation systems say “Turn on such-and-such street.” Garmins, for example, now say, “Turn at the traffic light” or even “at the red building.” This landmark-type voice guidance makes it easier to find your turn, especially when it’s not easy to see the street signs. How do you test all the different GPS device models? While we’ve compared the specs and features for more than 100 models, we’ve done three rounds of hands-on testing with about 20. Most of the nitty-gritty testing is done over weeks inside a car while we use the units for everyday driving. At times, I have mounted three units on the windshield at once to see how they compare under the same circumstances. That’s a challenge. I now record those sessions with a GoPro camera, so I can better keep my eyes on the road.

Android platform distribution for April 2017 shows another solid gain for Nougat 2017/04/06 4:00pm PDTApr 6, 2017 View All 55 Articles In This Series No one is going to claim Android updates are perfect, but Google isn't hiding anything. As it does most months, it has just updated the developer dashboard with new platform distribution numbers. Nougat is still just picking up steam, but it had another solid month of growth. The combined share of 7.0 and 7.1 is at nearly 5%. I know that doesn't sound impressive, but it's not bad historically. Here's an updated chart showing the month-to-month changes. Android version stats, April 2017 Android version Previous data (%) Current data (%) Change (pp) 2.3 1.0 0.9 -0.1 4.0 1.0 0.9 -0.1 4.1 3.7 3.5 -0.2 4.2 5.4 5.1 -0.3 4.3 1.5 1.5 0 4.4 20.8 20.0 -0.8 5.0 9.4 9.0 -0.4 5.1 23.1 23.0 -0.1 6.0 31.3 31.2 -0.1 7.0 2.4 4.5 +2.1 7.1 0.4 0.4 0 So, almost everything is down or flat, with the exception of 7.0 Nougat. Combined, Nougat is sitting at 4.9% of active devices. That's a 2.1% gain over last month, higher than the 1.6% gain we had that time. It's a little strange that Android 7.1 is flat, though. Nougat is still outpacing Marshmallow's rollout, which had hit 4.6% by this time last year. If this trend holds up, Nougat should be running on around a third of devices in a year. This month also marks the first time Marshmallow has declined. It's only down 0.1% this month, but it shows we've turned the corner on Marshmallow. It's all about Nougat now.

Another dumb title... And this is why Android is complete trash when talking about updates... :) Duder12 Yeah well not all Android are created equal so your opinion isn't really valid. Martin Yeah, some are made from candies, others from popcorn... :) The OEMs should have deadline of 1 month to give you the latest OS! Dumb Google should make them upload their Launchers in Google Store just like Nova Launcher (and others) and the updates to prime OS to come fast, and then updating their launchers... My P9 is staying with 7.0 super buggy crap and who know when it will get update with fixes and is it really gonna be fixed.. :) Duder12 It's your fault for choosing a poor OEM. Buy an Android that's updated more frequently if you care. End of discussion. Martin Yeah, everyone will Buy Pixel phones (even when they don't like them) to stay updated... Good logic /s. :) freshprince_87 Buy a Google Pixel whenever it becomes available 2 months from now in the Google Store Martin Beside Pixel all other phones are pretty damn bad when comes to updates... And most people as you see don't like Pixel :) Sruly J Of course 7.1 won't gain much. The updates going out are all 7.0 freshprince_87 All 0.4% of those phones on Android Nougat 7.1 are all Google Pixel. Google needs to do better with having more Google Pixels and the upcoming Google Pixel 2 in stock and available for me to buy. These statistics are horrible 😡 Sruly J Well...

Gabriele Molinarolo Google cannot be compared to Apple because they even fail to keep their Nexus line fully updated. That's like what, 10 models starting from the Nexus 4? saf1927 Google cannot be compared to Apple because they don't develop the SoCs in their phones unlike Apple. Qualcomm already dropped support for the 805, so there's nothing they can do. What's more interesting is that Samsung, despite developing their own in-house SoC, doesn't support their phones either. Sruly J 4, 5, 5X, 6, 6P, 7 (2012), 7 (2013), 9, 10. And that's excluding other devices with Nexus branding. Snowsky419 The 5X and 6P are still getting updates. So is the Player, FWIW. Sruly J I know. I misread the context of the comment which I replied to. Leonardo Baez There is no comparison point. Apple is the only manufacturer that uses iOS. Rod Pixel's update chart must look something like that, though. M. Luciano Way more than 79% of Pixel users are using Nougat.... Tr3ple It's 100%, Pixel launched with 7.1 alexio92 Thank you LineageOS 14.1! 💚 freshprince_87 Lol thank you for what, you guys are only 0.0001% of that 0.4% marcusmarcus2 Really? You don't know? It's not thank you for getting that Nougat percents higher. It's thank you for getting us into that 0.4% instead of leaving us behind in one of the other percentages of lower Android versions. freshprince_87 Yeah sure. Your percentage is still extremely small regardless of if you're flashing LineageOS or using a Pixel/Nexus/OP3T .Btw most people with android devices do not flash custom ROMs marcusmarcus2 I'm not disagreeing with what percentage of lineage is. Still, thank you LinageOS for helping us users that do flash custom ROM even if we are a small number of people. What does it matter what most people do with their devices? I'm not speaking for most people. I'm speaking for myself. I'm saying thank you from me, not thank you for other people. Railwayman I think some people are obsessed with being mainstream. It is only when their whole neighbor block buy something or install something or do something that this *something* gets relevant to them. Argumentum ad Populum is the only way they know. In the reality where I live, a ROM is available when it is available. Its existence, usefulness, value etc isn't determined by what 'most people' use or do. Railwayman I wonder why Argumentum ad Populum is so popular? Why is it so important to talk about 'most people', 'regular people' or 'ordinary people' in this 'classic' way? Lineage OS and other ROMs *do exist* and counts, regardless of whether 'most people' flash them or use their device as a fishing tool. The most annoying part is statements such as: 'ROM X doesn't count because of... most people... doesn't do this or that'. Reality check: It doesn't matter. The availability of a ROM with Android Y.Z simply means that the device for which this ROM is available *has access* to the version, regardless of what version the OEM has been stuck on. Those arguments about 'most people' should stop. It doesn't make it less correct to say that 'Android X.Y is available for Z' EVEN if 'most people' do whatever [insert argument of choice] or doesn't do whatever [insert argument of choice]. It is like saying 'saying that there are blue cars are wrong since 'most people TM' buy blue cars'. AbbyZFresh Fragmentation will forever be Android's flaw as an OS. freshprince_87 The lack of Google Pixel available is part of the reason for this continued fragmentation Zsolt V Actually, no, since essentially all OS features are backported to 4.3 via the Support Library. So no worse then iOS that simply omits features. Rod What about security fixes? saf1927 Well, that's not really related to fragmentation. You can have a phone on Nougat running the February patch and one on Marshmallow running an April patch. It's up to the OEMs but then again, this is a security issue rather than fragmentation. Rod But you gotta agree with me, that iPhones are always running the latest security patches. Leonardo Baez nope. apple doesnt relase monthly updates Rod Apple releases updates almost weekly. Zsolt V No they do not. Stop lying. Rod There's no certain date. But the updates come frequently. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history Zsolt V On Android there is a monthly security patch, so it's actually better than "frequently" Rod On Google devices* Zsolt V No, you are uniformed. Try again. Rod Show me what devices receive monthly updates apart from the Google ones, then. PS: Samsung promised to do it, but didn't start yet. Zsolt V What about them? Every reputable OEMsoffers security fixes independent on base OS updates. tim242 Being on different OS versions does not equal fragmentation. Rod How so? tim242 Because apps work on all of them. Apps get updated and play services gets updated. Somebody using Jellybean or Marshmallow is not any worse off than a Nougat user. I hate Nougat. I wish I was back on Marshmallow. Contrary to popular belief, ios is more fragmented. Updates for older devices are in number only. They get features stripped out that are not hardware dependent, and performance takes a big hit. Rod Well, but there are features that rely on the system API. GPS can't change that. raptir They're few and far between compared to iOS though. Hearing iOS users talk about how they can't wait to update to the new version to get new features in Maps is baffling since all of the system apps are updated via the Play Store on Android. Rod Yeah. At least they know they'll get the update eventually. My1 why do you hate nougat? Alejandro Because there's no Xposed for it. My1 not yet or straight impossible? Alejandro Not yet, the man says he's working on it. But...it's already been too long. I could've installed nougat a month ago but still haven't because of this. My1 yeah I am still on L I could M but so far I was too lazy to check whether everything on my note 4 would work then xposed on samsung was already quite an affair in L Leonardo Baez That is the literal meaning of OS fragmentation. tim242 There is no literal meaning of OS fragmentation, as it is a made up term. But the meaning given to the term by bloggers referred to it being a negative, with not all versions able to run the same apps and services. That issue was solved years ago. Colin Richardson I wonder how many individual versions of Android has more users than iOS in total? Ra1nb0wD4sh DE I wonder which one will die first - Gingerbread or ICS? So excited for this new Deathwatch. AbbyZFresh Considering how long it took Froyo to finally die out from 0.1%, don't expect Gingerbread or ICS to die for at least another 3 years. Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Yeah, probably. Thinking about 3 years... I can't think of an good name for Android Q. Gregor Smith Gingerbread came out in 2010, TWENTY TEN! What is dead may never die Sruly J So did Froyo, and it only dropped off the chart this past January. Delta Wolf But it's not going to rise again harder and stronger... I hope. Gaurav Arora Looking at Froyo's pattern, I doubt it till die before 2019 letsplaay Hm time to power up my Froyo device. Nate Behary I'd bet 7.1 numbers are flat for 2 reasons. Pixel sales I'd bet are slowing, and while not huge, there are probably a decent number of people who have them running the O DP. (just enough to negate the effect of new devices) k0n Still, if it is flat, it means that the updates to other devices and new devices keep up with the general pace of the market growth. Gotmilo Samsung are now releasing the updates that are delayed by oem itself and carriers. That's why there is a slight jump Leonardo Baez Still more Jelly Beans users than Nougat. 🤕 freshprince_87 That's a damn shame 😡 Leonardo Baez Yes it is. Kevin Davis Wow. SMH. Knowledgeborn Allah "If this trend holds up, Nougat should be running on around a third of devices in a year." This statement says it all... 😳 In other words, theoretically, around 33% of Android devices will, hopefully, be running 7.0 Nougat by the time Google releases the developer preview for Android 9.0 P. Great news, right? 👍🏾 TechGuy22 pathetic Rod I hope that by 2025, we will look at this and laugh, because all phones now run the exact same OS in a separate partition and every OEM/carrier can put their crap without interfering with the core system updates. Edward Palomares Jr Google needs to send out beta invites much earlier or at least straight to the OEM to test before beta because 6 months later I still don't have Android n on galaxy s6edge T-Mobile..Google should have all oems try and put on a 30 day guarantee for updates because it's 2017 and it's just ridiculous now,lg,HTC,Samsung need to get with Google on this. saf1927 OEMs already receive early builds of Android before public release. They are simply slow regardless. ast00 Nougat is on less than 5% of devices, but we already have the O preview. Good job manufacturers! Atoqir The rise is purely Samsung their doing. That is why 7.0 is going up but 7.1 remains the same. Tech Mate Does the rooted ones also count in this list or just the OTA ones? freshprince_87 Probably the OTA versions Adeel Ejaz What I find more interesting is what dropped the most. KitKat with a drop of 0.8% means a lot of folks ran out of their contracts and moved to a newer phone. The rest with drop of 0.1% seems to be just adjusting to increase in devices running Nougat. What is worrying though is Jellybean 4.3 didn't drop, which means numbers of devices running Jellybean increased!? Leeav Amar Still nearly 10% on JB and 20 on KK (30% in the 4.X era). Over 30% on LP and another 30%+ on MM leave less than 10% scraps for Nougat. It's clear that the way Android "upgrades" are handled for most people means the old device died so your grandma finally upgraded her Galaxy S2 from 2011 running JB 4.1.2 (true story) Testraindrop So no new Pixels sold compared to last month? 7.1 +0% raptir Well they're still sold out, what did you expect? :) It actually doesn't mean that, it just means that Pixels did not grow compared to the total number of other devices. You still have plenty of new devices being sold on 6.x and 7.0 that would offset the Pixels on 7.1. subins mani Will google count lineageos 14.1 on their "Android Plateform Distribution"??? And how google count this all,,, Crazy question,,, :P raptir They're likely collected via devices that are active on Google Play Services, so even custom ROMs like LineageOS would be included. That said... it wouldn't affect anything. LineageOS reports that they have 1.3 million active installs and Android has over 1.4 billion users.That comes out to less than one tenth of one percent of Android users running LineageOS. androwin Thank you sony for making me stuck on Marshmallow @zzholes they didn't update Z2/Z3 to Nougat while I heard Samsung updated even the old Note 4. Sony? NEVER again. Snowsky419 The Note 4 isn't getting an official Nougat update AFAIK. (Not 100% sure though...) PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Marshmallow we're kings! CAN'T TOUCH THIS XD Nuno G. Oh yeah!!! Pixel sold off the chart!!!! Yeah!!! Ahahah kjohnson04 The Droid Turbo 2 I found last month got an update to 7.0, not 7.1, despite it being the most recent. AP has dozens of articles about updates where the carrier or the manufacturer gleefully update the phone to an older version. Even Google fouled this one up with the Nexus 6 (OTA, then force 7.0 on phones). I wonder why 7.1 is flat... Alan Goldman wow, that is really pathetic. Google really needs to get a grasp on this OS update thing. It's embarrassing. Syukri Lajin i wonder how valid this platform distribution is. is the newer version increased at a faster rate because of more phones are being updated to android nougat, or because more people are buying phones released with nougat? i barely hear any phones except for the [some] flagships receiving nougat update, while smartphone sales kept on increasing every year.

Victims are being targeted with viruses or even software that can record sensitive passwords and beam it back to the hackers, with concerns that vulnerable, less tech-savvy Brits are losing out. Getty Images 1 Hackers are employing more and more devious ways to target their victims Experts have now warned people to hang up if they are told they are being called by big tech companies like Google and Microsoft, or asked any personal details about their passwords. Security researcher David Jacoby told The Daily Star: “Phone scammers are a huge problem because they’re very difficult to stop and to monitor. “We don’t really have any insight into how they work, how much money they make, which countries are targeted and so on.” But he warned that peopled targeted could be assured that Microsoft and Apple representatives would never call home to warn of a virus.

A mum recently spoke out to The Sun Online, recounting how she lost thousands of pounds in a smishing scam. Top tips to protect yourself from scams NEVER give out personal or financial information on the phone or by email. Your bank, the police or any other organisation will never ask you for these in full. Never allow someone remote access to your computer following a cold call Don’t rely on caller ID – numbers can be spoofed by fraudsters to make it look like they’re calling from a trusted number Your bank, the police or any other company, will never call to ask you to transfer your money out of your account for security reasons Be wary of all cold calls claiming to be from banks, police, or other trusted organisations – if you have any concerns, call back on an independently verified number If you have fallen victim to a scam, call Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 The Financial Ombudsman said from April 1, 2015, to February 8, 2017, said they had received around 6,000 new complaints about disputed transactions – where a person has complained there has been fraud on their account.

Google releases Android Things Developer Preview 3 Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 1:18pm PDTApr 6, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 64 Share on Facebook 64 Share on Twitter Total Shares147 Android Things Development News Fast on the heels of Developer Preview 2, Google has just pushed out their latest Developer Preview for Android Things, the IoT embedded platform based on Android. Android Things was released at I/O in 2015 originally under the codename Brillo, and was meant to give existing Android developers a platform for embedded devices through the same tools and Android SDK they already know. At its most basic level Android Things is the same Android we all know and love applied to embedded devices like smart lights, doorbells, thermostats—that sort of thing—with some of the same APIs and tools that Android developers have used for years. After all, easy development makes for happy and prolific developers. Unfortunately there aren't any commercial devices running Android Things just yet. Google has stayed quiet thus far about hardware and commercial partners, and apart from Qualcomm announcing their support it's an empty list, but devices are certainly coming. In the meantime, Developer Preview 3 brings with it a host of new features, such as support for a new hardware platform, Android Bluetooth API support, and USB host mode for devices. Bluetooth support is fairly integral to the future of embedded device development so that's no shocker, and that plus USB host mode is certainly going to come in handy with any peripherals devices might use in the future. Developers, engineers, and the casually curious can all satiate themselves at the links below. Source: Android Developers, Android Developers Blog.

What happened to that? Dn Bro I am not a developer but I like to poke around with this kind of stuff. I tried this on my raspberry pi and nothing really happened. Android things loaded up and that was it. I'm curious about what should happen on a raspberry pi? Christian K. Kaderud That's it. To make it useful you'd need to develop an app to do something, for example measure the temperature and send it to a database for a smartphone companion app to read. JG Unfortunately there aren't any commercial devices running Android Things just yet. Google has stayed quiet thus far about hardware and commercial partners, and apart from Qualcomm announcing their support it's an empty list, but devices are certainly coming. We've seen hints that Google has a third device, taimen, up their sleeves... All we know at the moment is its a separate project from the two Pixel phones. Due to the size of its namesake, we're assuming it'll be a phablet or possibly a tablet... But what if it turns out to be a reference device for Android Things... Android Things is a light weight version of Android designed to run on lower spec'd devices right... Like maybe a 200-level Snapdragon processor (to draw back to the Qualcomm partnership)... I know this'll fall into the "not going to happen" and "wishful thinking" categories... But after hearing plans for a reboot on the Nokia 3310, I've become kind of interested in what Google might do if they were tasked with designing an Android (or Android Things) powered feature phone. Either something completely new - the G-Flip or maybe, since Google owned Motorola and kept its patents, if they have the rights to it, maybe reboot the Razr flip phone as it was a popular must have device in the day - they could partner with Lenovo so they could even get the Moto batwing logo on it. It comes equipped with all the standard phone services, as android apps. Address Book syncs to my Google Contacts, the photo gallery is Google Photos, etc. They could extract the Flappy Droids easter eggs from L/M for a Snake replacement. WalterPinkman > an Android powered feature phone. Qualcomm has done that, the phone will hopefully launch this year in Indonesia. Price tag is around IDR 500k http://www.pcworld.com/article/3182563/phones/candy-bar-phones-will-get-smartphone-features-with-new-qualcomm-chip.html (In Indonesian): http://tekno.kompas.com/read/2017/02/28/16440047/ponsel.rp.500.000-an.qualcomm.pakai.android.dan.bisa.whatsapp JG I've seen articles on Qualcomm's 205 platform, but I hadn't heard there was a phone in production to. Thanks for sharing that. I like the look of the phone they were showing... But I think I probably would have gone back to the flip phone form factor myself. Everyone has a generic candy bar of some kind now. Going back to the old flip design would help set the device apart even farther. But I think I would still prefer to see Google actually produce one. One thing that really put me off this phone was the fact they're going to use KitKat or possibly, at most, Lollipop to power it. Sure, a feature phone wouldn't need the latest and greatest OS. But there could be potential security issues using an older OS and since it sounds like they're not planning on updating it too often... And the newer versions of Android have useful features. Like M and N's Doze mode. And O is getting better keyboard and D-Pad support (which would be a feature phone's primary input). They claim on-board storage limitations is the issue. But I don't think that's a super legit excuse. My freshly restored Nexus 9 uses 7.4GBs of storage with just the updated version of everything Google ships on it. The system partition takes up 3.5GBs, so if you double that for N's seamless update you're looking at around 11GBs, so a 16GB chip with a microSD to augment it (especially with M's adaptive storage) would just be enough.
