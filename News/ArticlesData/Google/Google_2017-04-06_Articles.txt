This works similar to Google Assistant in Google Allo where the AI framework from Google suggests the users in responses, search queries and other things. You can also talk to Google Assistant in its own chat window in addition to invoking it in any conversation. ‘Suggestions from M’ will work as part of AI assistant which will suggest features from Facebook and other apps on your smartphone depending on the context of the conversation. The feature can not be invoked in the conversation as a third party agent but instead of being intrusive, the assistant will suggest actions and responses to you and those suggested actions or responses will not be visible to the other user unless you respond using the suggested actions. Image Credit: Facebook These suggestions range from the assistant suggesting you to send your location when a person asks ‘Where are you?’ or asking you to set a reminder when they send ‘Let’s meet tomorrow at 6:30 PM’ or suggest you a GIF for ‘bye-bye’ when the user on the other end says ‘Goodbye’. The app can also suggest payment options to send money if the conversation is around money owed or needed in addition to ridesharing options from Uber or Lyft as reported by TechCrunch. This feature is rolling out for Facebook Messenger users in the United States today on both iOS and Android. You can choose to not use the suggestions suggested by the Assistant and it will not show the suggestions prominently or choose to show what you previously selected as the default response. The assistant learns about what a particular user prefers and changes the suggestions accordingly. For instance, if you use a lot of stickers or emojis in your conversations to respond to messages, ‘Suggestions by M’ will include emojis and stickers. You can also choose to mute or turn off certain kinds of recommendations from the messenger settings. One thing to note is that the suggestions are limited to internal Facebook Messenger features but they will be expanded to include other apps outside Facebook Messenger like Instagram, Uber, Lyft in near future. As reported earlier, Facebook added M as an AI to converse with back in 2015.

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares133 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu have led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on-board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks. Carson Saldanha ?` Shawn Spring I'm hoping this and Nick Jr (for the kiddos) comes sooner rather than later! freshprince_87 I hope they add it soon Lateef Alabi-Oki I think the nailed the user interface.

Tucker Sferro $35 is outrageous. You might as well jest get cable. Jacob Fulbright After you add in YouTube Red, Netflix, Hulu (or the ad-free premium Hulu), HBO GO, etc., yeah, cable isn't looking so bad anymore. Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 | MYT 1:23 PM Alphabet moves two top Google Fiber executives off project The removal of the two Google Fiber execs is but the latest sign of the business pulling back from ambitious, expensive goals. — Reuters Alphabet Inc’s Access division, which houses its broadband service Google Fiber, has removed two prominent executives from its ranks, the latest sign of the business pulling back from ambitious, expensive goals.  Milo Medin, a vice-president at Access, and Dennis Kish, a wireless infrastructure veteran who was president of Google Fiber, are leaving the division but staying at the Alphabet holding company. Gregory McCray, who was appointed head of Access in February, told staff about the management changes at a Thursday meeting. An Access spokesman confirmed the changes, but declined to comment further.  Kish joined Google Fiber in 2014 from Qualcomm Inc and worked closely with fellow transplant Craig Barratt, who previously led the Access group. Barratt suddenly exited in October, when Alphabet also announced it was halting Google Fiber expansions in eight major urban markets and laying off around 10% of its staff.  The Access division has continued to shrink. About 600 employees are currently being reassigned to the Google Internet business and other Alphabet divisions, according to sources familiar with the plans.  A Google veteran since 2010, Medin was a chief advocate for the company’s high-speed Fiber service in Washington. He has also been leading some of Alphabet’s more experimental efforts to tap wireless spectrum for better internet delivery. It’s unclear if that effort will move to another part of Alphabet.  On April 6, Medin was named as a member of the Federal Communications Commission’s new Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee.  Medin and Kish didn’t respond to e-mailed requests for comment.  Under Barratt, Alphabet pushed to bring Fiber to more than a dozen US cities. It hit some hurdles, including increased competition and legal challenges from telecommunications firms. Google Fiber also grew into one of the costliest efforts for the company, outside of the dominant Google Internet business.  After halting its expansion, some analysts praised Alphabet for implementing cost-cutting measures. Last month, Google Fiber cancelled some planned installations in Kansas City, its first market. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested UTAR among top young varsities Speculation driving up tech stocks on Bursa, but many don't want to miss the party Joy over bumper harvest Don't tear down Ampang Park for MRT, say traders Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Bargains aplenty at Perfect Livin ’17 expo 60 lucky homeowners enjoy scenic ride in hot air balloon Copter ‘quietly’ attracts interest advertisement Latest News Hyundai, Kia plan major car recall in US and S.

All you need to know about the new AI assistant Unlike Siri and Cortana, M is not operated by voice commands. By Agamoni Ghosh Updated April 7, 2017 06:21 BST Facebook M is the social media's new AI assistantFacebook Facebook has announced the rollout of its AI assistant called M for its Messenger. The latest assistant based on AI machine learning technology competes with Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana and the recently-launched Samsung Bixby. Here's what you need to know about the latest Facebook product. M offers a few quick shortcuts for some commonly used features -- sending money, stickers, planning events, sharing location, or hailing a ride. Which means you can now do all this without getting out of the messenger screen. Like Google Assistant, it provides suggestions based on the content of messages you send and receive. What is different in Facebook M? It is an AI assistant, but unlike the popular ones like Siri, it does not have a voice command function. M is an inbuilt feature in Messenger and works like a digital assistant, suggesting relevant content to help users communicate better. M can give helpful suggestions while you are chatting, somewhat similar to Google Allo's inbuilt Assistant feature, which also provides suggestions and reminders. What can M do? Facebook claims M is not any other ordinary messenger, and can help users perform utility tasks based on the conversation they have with friends and family. Take a look at what M can do: Sending stickers: It automatically detects spaces in conversations where a sticker is needed and sends one on its own Paying or requesting money: It gives users the option to send and receive money Sharing your location: Just like the Google Assistant, if M spots location in a conversation, it suggests an option to share the location Making plans: A calendar-like feature is incorporated to track your day Conducting polls: Useful in large group conversations. M helps users can create polls to make decisions faster. Hailing a ride: M has teamed up with ride-sharing companies such as Lyft and Uber to suggest a ride when required Is M optional? Like many features in Facebook, M too is optional. If you do not want M's assistance, you can simply mute it by going to M Settings. Is it available for me? As of now, Facebook M is available for Messenger users in the US on both Android and iOS platforms. The AI assistant will eventually be rolled out to other countries.

The data is collected during a 7-day period that ended on April 3, and it only represents devices that have visited the Google Play Store during that period, so to be clear, it does not include AOSP devices. Version Codename API Last month This month Change 2.3.3 - 2.3.7 Gingerbread 10 1.0% 0.9% -0.1 4.0.3 - 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich 15 1.0% 0.9% -0.1 4.1.x Jelly Bean 16 3.7% 3.5% -0.2 4.2.x 17 5.4% 5.1% -0.3 4.3 18 1.5% 1.5% - 4.4 KitKat 19 20.8% 20.0% -0.8 5.0 Lollipop 21 9.4% 9.0% -0.4 5.1 22 23.1% 23.0% -0.1 6.0 Marshmallow 23 31.3% 31.2% -0.1 7.0 Nougat 24 2.4% 4.5% 2.1 7.1 25 0.4% 0.4% - Obviously, the only winner this month was Android 7.0 Nougat, which saw an 87.5% increase in usage to 4.5%, although this isn't exactly a number to brag about when the OS was released almost eight months ago. But what seems to be even worse is that the latest version of the OS, 7.1 Nougat, remains stagnant at 0.4%, despite having been released almost five months ago. Marshmallow showed its first loss, which should hopefully be an indication that it's now the time for Nougat to grow, even though it's a small loss of 0.1. Lollipop still combines for the highest share of a codename at 32%, beating out Marshmallow by a narrow margin. Jelly Bean and KitKat continued their patterns of loses, so next month, you'll likely see them fall below 10% and 20%, respectively. What's more interesting is that both Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich both lost 0.1 after remaining at 1.0% for months. Since Nougat is finally beginning to gain some traction, that means one thing: Android O is right around the corner. Indeed, Google has already announced it and released a Developer Preview. You won't see it on the usage breakdown until it's on over 0.1% of Google Play devices, which will probably be later this year in the third quarter when it's released.

Released today, Developer Preview 3 finally adds the biggest feature request from developers, as well as more connectivity options over USB. Nintendo Switch The development team noted back in February that it was actively working on bringing Bluetooth to the IoT platform. Finally with DP3, there is support for those existing Android APIs for both Bluetooth Classic and Low Energy. Code for phones and other devices can run unmodified on Android Things, with features like Bluetooth LE advertisements and scanning and Bluetooth LE GATT working seamlessly. Google’s goal with the platform is to allow developers to easily make IoT devices with their existing knowledge of Android and its related services. USB host in DP3 now allows Android Things to interface easily with custom USB devices without the need for root privileges or support from the Linux kernel. Similar to other connectivity methods, existing code supporting USB host will work natively. Lastly, this version adds support for NXP’s Argon i.MX6UL platform. With the addition of Intel Joule in DP2, Android Things supports five IoT platforms in total. DP3 system images are now available for download and install.

The efforts center around training artificial neural networks with data that’s stored locally on devices, as opposed to in the cloud. Samsung U28E590D 28-Inch 4K Monitor Google calls this idea federated learning and it’s something its employees have been working on for awhile now, having published two academic papers on the subject. The privacy system underneath the neural network is referred to as secure aggregation. Similar to the approach Apple takes when handling artificial intelligence and machine learning, federated learning decreases reliance on the cloud and thus puts a stronger focus on a user’s privacy. Here’s how Google describes federated learning on its Google Research Blog: Federated Learning enables mobile phones to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all the training data on device, decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud. As for how the process works, Google explains that it starts by looking at the current model of data stored in the cloud. From there, it is improved by what’s on your phone, then summarized as a “small focused update.” All of the training data remains on your device and what’s sent to the cloud is an update to the original model: Your device downloads the current model, improves it by learning from data on your phone, and then summarizes the changes as a small focused update. Only this update to the model is sent to the cloud, using encrypted communication, where it is immediately averaged with other user updates to improve the shared model. All the training data remains on your device, and no individual updates are stored in the cloud. More info can be read on Google’s Research Blog.

Quotes in the article Qualcomm Inc QCOM ▲ 56.53 +0.06 +0.11% Milo Medin, a vice president at Access, and Dennis Kish, a wireless infrastructure veteran who was president of Google Fiber, are leaving the division but staying at the Alphabet holding company. Gregory McCray, who was appointed head of Access in February, told staff about the management changes at a Thursday meeting. An Access spokesman confirmed the changes, but declined to comment further. Kish joined Google Fiber in 2014 from Qualcomm Inc. and worked closely with fellow transplant Craig Barratt, who previously led the Access group. Barratt suddenly exited in October, when Alphabet also announced it was halting Google Fiber expansions in eight cities and laying off around 10 percent of its staff. After McCray joined, the Access division grew even smaller. About 600 employees are currently being reassigned to the Google internet business and other Alphabet divisions, according to sources familiar with the plans. Medin’s departure from the division is more telling. A Google veteran since 2010, Medin was a chief advocate for the company’s high-speed fiber service in Washington. More recently, he has been leading some of Alphabet’s more experimental efforts to tap wireless spectrum for better internet delivery. It’s unclear if that effort will move to another part of Alphabet. Medin and Kish didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

Noting that an Aadhaar identity has been provided to over 113 crore people from the launch of the program in 2010, Bhushan pointed out that the Aadhaar database is adequately secured and there has been no breach in the central database so far. On 15 February, 2017, UIDAI filed a police complaint against Axis bank, Suvidha Infoserve and eMudhra over an attempted fraudulent authentication and impersonation with the Aadhaar system. Following reports of the attempted breach, the UIDAI reaffirmed that there has been no breach in the central Aadhaar database. In the CNBC TV18 interview, Bhushan responded to concerns of data security, but did not address the issues surrounding data privacy. Bhushan pointed out the flawless track record of the UIDAI so far, saying “not a single case of data leak from the UIDAI, data breach from UIDAI, not a single case of identity theft or financial loss has been reported to us. So, this is the only thing that I would like to say and then the people should make a judgment whether Aadhaar is safe or not.” On 22 March, 2017, A Medium post by the user St_Hill pointed out four major concerns with the Aadhaar program. One of the concerns raised that a simple search on Google revealed a number of databases that contained sensitive personal information, including bank accounts and Aadhaar numbers. Some of the databases were from .gov.in domains, which showed that various government web sites were leaking sensitive information they had collected. Users on Reddit pointed out that many of the databases were being pulled, especially from Government owned web sites. There was no expectation of an official statement. A banner is up on the UIDAI web site reminding all agencies collecting Aadhaar information that it was illegal to make the information available on public portals. Bhushan pointed out that under the Aadhaar Act, it was an offence to publicly publish an Aadhaar number, and that publishing bank account numbers was an offense under the Income Tax act. An example of a excel sheet available after a Google search, with information on underage students. In the interview, Bhushan indicated some of the measures being taken, saying “So, that is what the government, last week, gave an advisory to all ministries of the central government and also the state government saying that please be vigilant, be respectful to the privacy of people and do not publish such data including Aadhaar, including bank account details and other things because we need to respect the privacy of the people whom you try to serve.” The banner on the UIDAI site. Another question raised was if a dedicated privacy bill has the potential to settle some of the concerns over database security. India has no dedicated laws for privacy, or the security of databases. Bhushan responded by pointing out that as far as the Aadhaar database was concerned, the necessary data protection laws were built into the Aadhaar Act itself. “So, far as the Aadhaar Act is concerned, this whole privacy protection features have been inbuilt into the Aadhaar Act itself. For example Aadhaar Act Section 29 describes what privacy protection measures are there,” Bhushan said. There were concerns of sensitive information being leaked from the collection agency itself. Bhushan said that, “At the time of collection of Aadhaar number and biometric that agency has to disclose the purpose for which Aadhaar number is being collected. Then this Aadhaar number can be used only for the purpose which was disclosed to that resident. In case if there is any violation then again it is a serious offence under the Aadhaar Act.” @rsprasad @CSCegov_ is there any privacy left ??? Information of adhaar card including application is made public property!#disappointed — Sakshi Singh 🇮🇳❤️ (@SaakshiSRawat) March 28, 2017 An overenthusiastic employee at an Aadhaar enrollment center publicly tweeted out sensitive information about cricketer MS Dhoni. The tweet with the sensitive information was subsequently retweeted by the IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. On 28 March 2017, cricketer MS Dhoni’s wife, Sakshi Dhoni pointed out on Twitter that the sensitive information had been publicly tweeted. The agency was subsequently blacklisted for ten years. @rsprasad Sir I m talking about the application which was tweeted along with picture by @CSCegov_ pic.twitter.com/EHYwzfzfKR — Sakshi Singh 🇮🇳❤️ (@SaakshiSRawat) March 28, 2017 Ravi Shankar Prasad responded by tweeting that “Thanks for bringing this to my notice. Sharing personal information is illegal. Serious action will be taken against this.” He went on to note that there was no breach in the Aadhaar database, and that Aadhaar is secure. Bhushan was asked about the concerns by citizens and the opposition parties over Aadhaar being used for distribution of Government benefits. Bhushan pointed out that to continue receiving the benefits, it was either necessary to have an Aadhaar card, or enroll for one. The ruling in question says that the lack of an Aadhaar card is no reason for people not to receive benefits, till such time as they get one. The ruling also goes on to add that the government cannot be stopped from using Aadhaar card for documentation purposes, such as the filing of income tax returns. As far as citizens having to hurry to enroll for Aadhaar within stipulated deadlines for PAN card, filing IT returns, and getting a driving license, Bhushan pointed out that UIDAI had nothing to do with the deadlines the various departments have come up with. “So far as the use of Aadhaar is concerned, the use is governed by the rules of those user departments and we do not have any say in that. For example, if the income tax department has said that by such and such date, you should link your Aadhaar to the PAN card, it is the discretion or the jurisdiction of income tax department,” Bhushan said. Essentially, the responses were rehashes of how the UIDAI and associated parties have been responding to criticisms from the very inception of the program. That the UIDAI database is adequately secured, and that there are no problems with the Aadhaar program, and that it has been a roaring success. Fundamental problems with biometric security, such as marginal failure rate that can potentially affect tens of thousands in the population the size of India, and the potential for invasive surveillance by the government were not addressed. It is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible for citizens to choose not to get an Aadhaar card. A central database such as Aadhaar, no matter how well secured, is a high value target for malicious actors and state sponsored hackers. Indian laws will find it difficult to hold breaches from foreign sources accountable. Fundamental information security problems anyway cannot be solved by throwing harsh laws at them.

Mark Bergen Google Fiber also grew into one of the costliest efforts for the company, outside of the dominant Google internet business. Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco: Alphabet Inc.’s Access division, which houses its broadband service Google Fiber, has removed two prominent executives from its ranks, the latest sign of the business pulling back from ambitious, expensive goals. Milo Medin, a vice president at Access, and Dennis Kish, a wireless infrastructure veteran who was president of Google Fiber, are leaving the division but staying at the Alphabet holding company. Gregory McCray, who was appointed head of Access in February, told staff about the management changes at a Thursday meeting.

Kish joined Google Fiber in 2014 from Qualcomm Inc. and worked closely with fellow transplant Craig Barratt, who previously led the Access group. Barratt suddenly exited in October, when Alphabet also announced it was halting Google Fiber expansions in eight major urban markets and laying off around 10% of its staff. The Access division has continued to shrink. About 600 employees are currently being reassigned to the Google internet business and other Alphabet divisions, according to sources familiar with the plans. A Google veteran since 2010, Medin was a chief advocate for the company’s high-speed Fiber service in Washington.

Medin and Kish didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment. Under Barratt, Alphabet pushed to bring Fiber to more than a dozen US cities. It hit some hurdles, including increased competition and legal challenges from telecommunications firms. Google Fiber also grew into one of the costliest efforts for the company, outside of the dominant Google internet business. After halting its expansion, some analysts praised Alphabet for implementing cost-cutting measures. Last month, Google Fiber cancelled some planned installations in Kansas City, its first market.

Google's phone prompts for 2-step verification are getting updated to show more info Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/02/22 1:48pm PDTFeb 22, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares122 Google News Back in June of last year, Google introduced two-step verification prompts to mobile devices. This made using two-factor authentication a lot easier, since it formerly required you to enter codes every single time. However, these prompts looked pretty barren and showed little to no information about the device that was requesting access to your Google account. Now, though, Google is updating them to fix that issue.   left: Current. right: New. Please excuse the crappy quality of the picture that Google provided. While the prompt formerly only allowed you to select yes or no, the updated version will also display the device that is being used to sign in (for "Janelle," a MacBook Pro using Chrome), a rough location and IP address, and a time. The "No" button is also being switched to a more friendly "No, it's not me," but that's obviously less important. These changes will be rolling out at a gradual pace to both Android and iOS devices, so don't panic if you don't see them in the next few days. If you haven't enabled this convenient method of 2FA, you can see a help page about it here. Source: Google Tags 2-step verification 2sv authorization Google prompts subscribe ...

I guess you've got to have pretty bad luck that someone scams one of these at EXACTLY the same time you request one yourself. Andr3ww Are you sure this feature is rolling out to iOS? Because I only have the Google Authenticator app that doesn't prompt me when I'm trying to sign in from another device. It just shows numbers that constantly refresh. Maybe I'm missing something. Ben Godfrey You aren't signed up for the new 2FA method. See this helpdesk article: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7026266?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en&oco=0 Andr3ww Thank you! I had a feeling there was something missing. Jaspah I'm pretty sure you need the actual "Google" app (not authenticator). Andr3ww Thank you! cadtek91 This isn't part of the Authenticator app. David Hyman Google prompt is so much better than the sms code. I hope everything moves that way in the future Impulse_Vigil I've never had issues myself with the SMS code, Android often picks up the message in the background and reads the code itself IIRC. Never even messed with the app. However I've had issues with clients and family members on AT&T not receiving the SMS from Google, those voice calls announcing the number get old real fast when you're in an office setting up half a dozen email accounts on several devices. Jason Pagliaro Not sure how Microsoft manages to still do this better on Android than Google, but they do. The option to approve or deny in the notification drawer by MS is so much cleaner, in my opinion. cadtek91 I mean this is basically the exact same thing. It pops up, push a button and it goes away. Jason Pagliaro The notification drawer is the real difference for me. Madis I guess the full page is done so that apps that access notifications couldn't interact with that. Jason Pagliaro I legitimately didn't know that was a thing. You can have one app interact with the notifications of another or am not understanding this? Roh_Mish you can use notification access API to interact with and clear notifications. That said, you could also use screen overlays and stuff to accomplish the same.

Earlier this year, Google confirmed an Android 7.1.2 update for its Pixel and Nexus-branded devices. The company then put the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update into beta ahead of an unannounced release for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and others. In early April, Google pulled the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Nougat update from beta and began rolling it out to device owners around the world. Android 7.1.2 isn’t as big as Android 7.1.1 or Android 7.0 but it’s an important update for the Nexus 5X and that’s precisely why we’re taking a close look at it today. The Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update is a maintenance release which means its focused on improving performance. That said, it also comes with some brand new features including a useful fingerprint scanner gesture. It’s a substantial release for the Nexus 5X. Today we want to go over the most important things you know to know, right now, about the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update, its roll out, its problems, and its performance. We also include some tips that might help you get through the update unscathed. Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 We recently received the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update Over-the-Air (OTA), a sign that Google's roll out is making progress.  If you're waiting for the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 OTA, here are a few things to know about the download/installation process.  The device's Android 7.1.2 update is several hundred MB. It took us a couple of minutes to download over a high-speed Wi-Fi network. The installation process took much longer, around 10 minutes or so. We recommend putting aside 15-20 minutes to monitor the Android 7.1.2 download and installation. We didn't run into any problems but you might.  We've been using the update for only a short time but so far, the Android 7.1.2 update has been performing well on our Nexus 5X.  Battery life is excellent. We haven't noticed any weird drain during our time with the new software. Connectivity is also strong and we haven't noticed any issues with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cellular data. At least not yet.  The phone's UI is still fast. That's important for a device that was first released all the way back in 2015. Hard to believe its been that long since launch.  We haven't run into any bugs or serious problems but again we've only been using the Android 7.1.2 update for a couple of days now.  Given what's on board (security patches, new features, bug fixes) and given its steady performance, you'll definitely want to consider installing it on your Nexus 5X.  If you're having a pleasant experience on Android 7.1.2 or below, be sure to take your time. Dig into additional feedback if you start feeling leery. We'll be back with long term feedback about its performance next week.    1 / 9 2 Responses 04/05/2017 Joe Reply I encountered some serious problems with 7.1.2 on my Nexus 6P, so much so that I had to roll back to 7.1.1. Furthermore, when I rolled back, I repeatedly saw dialog boxes telling me that a system app (I think something with the word “core” in the name) had crashed; every time I’d dismiss one, another would pop up. I had to do a factory reset to eliminate the problem. Anyway, the problems I experienced with 7.1.2 were: no notification (status) bar; no ability to access Quick Settings or notifications except from the home screen; the background, text, and icons in Quick Settings were all white, making them nearly unreadable (fortunately, the text/icons and background were a slightly different shade of white from each other!); USB audio was broken, resulting in my USB audio interface crashing my USB audio applications. 04/06/2017 sohil shriyan Reply since the update my phone has continued crashing and rebooting automatically every 5 mins or so and it doesnt even restart its just the whole thing wherein the colorful circles go round and round this is post the google sign and before the android sign. Reset my phone to factory settings but the issue still persists. kindly advise on a solution to this. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website
Print   Email   Font Resize Local News Virtual reality field trips offer new way to explore By Callie Jones Journal-Advocate News editor Posted:   04/06/2017 09:33:16 PM MDT Fourth grade students in Kelsey Yearick's class at Caliche Elementary recently took a virtual reality field trip to the moon, with the help of Google Expeditions. Yearick raised enough money to purchase 30 Google Expeditions to be used across RE-1 Valley School District starting in the 2017-18 school year. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Students in Kelsey Yearick's fourth grade class at Caliche Elementary recently got to take a field trip to a place few students get to go: the moon. It was the first virtual field trip Yearick was able to take her students on after raising $9,000, enough money to purchase 30 Google Expeditions, which will be used by teachers throughout RE-1 Valley School District. The RE-1 Valley Foundation partnered with Yearick to raise the funds for the View-Master expedition kits, which give students a 360-degree view of almost anywhere — the Great Wall of China, coral reefs and other places in the ocean, national monuments, etc. Each kit includes a viewer device, with a cell phone inside that provides the images. The devices are locked into kiosk mode, so students can't view anything else. Kelsey Yearick, fourth grade teacher at Caliche Elementary, gives students directions on how to use the Google Expedition for a virtual reality field trip. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) In November, Yearick and Sarah Fritzler, executive director of the RE-1 Valley Foundation, presented a proposal to the school board to purchase the devices to be used by the whole district. They did not ask for any funds from the district; all funds for the project were raised by Yearick. By the end of January, with the help of the community, enough money had been raised for purchase 30 expedition kits. There were approximately 60 individuals and businesses that contributed to the project, with donations coming from as far away as Endwell, N.Y. Business contributors included: Bank of Colorado; Subway; KCI, D&D Feedlot; Supreme Ag Service; Johnson and Associates, CPAs, PC; Town Square Realty, Expert Electric, Cottage Creations, Robirds Electric, LLC (Jeff Robirds), Dinklage Feed Yard, First FarmBank, Sterling Livestock Commission Co., and Stewart Title. Advertisement "This small community continues to amaze me and I am forever grateful for it. We want our students to know that they have endless opportunities, and we hope they can see this by showing them the world," Yearick said in a Facebook post announcing she had reached her funding goal. "The community's support has been a true demonstration that we can achieve more when we come together," added the RE-1 Valley Foundation on its Facebook page. Images of the moon can be seen on a cell phone inside the Google Expeditions view device. The devices allow students to get a 360-degree view of various locations — the moon, the ocean, the Great Wall of China, national monuments and more. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) According to Yearick, who is the district coordinator for the Google Expeditions, they won't be rolled out districtwide until the 2017-18 school year, because there are still questions about how the four-day school week will look and how the expeditions will be able to travel from school to school in the mail. Right now, she is working on creating YouTube videos and online quizzes to train the teachers that want to use the devices. "I'm going to spend the rest of the year getting the training ready and getting comfortable with the kit, so I can be the best trainer possible," Yearick said. In order to get familiar with the expeditions, she will have her own class use them. Right now, the fourth graders are studying space, so she decided on a field trip to space and the moon for the students' first virtual field trip. "The best way to learn about a place is to go there. We know that it's really hard to be an astronaut, right? The best way to do that is through virtual reality right now," Yearick told the class. The students' excitement about the virtual field trip was evident from the moment they first put the expedition device on. "Woah, that's Earth!" "That's so cool!" "I can see the sun!" "Look over there!" were among the comments students could be heard exclaiming when they first put the devices on. During the virtual field trip, students got to see the Earth from space and the Milky Way, and then they landed on the moon, where they looked at craters and learned about the environment on the moon. They were also able to see images showing a timeline of the Space Race between the United States and Russian and got to see images of the aircraft used to explore the moon, including the Ranger, the Surveyor, the Lunokhod lunar rovers, Apollo 11 and Apollo 17. Lastly, the students got to explore a mock up of what the moon might look like if it were inhabited by humans. Yearick alternated between having students look in the Google Expeditions and fill out a question sheet about what they were looking at, so that students didn't get too overwhelmed by the virtual reality experience. Students were also allowed to look at the image on the cell phone if looking through the viewer device became too much. There are already approximately 236 pre-made Expeditions that teachers can choose from, but they can also make their own. For example, Yearick would like to create an Expedition for students to visit the different regions of Colorado, which is part of the fourth grade curriculum. The places RE-1 students will be able to explore with the Google Expeditions are truly endless.

We’ll continue to cover bots and messaging as part of our overall AI coverage, connecting the dots between all three topics while looking for new patterns. And wowza, just yesterday we saw the making of a new pattern. Google disclosed that its TPU chips (for tensor processing units) were 15 to 30 times faster than contemporary chips for AI computing. As Jordan Novet reports, Google relies on these custom TPU chips when operating artificial neural networks to more efficiently make inferences about new data. This is a significant development, one that augments the computational power of existing data centers (typically built on CPUs, or for AI-centric companies, additionally GPUs from the likes of AMD and Nvidia) to meet the future demands for neural networks. In 2013, Google had determined that AI workloads could double the computing demands of its data centers and began an effort to get 10 times better cost-performance in comparison with GPUs. The new chips are a result of this focus and have been in use since 2015. For AI and bots coverage, send news tips to Khari Johnson and guest post submissions to John Brandon.

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares133 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu have led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on-board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks.

Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams.

YouTube TV is official, includes 40+ networks for $35/month Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/02/28 1:55pm PDTFeb 28, 2017 175 Plus 1 on G+ 4478 Share on Facebook 138 Share on Twitter Total Shares4791 Applications Google News YouTube or Google offering traditional TV networks has been rumored for ages, and now it is finally official. Today Google unveiled 'YouTube TV,' a new subscription service offering dozens of TV networks, cloud DVR, and YouTube Red originals for just $35 a month. Obviously the library of TV networks will make or break YouTube TV, but Google is off to a pretty good start. YouTube TV includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, and dozens of other local sports and cable networks (see the below picture for all of them). Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus are available for an additional charge. Google's aim is to make watching TV more like watching YouTube, so one of the big selling points is Cloud DVR. Much like Xfinity and similar TV providers, recordings of shows are kept online for easy access. There is no storage limit or simultaneous recording limit, but recordings are deleted after nine months. There are a few additional benefits to YouTube TV worth mentioning. You can have up to six user accounts, with separate recommendations and DVRs, and up to three users can stream TV at once. The service also includes all YouTube Red Originals, and works on Android, iOS, and Chromecasts/Chromecast-compatible TVs. We've double checked with Google — YouTube TV does not include the ad-free YouTube Red subscription or Google Play Music membership, only YouTube Red Originals. As mentioned above, YouTube TV only costs $35 a month with no contract. Google says it will "be available soon in the largest U.S. markets and will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country." You can sign up at tv.youtube.com to find out when it becomes available in your area. Source: YouTube Blog Tags streaming youtube youtube tv subscribe ...

So you re in favor of socialism, due to all the success socialist countries have had over the centuries. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman The independent, third-party reviews most definitely found otherwise. Fox News has been consistently found to be the least factual mainstream news source, and its viewers the least well-informed. Waylon Walding Yes cause we all know if they say independent third party. They would never slip there bias in....Bahaha.. who was the independent third party people reviewing this? Lol F4LL0U7 Did somebody mistakenly tell you that if you laugh, the world will laugh with you? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman There have been many. Usually universities. But I'm not basing it purely off of them claiming to be independent. You look at the actual review methodology and results and see how it works out. Anyone who actually believes Fox News is more honest than anyone else is in way too deep. F4LL0U7 I get my fake news straight from Trump's Twitter feed tim242 Hahaha might as well go straight to the source! billy routh Thats because CNN told you that to cover for their own liberal bias F4LL0U7 I really don't need anyone to tell me that Trump spouts nothing but self-aggrandizement, hate-speech, and lies. It's pretty evident to anyone with more than two brain cells to rub together. Waylon Walding Or CNN which ever you look at first? Bahah F4LL0U7 Swing and a miss Midnitte Looks like it doesn't, the Arstechnica article includes some information that it doesn't include ad free from YouTube red so presumably it also doesn't include music. Lame for anyone with red. Artem Russakovskii Which it does not. tim242 That figures. They only threw in the worst part of YTR...the originals. morteum If I can watch NFL games I'm sold. i_say_uuhhh Me too. I currently have Ps Vue which I'm pretty happy with. The only gripe I have is the Horirble and laggy UI/UX across its platforms. Bruce Wayne PS4, PS3 and Fire TV have the best UI experience. Carson Saldanha Does it include YouTube Red and Play Music? Corbin Davenport It includes YouTube Red, there was no mention of Play Music so I assume not. Carson Saldanha Well doesn't YouTube Red include Play Music? So, I'd assume it'd be. Fadakar Yeah when you're paying $9.99. tim242 It doesn't include YouTube Red. It includes YouTube Red Originals, in the TV app. Jonathan Berry I think that is my conclusion as well, after reading it a few times. FourString It's more of the other way around--the Play Music service includes YouTube Red Jonathan Berry It's actually both ways. FourString Touché - longtime Play Music user here so I first saw the feature added from that end lol makapav No it's not. YouTube Red does not include Google Play Music. For e.g. activating YouTube Red on Google Home does not give you Play Music catalog. Jonathan Berry Yes, it does: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6308116?hl=en&ref_topic=6305525 Assuming you have both available. If you pay for one, you get both. tim242 It goes both ways. Jonathan Berry Hmm, or does it? It includes YouTube Red *Originals* in the "new YouTube TV app." So maybe YT Red subscription (no commercials on YouTube) is still separate. :-/ tim242 YouTube Red Originals They did not say if the rest of Red is included. theProffer Corbin, if we have YTR, will it apply over at YT-TV? I imagine it won't because television networks, but I'm just curious. create812 It includes Red, but no mention of Play Music yet. I'd imagine Music will stay separate. tim242 Music and Red are currently together. But it says Red Originals are included in TV...it did not state whether the rest is included. Artem Russakovskii It does not include Red, just Originals. John Bush If they gave subscribers YouTube TV, YouTube Red, and Play Music all for $35 a month for six users, that would be one hell of a deal. Sign me up!! Artem Russakovskii No. Skeptic Spartan It does not include RED or Music. Cakefish Still no Youtube Red for the UK... >_< tim242 Well at least you have adblockers over there : ) Sachin Bahal Or Canada Mix Once this package hits Canada it will have 14 less channels and cost $60, lol. Sachin Bahal YouTube TV probably won't ever come to Canada because Rogers and Bell basically own the rights to everything TV-related but I still don't understand why they haven't launched YouTube Red in Canada yet, I mean we already have the Google Play Music subscription here. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I use a VPN. =[ Captain_Invisible But you need a US credit card too. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Didn't matter in my case. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Worked fine with mine. Captain_Invisible Without a US credit card? Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Banco de Chile" as Bank of Chile. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes Dan Cross Yeah, but don't we get 10% off films and music on Google Play instead of ad-free YouTube? I know what I'd rather have. Richard Branches Or latin-america... xenotrumpet @XDA How would this compare to something like, say, Dish Network or DirecTV? Maha Rashtrian Cost wise, it is cheaper. Service wise, they are completely different models all-together. AbbyZFresh Direct TV has over 100 channels. tim242 And their quality of streams suck. OligarchyAmbulance And their quality of apps sucks worse. UberCrew I have used the FireTV & Apple TV apps and they both work fine. UberCrew Quality of the streams work perfectly fine for me. tim242 You must be using some kind of magic. Everybody has complained about it, and AT&T even admitted how horrible it has been. UberCrew No I just have a proper setup with everything hard wired. Also my ISP location may have a better route to AT&T servers. Either way the streaming has worked fine for me. So your "Everybody has complained" claim is false. I am sure their has been issues for many people in different areas. Some are due to AT&T's network issues but I have no doubt that many of the complaints are due to people having bad home network setups or poor internet service. destinyhud direct tv is a mess at the moment. not sure about sling UberCrew How is DirecTV a mess? Did you mean DirecTV satellite service or DirecTV Now the streaming service? DirecTV Now the streaming service works perfectly fine for me as far as streaming goes. It just lacks basic features such as DVR, has a limited On-demand library, lacks support for many TV Everywhere apps and does not have an Android TV app. Problem is each of these OTT services is flawed in one way or another. Either they are lacking content, features or both. destinyhud just one of the few rants i have seen online and I have the same issues as well http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14257936/directv-now-errors-complaints-att I was not alone TechGuy22 until they allow people to choose which channel they want or not why the fuck would i need fox news for ? i'll stick to Kodi. TechGuy22 also no cartoon network too expensive A Person Hates Fox and watches cartoons. Checks out. TechGuy22 well i'm not 60. lomsha Nothing wrong with that. grizzlyjon83 Meh. No Viacom channels (not a shock), no Turner channels. Not seeing anything that would pull me away from Sling TV currently. Box Also no Scripps (HGTV, Food, etc) or Discovery channels. Looks like they spent all of their money on sports. TechGuy22 news channel and other crappy channels as well. wtf. Bruce Wayne Money well spent. Most of the Scripps channels are fake reality nonsense. Adam Jones I'm on Sling too. If their lineup catches up.. damn son. I like Sling but I'm not in a local ABC market and don't want to put up an antenna. MJ Agreed, the $25 SlingTV package has a better lineup for me but I would like the cloud DVR. Yaki Forto http://blog.sling.com/announcements/important-update-sling-tv-cloud-dvr-beta-program/ MJ I know someday SlingTV will have cloud DVR but I was talking about NOW. create812 Cloud DVR? I'd they're just recording/saving everything once and serving it back to those who "DVR" it. Much more efficient than every individual recording to their own copies to their own devices! Bruce Wayne It's Google. They have server farms all over the place. Recording a couple of shows is nothing to them. dizel123 Does it matter? Nathan Haines It does not. Nick Felker I imagine they're doing something like that. Each show will probably be a YouTube video under the hood, like they're already doing with Google Play Movies & TV. They'll just give you the correct permissions to view it. UberCrew As long as they don't remove the ability to fast-forward passed commercials. Biggest negative to On-demand content is the inability to skip over most advertisements. PaulW US only I assume?? 😆😄 Time to move to a better country ;) Hunter Hubers Really want to know if this includes Google Play Music. tim242 That's what we all are wondering : ) JSo I doubt it. It just says it includes all YouTube Red Originals. Probably doesn't mean you get the ad free youtube and all the other things as well unless you're paying the $9.99 a month. Which then includes Google Music. makapav It does not include YouTube Red or Play Music. You guys are deluding yourselves in the expectation. It is very clear that this includes YouTube Red Originals. Browningate Deezloader>Google Music, so it's of no concern anymore. Artem Russakovskii It does not. It's pretty clear from the post, but since I was only about 99% sure, I reached out to Google, and now I'm 100% sure. Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I guess anyone except anyone who lives in the US is a second class user AGAIN. Navarr Barnier It's not even going to be available to all of the US. Television licensing is *super hard* legal stuff Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know I know... Only that is frustrating. Licensing for Netflix was hard, TV channels should be harder. Luckily, Cumulus TV works fine. vwbeetlvr Where is AMC? Zach Mauch No Walking Dead for you! Bob How is that series still on... Lost me with 2 seasons spent at the prison. Talk about fluff... Miguel Angel I don't blame you for stopping in the worst season. But give season 3 and beyond a chance. I don't think you'll regret it. Zahir_SMASH I couldn't even get past season 2 Suicide_Note Your loss. Negan is a total badass. Kevin Glassman I am Negan, No, seriously, when did that mullet Eugene become a badass, bedpan stealing SOB... making molten metal covered walkers... bonus points for head armor. Suicide_Note It's all about survival. He has to depend on himself now, and not others. He may be a coward, but Eugene is no dummy. abc Probably because TV channels don't air programs based on your personal preferences. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ On PlayStation Vue John Doe Yeah it's missing Viacom channels as well so I guess Google is negotiating with them. I hate TV networks. They should do what Netflix did and negotiate with Studios. People don't care about live TV anymore except for the News, sporting events and other big events like New years eve and award shows. People care about shows and the actual content not the networks they just bundle shit you don't want to watch and shove it down your throat. AbbyZFresh Disgusting. These channels are barebones and they have the audacity to charge $35 for this? I'll stick with PS Vue. tlogank Disgusting? That's a weird adjective to describe the options. This looks better for me personally, especially giving 6 accounts access. All competition is a good thing, regardless. Zach Mauch Having both ESPN and Fox Sports is the reason for the higher price I would assume. I don't know about PS Vue, but I think the Sling price for both of those is either $30 or $35. Bruce Wayne Vue has ESPN, ESPN 2, FS1 and FS2 in their $30 package. 😆😄 Side by Side comparison to PS Vue? YTTV looks better to me. Steve Jones To each their own but to me Vue is way better. This seems bare bones for 35 bucks. UberCrew For me I would rate these OTT services going just by channel lineup like this. 1: DirecTv Now 2. PS Vue. 3.Sling TV 4. Youtube TV. designdolphin I may have missed it, but any word about whether there will be commercials? tlogank of course, this is regular live tv designdolphin Thanks. So then would the networks like NBC, ABC, CBS, etc. be the local broadcast versions? Rerun Stubbs yes..that is why it is only available in select markets at first. WEll..not totally local. They are likely never going to make deals with LOCAL local networks if you live in a small city that has its own TV. Then you will likely be stuck with the nearest major cities channels. Bruce Wayne It's live TV.... Chris Oh Um...OTA channels for free, Plex DVR? Why am I paying $35 a month? Are we slowly heading back to "cable"? without the cable? zepy3 Not all of us get OTA channels. thespacecowboy Only core channels are usually available OTA. Most others are only via cable, satellite, or streaming Chris Oh still thinks this is too much... Lateef Alabi-Oki Google, let me help you out. - Include ad-free YouTube Red support. - Include Google Play Music Family plan support. - Include Google Assistant/Google Home/Google Cast/Android TV support out of the box. You now have the best live streaming platform on the planet. No competition whatsoever. 😆😄 $35 + $14.99 GPM/YTR (Family-6 users) = $49.99/month destinyhud lol exactly what i was thinking. Dan Lynch Math is hard. Lateef Alabi-Oki Gaddamnit! I didn't even bother doing the calculation in my head. I still don't want to pay for 2 different Google streaming services. fahadayaz Considering that it works out to be less than how much you were willing to pay, why not? 🤔 Lateef Alabi-Oki It doesn't work out to be less if you include taxes. I pay around $16 and some change for YouTube Red and GPM Family. If this package included YouTube Red and GPM family, it'll be a good deal. fahadayaz Ah yeah - good point. I forgot that in the US, the price they advertise isn't necessarily the price that you pay. :/ moosc So you can watch on your mobile device? Corbin Davenport Yep. OligarchyAmbulance Wow, no HGTV? That's one of the few networks *every* streaming service gets. I'm amazed they managed to get live local networks though, Vue is the only other to manage that and it's only for CBS. I may finally switch from Vue for this. Steve Jones That channel lineup is garbage. No TBS, AMC, TNT, Discovery, and more. As a cord cutter the broadcast networks being included is meaningless since I can get those OTA and in HD for free without them using up my data. PSVue seems like a better deal right now. Kevin Glassman with Rick and Morty Season 3 dropping anytime now, you would think they would of tried to get CN, well fanboys will be fanboys, I'm keeping my PS Vue for 35$/month Waylon Walding Not sure how you get all those ESPN channels via rabbit ears? SavageJeep @StevieJones39:disqus Still waiting to DVR over the local channels too! Steve Jones I get those over Vue. The antenna is for the local networks. Lee Interesting but you better make sure you don't blow up your monthly data allowance. I think this route is better because you can select what you want to watch when you want to watch it. We tried Layer3TV over the holidays and it somewhat blew up our data usage. Bruce Wayne PlayStation Vue is still better. You can have up to five users plus you get more channels for the base price of $30. stetsonaw How so, aside from channel lineups? I'm all for the 9 month DVR. Likely a much better mobile experience as well. Bruce Wayne Channel lineup is important. They don't have a lot of the channels I watch but Vue does. Like I said, it's also cheaper and has more simultaneous streams available. Until it debuts, we have no idea what the mobile experience is like so that can't be talked about. I will admit that the nine month DVR is nice as opposed to just one month on Vue. stetsonaw Channel lineup is big for me as well, and until it expands to add everything I want, I'll stick with Vue. I do like that the locals don't add an extra $10 to the bill. And I'm figuring the mobile experience will be better since it will be made by google, and not be as clunky as the Vue app. Bruce Wayne Indeed. This is a start in the right direction. If they can make it as ubiquitous as YouTube, that would be a great thing. Rerun Stubbs How so aside from channel lineups? Well...for a TELEVISION package...lineups are pretty much the MOST IMPORTANT thing for 99.9999999999% of people. 9 months of DVR service doesn't mean a damn thing if it doesn't include the channel you want. UberCrew No $30 PS Vue package here. Youtube TV's channel lineup does suck though. Tom Z Problem is the need for a fast internet connection at home. I tried to watch a movie on Google Movies and it kept buffering. The picture and sound also didn't even come close to DirecTV that I currently have. destinyhud i have never had buffering on play movies. it takes a few seconds extra to start the video but besides that it stream fine. I think its probably your router/provider issue RyRyTheFunBun Sooo, are we gonna get a native YouTube app for Fire TV now? Duder12 Buy an Android TV like the Shield RyRyTheFunBun No stetsonaw Really wish MLB Network would make deals with other streaming services. DirecTV Now is the only option, and no thanks. Hopefully that and AMC get added at some point. Heck, just AMC would probably encourage me to move away from Vue. Dimitri Google has just announced that it will be shutting YouTube TV down after just 23 minutes as part of its Spring Cleaning initiative. All Data will be moved till Google Drive until April 28. Bruce Wayne Lmfao. makapav ...at that point, Google Drive will shut down. theProffer Though, to be serious for a moment, it might be dead soon(TM). Seeing as how net neutrality is probably going to die in this political cycle, and metered WIRED internet connections become common place, expect the real cost of ditching cable providers to be a lot more than $35+internet/month. Donald King I'll keep PlayStation Vue. I get AMC and more channels period for same price Bruce Wayne You mean AMC? XerBlade Well, there are already channels in that infographic that are offered by literally none of the existing streaming TV providers. I'd say they're off to a good start. Bruce Wayne Like? Jay Not the channels I want or need to pull me away from Vue. Damn. It'd have to at the very least match my current channel selection. Willie D They could make it cheaper by ditching ESPN and Disney for those of us who not only don't care for sports, but don't have children. That alone would drop the price by $10 or more, based on other subscription program plans I've seen that trade off channels for these two. Less cost for 10 more channels, or more cost for ESPN and Disney and omitting the other channels is the trade. I'll take more for less please. Also I hope they move all the Red channels to this platform and off the normal platform, I hate all the content, its arrogant, pretentious, and quite honestly, I can only see so many washed up YouTube stars like Joey Graceffa's face clog up my "suggestions" so many times before I wanna cancel totally. tim242 The biggest flaw...too much emphasis on sports. Give us a package without sports, so that we get a better price. Corbin Davenport I would definitely be interested in a non-sports package. billy I understand the lack of interest in sports, but this does provide some added value to sports fans that other services don't. The fact that this potentially includes my local cable sports network (Comcast Sports Net) is a pretty big selling point. None of the other streaming services allow me to watch the local games, only national broadcasts. Bruce Wayne Sports are a big seller and it's the main reason people still stick with live TV. Everything else can be watched on-demand. Sports is generally watched and enjoyed live. tim242 I get that. But offering a non-sports package for much less money would get even more customers. Bruce Wayne Indeed. I'm sure they will roll out additional packages and services as time goes on. duke69111 I disagree. The one thing that kept me from dropping my cable was live sports. This package contains them all with the exception of Turner Networks for March Madness. tim242 You disagree because you like sports. You also like your sports to be subsidized by those of us that don't care for sports. Rerun Stubbs Tim..it is a good thing you have given up trying to lose your virginity. Otherwise, Darwinism would have weeded you out of the gene pool a long time ago. Because even a FIFTH grader would see that your comment is not just hilariously ignorant, but 100% BACKWARDS. Try to use your brain for the first time in your life. Your channel has FAR fewer viewers. The sports channels have LOTS more! So...it is very obvious that it is the sports channels that are subsidizing the virginal crap you watch. IT is just plain common sense. If it was just your channel, they would have to make do with just the subscriber money for like 2 million subscribers. But thanks to everybody that wants ESPN but not your crap, they get to force 560 million people to pay them. In other words, without ESPN, your channel would have to charge 25 times as much per subscriber. So it is time YOU stop sponging off sports fans, you suicidally lonely, self cutting welfare failure. I mean...it is just plain common sense that subsidies happen FROM the more popular to the less popular. tim242 Blocked. Bye. UberCrew The same ESPN that is losing millions, hemorrhaging subscribers and had to fire a bunch of employees. ESPN doesn't even show many games anymore. Most the time it's just a bunch of talking heads who have turned the network into another reality TV crap fest. If you want to watch real sports I wouldn't bother with a has been network like ESPN. SB one down, three across.. did a double take. Steve Freeman What, Free Form? What is it? stetsonaw ABC Family's new name, they rebranded it last year. Steve Freeman Gotcha. I had no idea, thx. Nate Awesome and Google didn't even add CNN they smart we got no room for that very fake news here, even though Google is a bunch of liberals cucks anyway Patrick Smithopolis It's odd they include the channel that started the fake news trend - FOX. Marty Google may be a bunch of liberals, but they are the more rational variety... freshprince_87 That doesn't even make any sense Marty I know. But it's Google...lol tim242 Shut up. Stop making everything political. Go to Breitbart. Patrick Smithopolis And they're not even original. They just parrot what Trump says. They're mindless zombies. Marty Breitbart? Meh, too liberal. Rerun Stubbs Oooh! You sure made Fox News look bad! And you looked SO intelligent! Doby Gillis Oh look the deplorable racists and commie lovers are jizzing in their pants. Marty You got that wrong. You liberals are the commie lovers and racists. You even say it on national news how "white people are what's wrong with America" and white people should not be in charge of the Democratic Party. You liberals are so violent and intolerant that you riot at UC Berekely over a conservative scheduled to talk there. You liberals are against freedom of speech and destroy property, commit violent acts against anyone who disagrees with you. Yeah, you have that wrong. You liberals are the real racists, bigots and commies. You're also fascists. But don't take my word, the airwaves are full of videos showing what you all do. Those videos are forever... tim242 Milo is not a conservative haha. You people are silly. JoeKerr Wonder if they are going to support AndroidTV. The only reason I have Sling is for AMC. destinyhud yes. chromecast is supported and ATV has chromecast built in dizel123 I think he means will it have a dedicated Android TV app. UberCrew No google cast is not the same as a native Android TV app. I don't like using google cast and would rather have an Android TV app. Lazy Tango Lack of AMC and Adult Swim/Cartoon Network is kind of a dealbreaker for me. I'll stick with Sling. Ramon Oh damn. Shit just got real. Marty Heh...not one channel there do I watch. I guess that's why I'm not a braindead liberal out rioting and destroying my friends' property. I haven't been brainwashed or programmed by those channels. MatchstickMan Eh, 2/10 troll attempt... dizel123 You give far too much credit Marty Lol..just 2/10?? tim242 Fox News is on there...troll. Marty Meh...FN is too liberal..lol tim242 The fact that the terms liberal and conservative are being brought up here, means that you need to get some fresh air and separate yourself from cable news for a while. Marty Joke. It was a joke. 😋 tim242 I'm really glad to hear that! I was thinking that you were one of the good guys around here. Marty Sometimes my dry humor rubs the wrong way. 😉 Valery Babanin 8:00 https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f8ddd957979b663d58e03ae5b6197a816041ab389837200e7fca3454453fdcfc.png tim242 What does that mean? destinyhud it means its 8 o clock tim242 I get that. But why does that bear pointing out? destinyhud i was trying to be sarcastic. it could be a reference to Android 8.0 turbooo Typically Google uses that to indicate which Android version the phone in the picture is using. For example 7.1 would read 7:10. tim242 Ahhh. That makes sense. Valery Babanin New Android version Francois Roy Yet another service that will never make it outside the US of A. Fuck Google. If Apple ever attempts something similar, they'll launch in 100 countries on day 1. Doby Gillis Go suck Jobs' dead dick some more. Francois Roy You are a clever man. Mommy's gotta be so proud of you! tim242 You must not understand TV. stetsonaw You do realize that these are US channels, which are typically only shown in the US? I know there are some providers in other countries that work out international deals, but how would you expect something like this (or vue, or sling, or DirecTV Now or...) to be functional in any fashion outside of the US? Francois Roy You do are aware that TV is also a thing outside the US, right?.. Well, believe it or not, we even have our own channels! stetsonaw You are missing my point. If Google is to offer something like this outside the US, it would require licensing with channels available in the country where the service is being offered. Francois Roy Indeed, it would. MY point is that it's exactly what Apple would do. They would never launch a new service in a single country. Rerun Stubbs Apple is not going to DO something like this, idiot. There is a HUGE difference between offering an overpriced product worldwide and making deals with TV networks. Surely even a worthless Frenchman realizes that. Francois Roy Hey pal; 1- I'm Canadian 2- Go fuck yourself Chester Roberts *Cough Cough* Time reads 8:00 on the screenshot on the website... tv.youtube.com/welcome Sexecutive Officer How about Canada though? Francois Roy Google doesn't give a shit about what happens outside USA MatchstickMan Wooo! U!S!A! U!S!A! U!S!A! freshprince_87 I hope this gets cartoon network and boomerang.... Bruce Wayne Boomerang is usually an upper tier channel. Mike O When is Google gonna stop shoving down our throats with that "YouTube Red Originals" nonsense? It's not a perk and no one wants it. Stop adding it to deals. stetsonaw Are ANY of them worth watching? destinyhud mind field is worth watch.. thats one of the few i like. my wife like single by 30. thats pretty much it yann933 Yeah, Mind Field is definitely a good one, gotta love Michael Stevens 👍👌 tlogank not everyone has the same opinion as you, isn't that crazy? Mike O They should. LOL Rerun Stubbs Yeah...but the number of people who bother with it shows that FAR more people have his opinion than yours. It is a failure about on the level of Google+ Glich no food, no cartoon network/adult swim no bbc.. too bad perhaps more will be added later. Vivek Rameses I'm sure they'll come out with a kids package soon. Alex Rusinov No AMC no deal. I need to get my "Walking Dead" fix :) Oliver Ulpts Including Trump propaganda network Fox News Rerun Stubbs Oooh! You sure showed President Trump! Gilberto Aren't half of these channels already free? Gabriel Macys Got enough FOX channels, Google? Are you basing channel selection on the average Youtube commenter? kamiller42 Get over it. Rerun Stubbs Ummm...you DO realize that the Fox channels are the highest rated ones on TV, right? Or did you wave bye bye to reality once you realized that you would never have a life worth living? remi why would you have to wait when it's available in your area? doesn't it work with a dedicated youtube tv app and your mobile or wifi connection? lomsha Maybe because of local channels. tlogank locals iG @fonerin5 Oh god. Kodi will get so much better now.. 🗣🙌🏾👏🏾 Bruce Wayne It would be nice if they got Nick and Nicktoons. Anthony If this was $40 and included Google Music I would be all over this. YouTube Red is beyond worthless to me. tim242 This does not include YouTube Red...only its originals in the TV app. ScottColbert I'll take DirectNow over this, better selection, more channels for the same price. Vivek Rameses Wow, this is going to fail miserably. This makes sling TV look good. b00sted Need AMC and history channel David Nowicki Will it have Comcast sports to watch my Blackhawks win the cup and Cubs repeat. saltynegro As someone who still has YouTube Red and Google Music as a package deal for 9.99, I wonder if getting this will separate the services for my account. That would be unfortunate. :( tim242 YouTube Red is not included in this TV package. They are only including the YouTube Red originals in the TV app. lomsha Missing a lot for now. Ryuuie If Cartoon Network and Nick show up, I'm fuckin' down. Nathan Gonzalez ...Internet rates are going to skyrocket... fahadayaz Well they shouldn't advertise unlimited if they're aren't able to provide such a service. Paul Hansen Comcast and ATT don't advertise unlimited any more in many markets. Limited to 1tb/mo José Gómez The channel listing is pretty compelling. If they add a few more Spanish sports channels such as Deportes Univision, ESPN Deportes, and BEIN ñ (the only sport I care about is soccer) as well as AMC I'll strongly consider it. If they include Play Music, which I already subscribe to, it's almost a no brainer but I need my La Liga, Liga MX and Walking Dead. Hopefully they'll add those channels soon. CDisqusman Chiller - cool! but, no Spongebob or Southpark? Josh Crumley This has huuuuuuge potential. The main thing I hate about the existing online-tv services like sling and ps vue and such is that their native apps usually suck or lag, the interfaces are clunky, and "not everything works just right". Using YouTube as a backbone makes this sound like it will be flawless and stable right out of the box. Now just fix that lineup a bit and include Red/GPM and I'm in. Total Insecurity I am looking forward to Google TV in 2025 in Germany! /s Matthai Meanwhile, in Australia Foxtel: hahahahahaha no. Not permitted here. Ever. Mirad77 Is that 40+ network or channels? Some networks have more than one channels. $35 will be expensive for only 40 channels. PS Vue would be better for the my dollar. nxtiak No Cartoon Network, meh. spearstuff Yeah I need Cartoon Network. That is the main channel I watch. thomasguide2 This is a really lame channel lineup, sling + an antenna will get you a better lineup for less money. Honestly I don't care for local channels they're good for checking weather and sports on local new and not much else. mkc23 Does it include fake news? I need those for doing my thinking for me josh rosales No Turner networks for NCAA March madness. Pass. Browningate It seems like all of these streaming services are always missing a handful of essential channels. I guess it's not time to dump the cable subscription just yet. UberCrew Exactly. PS Vue has great features but is missing too many channels and their pricing is too high here, DirecTV Now has the best channel lineup of all these services but is still missing some plus it is missing important features. Sling TV has a decent channel selection but to get the ones we want we have to keep adding additional packages. At that point the pricing just gets to the point of being similar to traditional cable TV. Youtube TV has very few channels that we care about. At this point none of these services is complete at least as far as the needs of our household go. They just aren't mature enough for us to leave Comcast for any of them yet. Browningate True. Between Vue, SlingTV, and YouTubeTV, most of the channels one could want are available, but it would require the purchase of three expensive subscriptions to have them all, defeating the purpose. They're getting better, but it's just a reminder that these services still aren't ready to replace your cable subscription yet. Rerun Stubbs Have you all not figured out WHY? IT is because a good portion of your cable package is NOT going to the cable company. Over the last 10 years or so, every time a channel has had their contract end, they have demanded HUGE rate increases per subscriber. So obviously, if any streaming service was going to get a comparable package, they would have to charge a comparable amount. Think about it...say there are about 100 million cable/satellite subscribers. A channel that only has maybe 2 million viewers in any given month can charge just 20 cents a month and still get $20 million! Just from subscriber fees. Because all the other subscribers to cable have to pay whether they want to or not. (This is also why idiots who think that the smaller channels are subsidizing ESPN are literally ass backward on reality. It is ESPN fans that are subsidizing the smaller networks.) So now say you have a situation where sorts fans DIDN'T have to subsidize the crappy obscure channel. Now, they would only get 2 million willing to pay for it. But...they still want their $20 million a month to pay for the programming. So now they have to charge $10 a month instead of 20 cents! Which, of course, will make a significant portion of their 2 million fans not subscribe, and they STILL come out behind. The first streaming channel that make deals with LOCAL sports channels, like MSG, YES and SNY in the NY area will win the day. I am a sports fan and I have NO IDEA where ESPN is on my cable lineup. Because like most spots fans, I have absolutely NO desire to sit down and watch some random sporting event between two teams that I don't care about. If the San Diego Padres are playing the Milwaukee Brewers, I am not watching it. UberCrew I know that for most sports fans they couldn't care less about ESPN. I agree most people want to watch their favorite teams so they will want the local networks and local sports channels . For someone like me who is an NFL fan of a non local team and don't care too much about the other sports the local sports networks don't appeal to me. My only option is NFL Sunday ticket or finding a stream somewhere. Not much choice at all. None of the current OTT streaming services can offer everything that I want. Nahuel Any news about this services outside U.S? South america especially? JohnD That list sucks. Fox news but no CNN lol tim242 They don't handpick channels. They have to get partnerships. Give it time. Rerun Stubbs Uhhh..one has LOTS of viewers. The other one has very few. So that choice was obvious if they want to attract more customers. Paco Inurreta Now they need to do it for a day or for a channel. I'd love to watch the SuperBowl, F1 races or any major sport event (if they are going to be in the sport channels above) and watch them legally without using a streaming service. xunknownx is this live TV? so i can watch live sports and stuff? or is it just on demand stuff? dirtmound Without BEIN Sports or a BEIN Sports connect account, I still prefer Fubo.tv EE-EHN No Food Network no buy Anjo Cerdeña Noteworthy: the landing page comes with a new seemingly YouTube-branded typeface: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7e26752687b5565ab9064c07fd3fd4b59700ebed7eb5c85af1bae25ee7230e3f.png adam seymour But does it include you tube red /s Nathan Budd We still don't have YouTube Red or Podcasts in Google Play Music over here in the UK, so I'm not going to hold my breath. In the mean time, I've cancelled my Family play music subscription, and am now using Spotify and Amazon Prime TV. Google needs to get its act together with international releases! JG I would like to see the YouTube Red Originals channel expanded to be more aligned with Netflix and Hulu's Originals. I'm sure Google would have enough money to do a Stranger Things or Man In The High Castle must watch series... Or maybe resurrect/reboot some series... Maybe Firefly for example (though Tudyk has Powerless now and Glass unfortunately is no longer with us) bekifft This seems to be mostly sports channels. Also, when was the last time Google had to release a *web based* feature on a *city by city* basis? I can't wait for these dinosaurs to die. Sir_Brizz It's because they are providing local broadcast stations. Bryan Pizzuti Not a bad start, their local network coverage is impressive, they got all 5 major networks (assuming you consider CW to be "major."). Missing a lot of cable channels though. NFL network, the Scripps channels (and obviously Viacom). Looks like Turner opted out too, no TNT, no CNN. Toys Samurai CW is major, to me. Just when I was about to celebrate that finally a streaming service with CW is available, I found that CNN is missing. Those twos are my brain food. dirtyjudo The CW has it's own app. The shows are free. Sir_Brizz Just watch Fox then. Rerun Stubbs your brain must be pretty skinny. Rerun Stubbs God for no NFL network. They show like EIGHT games a year and the rest of filler. Any game that features a local team must be carried by a local station so it is literally just providing games against teams that most people don't care to watch. And they want over $30 a year per subscriber. You really want to pay $4 to watch a regular season game between the Chargers and Seahawks? JRomeo hmmmm $8 per month for Hulu, or $35 per month for this new tv thing. I think Hulu Wins. Reginald Pierre nah 35$ for directv now with 100+ channels is the real win at the moment. Hulu is truly limited, recently cancelled service. Hoping Google will beef up channel count on this service down the line. Biga173rd 35$ a month GTFOH. Kimmy Gibbler No cartoon network. No deal Timothy Vreeland PlayStation Vue needs to rebrand itself. It blows all of the other competition out of the water, and it works smoothly. I would think having PlayStation in its name is holding it back from people who aren't gamers. I've seen some people think you need a PlayStation, or think it's an add on service for PlayStation Network. Sir_Brizz I would get this with the unlimited DVR and local broadcast stations it is a better deal than anyone else has right now. Hopefully it will come to my area fast (I'm the original Sling.tv area...). Eddy Nelson Lopez I can watch every single one of those channels for free with Kodi 😂😂 Cat Astrophy Weak selection and no bundle with Music and Red. Not for $35 no. Hulu ad-free sub and Netflix COMBINED are cheaper. JG Google says it will "be available soon in the largest U.S. markets and will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country." Do we know how they're defining "soon"? It apparently isn't yet available in San Diego (8th largest city in the US)... I wonder if Google were to drop the local stations [of course that would mean loosing the already ultra small possibility I'd get to see Star Trek Discovery on it totally] and just included the national stations (USA, SyFy, et al) if they could possibly do a nation wide launch. Awhile ago I read an article about Google working on a system to personalize TV ads. Google could use that to inject their own ads, personalized to me. Targeted ads would more likely be more effective in getting me to buy something. And removing all of the localized content could potentially allow Google to get past the whole "you can't show content from out of the area" rule. My phone's GPS would be able to let their system know which time zone I'm in so I can't start watching prime time shows from an East Coast feed at 5pm on the West Coast... Rupam Chakma http://www.TricksFoorti.com UberCrew I have no interest in Youtube TV at $35/mo with that listed channel lineup. It only includes about 6 out of the 20 or so channels that we normally watch. Problem is none of the other OTT services offers all of the programming that we watch either. DirecTV Now comes the closest but their lack of DVR service, which is a must since most On-Demand content contains advertisements that you can't fast-forward over, makes it a non-starter for us. Plus some content is not available On-Demand or it's availability is delayed significantly . Speaking of On-Demand, DirecTV Now's current library is rather sparse while their support for TV Everywhere app logins is also extremely lacking. DirecTV Now still doesn't even offer a native app for Android TV or a Roku channel. So it's either continue to pay Comcast or subscribe to more than one of these OTT services to get most of the content/features that we want. In the end the pricing is not much different and we still end up paying more than we would like.

I only want maybe 5 channels. This is no different than cable packages that force you to pay for channels we don't want. I'll skip this until they offer A-la-cart. Actually, I no longer select channels, rather, I select the shows I want to watch, regardless of channel. Fortunately there are online alternatives that allow me to select what I want to watch and don't force me into the old outdated cable box all or nothing formula. Rerun Stubbs Use your brain for a second. With 100 million subscribers for cable and satellite, a small cable netowrk (and usually the whiners like you are always fans of crap that no one else watches) can charge maybe 50 cents per subscriber and still make SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS a year off just subscriber fees. Even i htey only get like 1.5 million viewers EVERY MONTH. So literally, only 1.5 million POTENTIAL customers at any price. Now. you go to your ala carte and you know that 100 million down to the 1.5 million. But..that channel still wants their $50 million a month. They use that to PRODUCE THE PROGRAMMING, after all. (Along with commercials.) So..would you be willing to pay more than $33 for that ONE channel? Because that is what you would have to do. Even if all 1.5 million people that watch when it costs just 50 cents were willing to pay full price, it would be $33 a month. But in reality, no one would pay that much so they would go out of business. Rerun Stubbs Silly blogs still don't get it. No..this does NOT offer "local sports". Crap like the SEC network does not matter to most people. And until a streaming service makes deals with TRULY local sports channels, it is not an option for sports fans. 99% of sports fans...even football fans don't just mindlessly sit there and watch games between teams they don't care about. They follow specific teams...usually the one closest to where they live. So...until NYers can get MSG, SNY and YES, this is not option for them. Same with all the other regional sports that cover the nearest MLB, NHL, and NBA team. The first streaming site that pounds the pavement and works out deals with regional sports channel will win the day. And only then can the term "cable killer" be used. YouTube TV will be yet another in a long list of projects Google tries for about a year and then forgets about for another 2 years before killing it.

The latest was a major December update aimed at improving the game. There’s plenty to love about the latest changes, but it’s also causing problems for some. Here we’ll explain how to fix the “Device is not compatible” error while trying to update Clash of Clans on Android. Additionally, we have more details about Google accounts not syncing correctly for saved villages. It’s one of the most popular titles on Android and iOS. Millions of people play it daily. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this error message, but recently it has been happening more frequently. Most other issues can be fixed with the instructions below. Read: Clash of Clans Updates: 7 Things We Want Next The last update added tons of level 11 troops, cheaper costs and other things. However, it also added some problems. In fact, some can’t update the game at all. As a result it can’t be played. This is a big issue, and hopefully the few suggestions below can help. If you haven’t updated you’ll see a notification upon launching the game that an update is available. You cannot play until you accept this, go to the Google Play Store, and update to the latest version of the game. Everything is fine for those on iOS, but Android users are being met with a very odd problem. Users are getting an error on the Google Play Store for Clash of Clans that says, “Device is not compatible with this version” and are unable to update. Supercell confirmed this is a problem, and has offered up a fix for those having issues. Players affected by "Your device is not compatible with this version", please try: Settings >App Manager>Google Play Store>Clear data/cache — Clash of Clans (@ClashofClans) January 26, 2016 If you can’t update, you can’t play. Some are even in an active Clan War and can’t update in order to fight before time runs out. Which as many can imagine, would be very frustrating. Update: On February 26th Supercell made some changes and had another small maintenance break to fix the device incompatible and other Google services issues. Let us know in the comments below if the problem is still going on. Update #2: On March 4th Supercell finally fixed the Google Play Store device not compatible Clash of Clans problem, as well as the Google Games ID and sync issue many users have been experiencing. According to them, those who were unable to sync their Google Games account to restore or save a village, and the thousands of users who couldn’t update, should all be able to download the latest update from the Google Play Store release late last night and this morning. Head into the Play Store, check for updates, and download it right now to get back to Clashing. Update #3: The new December Clash of Clans update made this issue appear again. Users have also experienced crashes while in global chat, chat logs being out of order and other small things. Supercell may release another optional update to fix this. Even people that have been using the same device for well over a year are having issues. We’re seeing reports all over Twitter that people with tablets, the LG G3, Galaxy S6 and other devices are all experiencing this error. I’ve updated a Galaxy S7, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet and Nexus 9 all without any problems. So we’re not sure what is causing this at the moment, or what Android devices are experiencing it. been playing #COC on the same phone for 3 months and today its telling me that my device is not compatible with this version @ClashofClans — EllisWard✌️ (@fan_paige_wwe) January 26, 2016 If you are trying to update Clash of Clans on an Android device but running into problems, there are a few potential fixes. There is either something messed up with the Google Play Store, or something Supercell did. They’re blaming it on the Google Play, and suggest users clear the Store cache or data to resolve it. Above are basic instructions, but below are screenshots to help those experiencing issues. Instructions To fix the Clash of Clans update “your device is not compatible with this version” error message, try clearing the Google Play Store cache, and then data. Next, restart the Google Play Store and accept the update again. Pull down the notification bar on your Android device and hit the gear-shaped settings icon, or find “settings” in the application tray. From here navigate to Apps, or App Manager. Next scroll down and find Google Play Store. Select this, and tap “Clear Cache or Data” as shown below. This should erase everything, and get rid of any corrupt files that seem to be causing this problem. Supercell claims this will fix the error. Multiple comments suggest it worked. Now go back and download the update. Other Options However, if this doesn’t solve the problem another option is to uninstall Clash of Clans and re-install it. Yes, that sounds scary, and no one wants to lose their entire village by uninstalling the game. You won’t. Obviously proceed at your own risk and use caution. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone If the game is backed up to Google+ or Google Games (an option in settings) your progress is saved. Meaning you can uninstall Clash, reinstall it, and restore your progress simply by going into settings and connecting to Google+, and it will restore your village in less than 10 seconds. However, if you never linked the two, this won’t work. So do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it’s backed up. The guide above goes over a few details regarding transferring the game to a new phone, which is also how you can save progress. That said, if you can’t open the game you can’t link it to Google Games. Do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it is saved. Conclusion This is a big problem. Supercell states that clearing the Google Play Store cache is your only option, and it should solve any issues. They’re currently looking into other options, and will offer up additional information if available. At the end of the day, did clearing the cache or data fix it for you? Let us know in the comments below. Those who fixed it using other methods, feel free to share it below. The December update was loaded with content and a Christmas theme. Expect a bug fixing update in 2017 along with removal of the winter theme. 241 Responses 01/26/2016 kim Reply No, it did not work for me.

Hope it helps! 01/28/2016 JUCARIBU Reply THAT WORK FOR ME THANKS 01/31/2016 Albertman Reply My clash restored and updated after i deleted the cache and data from google play store and play store services 02/02/2016 C. Sims Reply Listen to the man or woman lol… Delete all data in “Google Play Store” & “Google Play Services” from your phones settings… this guaranteed to work (then go back to Google play store, accept terms. Then update the app)… from what I know it works with newer phones, if not you could be out of luck. 04/19/2016 ScottManJo Reply Finally got all my favorite Supercell games loaded onto my Galaxy Tab E Lite. Be sure to clear out the Cache & Date from the following 3 apps: Google Play Services, Google Play Store AND Google Play Games. I was able to get CoC & Boom Beach by clearing the first 2 but only could get Clash Royale after clearing Google Play Games. Hope this helps! Good luck & god speed! 05/02/2016 Jeremy Reply ^^ had to do all 3 for mine to work also! Thanks. 07/17/2016 Michael Reply OMG DUDE THANKS!! I got the same device and got super nervous when I couldnt get clash of clans! Your a lifesaver! 10/26/2016 Arjun Reply Now This worked for me.. erazin all 3 of those.. 05/27/2016 Uhoh Reply Worked for me too. Thanks! 02/06/2016 Laryssa Reply I have the g4 it didn’t work for me. Won’t even come up when I search it. Neither does boom beach so I am guessing it has something to do with supercell. Very frustrating because I have been playing for over a year 04/24/2016 Emily Reply Same here, very frustrated and I can’t back it up as to is so I can’t uninstall and reinstall even if I could. 02/20/2016 Shaun Reply i am having this issue with needing a redeem code to even get on the play store now! 02/29/2016 Moaz Reply Thank you very much, it worked immedietly after i did these easy steps, am really grateful :-) thx again 03/20/2016 Logan Reply Didn’t work for me. It said the cache was cleared, but still refused to download. 03/22/2016 anirban mitra Reply m using nokia x series and google play store is not supported in my device..how can i back up if i uninstall it 03/26/2016 Amanda George Reply I just bought a new tablet and it is saying device in not compatible. I have nothing to clear out. I don’t understand. 07/03/2016 wardojr Reply try updating play store service… 01/26/2016 sol goslin Reply No it diddnt work. I had hopes it would but no such luck. This sucks. I cant even get to the supercell customer service/help line. There may be other issues with this though. Im also noticing a significant drop in the speed of my device, so it may be something that either supercell got in its system, or someone hacked google and delivered a little viral surprise. If thats the case Im sure it will make itself known in a bigger than life fashion. Hopefully that isnt the case. Keep posting updates on what happens. A LOT of people are locked out of the game through this. 07/22/2016 Clara Icasiano Reply just uninstall in play games then install it again. Hope it works :) \ 01/26/2016 Tom Reply no…. 01/26/2016 Steve Reply Hi. I’m on an amazon fire tablet which doesnt support google+ so my game isn’t backed up.

This isn’t the first time and they always say the same fixes and is not working. He brought a new phone and 3_4 months , the same problem. And with their lack of customer service good luck on their emails telling you to contact them in the game. If not fixed soon I will retire my three accounts and so will my friend with four, and its sad seeing that we both spent over $150 on accounts each. 01/28/2016 Nathalie Blues Reply I have spent over $1300 and lead a clan where my friends have spent the same.

In the top left corner it says “sign in” click that and something will pop and start loading. Wait until it says “Would you like to laod Chief Whateveryournameis village?

I cleared the cache in the store and game. That didn’t work. I uninstalled CoC. It didn’t show up in the Play Store. I went to Google Play Games app and was able to install from there.

My wife and I both have LG V410 tablets. They are both Android 5.0.2, same kernel versions, build numbers, etc. Hers works fine and had no issues at all. Mine is completely hosed. Tried updating, no dice. Tried Clearing the data and cache, same. Tried uninstalling\reinstalling, no longer able to even see COC in Google Play. Re-tried clearing the GP cache and data, still not available. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply For those not seeing in Google Play store after installing, You have to go to Google Play Games app in order to install after uninstalling. Your device is listed as not compatible so it will not show up. Also, if you find a copy of the new update By searching coc apk file on Google, it will install by side loading also. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply Here is a link to the latest download for sideloading. http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/supercell/clash-of-clans/clash-clans-8-116-2-android-apk-download/ 01/27/2016 Shawn Reply S5 being playing for a year now suddenly cant play, this is unacceptable, why was the upgrade not tested, when will you resolve it?! 01/27/2016 Umang Reply For everyone who’s facing this problem..go to Google play store through your browser, log in and install the game.

It did not show up on play store but yes did show on play game. Click install on play game redirect me to play store but is list under incompatible device. No install button after that 2. Read comment here and have tried clear cache, data and uninstall update for play store, play game, and play service. Still no luck. Not even show up in play store. 3. Post my comment here and back try again. It just suddenly show up. Install it and play.. No lag no issue. Around 1 hours of time for me to make that god damn stupid install button appear in my play store for doc game! Stupid conclusion from me after tried to install it. Someone say clear 3 time and bulk update. So, MAYBE after we have clear that, it will automatic download the update for playstore and it need sometime for that and without any notification on it. Give it some time after clear cache and data than try again. Hope that’s help. 01/27/2016 Sean Reply Motorola moto 3. Cleared cacache. Nope. Cleared data. Nope.

I hope it works for you all as well. Happy Clashing 01/27/2016 Mike Reply See Dennis comment for fix 01/27/2016 Karl Reply It seems the problem appears when you are in the CoC page in Play Store. Then you get the message of incompatibility. I cleared Play Store cache and data once. Not solved. Did it once more and restarted the phone. Not solved. Instead chose option ‘update all’ on notification drop-down menu. It updated CoC! Opened CoC page in Play Store. Did still after update say device not compatible and no option to open the game. But I can open CoC on the screen shortcut! Problem solved. 01/27/2016 Alex Reply Okay look it worked for me 1. Settings 2. Storage 3. Uninstall Google Play Store 4.

I decided to uninstall the game and check the store, where it still said my device (LG phone) wasn’t compatible. Vexing to say the least. The thing that did the trick was checking in Google Play Games (different application from Play Store) > My Games > Clash of Clans. I was able to download and install CoC from here and it worked.

My son however, just got a new Alcatel One Touch when he opened it, we updated all apps. Google Play shows the app as attached to his previous apps, but will not let us load it on his phone. We tried the “Clear Cache” fix even thought the phone was 2 hours old. This did not fix it. He is the entire reason I play the game. If his can’t be fixed, I will delete mine soon as well.

Ceilidh Millar reports.  <br /> <span itemprop="name" content="Google App translate"></span><br /> <span itemprop="description" content=""></span><br /> <span itemprop="duration" content="127"></span><br /> <span itemprop="thumbnail" content="http://cfvod.kaltura.com/p/1752871/sp/175287100/thumbnail/entry_id/0_va7o1pmc/version/100002"></span><br /> <span itemprop="width" content="610"></span><br /> <span itemprop="height" content="343"></span><br /> Ibrahim Haj-Ibrahim is improving his English with a little help from technology.  “It gives you an answer so fast” said Haj-Ibrahim. Since moving to Victoria in February 2016, the Syrian refugee and father of four has been using the Google Translate App to overcome language barriers.  The digital interpreter technology could soon be used across the Island to help other newcomers integrate into society.  Google Translate has partnered with the Inter-cultural Association of Greater Victoria to launch the “We Speak Translate” Project. It’s the first program of its kind in the world.  “I had this idea to partner with Google and use the Google Translate App as a community-wide symbol of inclusion” said Kate Longpre, ICA’s community integration co-ordinator. “We want [newcomers] to access services, feel welcome and be able to integrate into society. The language piece and ability to communicate is key.”  The ICA hopes to train as many people as possible to use the app including businesses, public services and schools.  Staff from Google will hold a training session on April 12 to promote the project in the community.  “Google Translate is already intuitive and easy to use,” said Roque Silva from Google Translate, who will be leading the training next week. “There are some awesome features like instant camera translations, so you can automatically translate signs.”  Participants who complete the training will receive a ‘We Speak Translate’ decal, which Longpre hopes will represent a symbol of inclusiveness.  “Wherever newcomers are going and they see these symbols, they’ll realize that this is a welcoming place” said Longpre.  According to the Victoria Foundation, more than 1,400 immigrants and refugees settle in Greater Victoria each year.  For more information on the project, visit ICA Victoria.       Previous Bon Jovi, battling bronchitis, postpones his weekend shows Next Making history — B.C. election sees first transgender candidates Related Articles Capital Region to commemorate 100th anniversary of Vimy battle April 06, 2017 Ombudsperson calls for payment, apologies to fired public health researchers April 06, 2017 Making history — B.C. election sees first transgender candidates April 06, 2017 CP Regional News Masse close to backstroke world record on opening day of Canada Trials April 06, 2017 Windy weather heading for B.C.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Inside the car-eat-car world of self-driving technology by marisa kendall The self-driving car industry was once a close-knit community, Stanford's Smith said, but the Waymo lawsuit illustrates how far it's come since those early days. — DPA/Zuma Press/TNS SAN JOSE, California: First, it was just a dream. Then it became a quirky research project undertaken by a handful of the nerdiest engineers in the robotics industry.  Now self-driving cars are on the brink of transforming transportation. The industry creating the technology for autonomous vehicles has morphed from a collaborative space of free-flowing ideas into a high-speed road race where the winners will seize a market expected to reach US$77bil (RM341.57bil) by 2035, and the losers will be left in the dust.  "The money involved – the money expended in these research efforts and the money expected if they're successful – has just ballooned and become so much more concrete and attainable," said Bryant Walker Smith, a scholar with Stanford Law School who specialises in self-driving car law.  Major players – Google's Waymo, Tesla and Uber – are fighting to set the industry standard for consumer-ready autonomous vehicles. Each has much at stake – for Uber, autonomous vehicles could be the ride-hailing startup's best shot at profitability. But the road ahead is marred by potholes and speed bumps.  The intense competition already has spawned at least two significant lawsuits. Coveted engineers working on autonomous cars are regularly switching companies. And a new class of scrappy startups creating self-driving software has emerged, poised to take market share from the established giants.  Meanwhile, the major automakers, such as GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, are staking out their claims to the industry by investing in and partnering with the key tech players. It's too soon to tell what these marriages will yield, but several teams appear to be eyeing ride-hailing networks that could pose an added threat to Uber and Lyft.  Nowhere is the tension better illustrated than in the contentious court battle between Google's Waymo and Uber. Waymo says its former engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential company files before leaving to found his own autonomous vehicle startup. The documents allegedly included designs used in Waymo's LiDAR sensor – one of the key technology components that lets self-driving cars "see" the road.  Levandowski founded Otto, an autonomous trucking startup later acquired by Uber. Now Waymo says Uber is employing trade secrets to replicate Waymo's LiDAR sensors, and has asked a federal judge in San Francisco to prohibit Uber from using that technology – an order that could potentially devastate Uber's self-driving car program. A hearing is set for the first week of May, and Uber is scheduled to respond to Waymo's allegations this week.  Trade secret fights are common in Silicon Valley, but one thing that makes this one unique is Google's involvement, which highlights the priority it is placing on its self-driving car program.  "Google doesn't sue people – period," said Eric Goldman, director of Santa Clara Law's High Tech Law Institute. "It's very exceptional to find Google as a plaintiff."  The self-driving car industry was once a close-knit community, Stanford's Smith said, but the Waymo lawsuit illustrates how far it's come since those early days.  "A lot of people were doing a lot of the same things at the same time – working at a university, consulting with a company and starting their own startup," he said. "Researchers were pretty freely sharing information."  Tesla filed a similar lawsuit against a former employee in January. The suit accuses former Autopilot program manager Sterling Anderson of nabbing Tesla's confidential information and trying to recruit at least a dozen of the company's engineers before leaving to found a competing startup.  Anderson and Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google's self-driving car program, recently launched self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation.  "Tesla understands that some employees may decide to pursue other opportunities or even to create a startup of their own, and Tesla is typically supportive of their personal ambitions and respectful of their decisions," the company's lawyers wrote. "However, Tesla cannot sit idly by when an employee like Anderson abuses his position of trust."  A lawyer for Aurora did not respond to a request for comment.  Tesla, which says two of its engineers ended up following Anderson to Aurora, isn't the only company struggling to retain its top talent. A wave of nearly 20 people left Uber's Pittsburgh-based, self-driving car program in November and December, said a person familiar with the matter, with many of them joining Argo AI – a competing startup founded by an ex-Uber engineer. And last year, two of Google's top self-driving car executives left to start self-driving car startup Nuro.ai.  Seeing those key people depart is especially painful in the self-driving car space, experts say, where there already is a shortage of talent because of the nascent state of the technology.  "Finding and recruiting the top talent is really the name of the game," said Karl Iagnemma, co-founder and CEO of nuTonomy, a Massachusetts-based startup working on software for self-driving cars. "It's intense competition to get those people."  Data also is a priority – companies must collect hours of driving data to teach their software to navigate the road. Google got an early start – the company began testing self-driving Prius cars in 2009, and its spinoff Waymo now has about 60 cars collecting data.  Uber gathers information in a similar way, operating dozens of self-driving cars in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Tempe, Arizona. Tesla is mining data from the thousands of customers driving with its cars' Autopilot feature.  Some smaller startups are taking a different approach. Palo Alto-based Nauto charges US$400 (RM1,775) for kits that let taxi drivers, fleet operators and Uber and Lyft drivers retrofit their cars with cameras that give alerts when a driver is doing something unsafe like tailgating. Those sensors funnel driving data back to the company, which is working on fully autonomous software.  Apple, meanwhile, reportedly is working on a secretive self-driving car initiative called Project Titan, though details remain scant.  So does information on how some of the industry's main players plan to profit from their self-driving technology. But as hints of future business plans emerge, there are signs of overlap that could add to the competition. Uber is betting its future on autonomous vehicles that can someday replace human drivers in its ride-hailing network. Tesla has expressed interest in creating its own ride-hailing network, and Waymo is rumoured to be eyeing similar plans.  When it comes to the actual technology behind their cars, the companies are even more tight-lipped. One key feature most autonomous vehicles share is LiDAR – sensors that use lasers to create a 3D image of the car's surroundings. That's the technology at the heart of the Waymo vs Uber lawsuit.  Waymo says it invested tens of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of engineering hours to build its own sensors, which would cost up to US$60,000 (RM266,160) off the shelf, only to have Uber copy that work.  Trade secrets related to that technology are so precious to Waymo that when the court fight began, Waymo refused even to tell Uber which secrets it was accusing its rival of misappropriating.  However the case plays out, it could have major repercussions for the industry.  "If Google were to get everything that it is seeking," Smith said, "it could stop Uber's self-driving car programme." — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested UTAR among top young varsities Speculation driving up tech stocks on Bursa, but many don't want to miss the party Joy over bumper harvest Don't tear down Ampang Park for MRT, say traders Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Eco-friendly mattress for sound sleep Flood mitigation work begins in Taman Sungai Besi Indah No information on Russian casualties in Syria - RIA cites embassy advertisement Latest News Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news Alphabet moves two top Google Fiber executives off project Trump sued by Twitter over bid to unmask @Alt-Agency handle Samsung tips best quarterly profit in over three years as chips soar China's Ant seeks to allay MoneyGram security fears Most Viewed in Tech Trump sued by Twitter over bid to unmask @Alt-Agency handle Intel CEO pay rises to US$19.1mil as security costs climb Alphabet moves two top Google Fiber executives off project Adidas to mass-produce 3D-printed shoe with Silicon Valley startup Forget Apple; Xiaomi CEO now wants to be more like Costco Samsung tips best quarterly profit in over three years as chips soar Udacity self-driving taxi spin-off Voyage takes aim at Uber Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news China's Ant seeks to allay MoneyGram security fears Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM As millennials ‘Venmo’ each other money, banks fight back with their own mobile apps by james rufus koren Apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other. — Dreamstime/TNS Odds are, you've at least heard of Venmo, but there's also a good chance you haven't used the mobile app or anything else like it to send money to family or friends.  But that's likely to change over the next few years, as banks, payment companies and even the likes of Google and Facebook push so-called peer-to-peer, or p2p, payment systems – a medium of exchange with revolutionary potential.  The apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other, and they even could make inroads at the cash register and with businesses that send refunds and other payments to their customers.  These systems will get a boost later this year when a coalition of the nation's biggest banks roll out Zelle, a mobile and online money-transfer network that will let any customer of nearly every US bank send money to customers of any other bank using only a phone number or e-mail address.  Analysts say the bank-led system – and the related marketing push – should bring online and mobile peer-to-peer payments to a larger audience. Even competitors, notably the popular money transfer app Venmo, say the Zelle rollout could boost their fortunes by making digital-money transfers more mainstream.  "We don't see it as a winner-take-all scenario," said Josh Criscoe, a spokesman for Venmo owner PayPal. "We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash."  Online and mobile peer-to-peer payment systems have grown rapidly over the last few years, and analysts expect that to continue. In a report published in March, finance industry research firm Aite Group estimated that Americans made about US$147bil (RM652.16bil) in digital p2p transfers last year, up from US$100bil (RM443.65bil) the year before.  Those are big numbers, to be sure, but last year's sum still only accounted for about 12% of the more than US$1.2tril (RM5.32tril) that Americans paid each other that year, mostly in cash.  That means there's still plenty of growth ahead, said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group. In her report, she estimated that the volume of digital p2p payments will more than double by 2020, topping US$316bil (RM1.40tril).  "Not that many consumers are using mobile payments yet," Baker said, noting that though these payments are more common among young consumers in big coastal cities, they're not so ubiquitous elsewhere. "I'm a Gen-X person and I live in Denver – I hadn't heard of Venmo until 2015."  There are plenty of players in the p2p game.  Square Inc, the payments company behind the tiny white credit card reader that plugs into a smartphone, has a p2p service of its own, Square Cash, which launched in 2013.  Following the geometric theme, there's also Circle, a Boston firm that started the same year and specialises in cross-border p2p transfers in dollars, euros and British pounds.  Facebook and Google, too, allow users to send money to friends. Google has Google Wallet, which started as a mobile wallet app but became a p2p payment tool in 2015, and Facebook users have been able to send money through Facebook Messenger since 2015.  Square, Google and Facebook don't report the volume of payments made through their p2p systems, but Facebook in regulatory filings has said that only "a relatively small percentage" of its users have used the payments feature.  Venmo is arguably the biggest name in peer-to-peer transfers. It even has the coveted status, like Google, Uber and a few others, of becoming a verb – as in "Venmo me."  Founded in 2009, the company was acquired in 2012 by payment services provider Braintree, which was acquired the following year by online payments giant PayPal – which offers p2p payments under its own name too.  But the biggest players in the market are still the banks.  Last year, Venmo users transferred US$17.6bil (RM78.08bil). That's more than double the volume from 2015, but it's also much less than the $28 billion transferred in 2016 through QuickPay, JPMorgan Chase's peer-to-peer payment system. And that's just one bank.  Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other major financial institutions have had their own p2p transfer programs for years, though it can sometimes be clunky for bank customers to send money to people with accounts at other financial institutions.  Aite Group estimates that of all the digital p2p transfers Americans made last year, non-bank systems such as Venmo accounted for only about 17% of that. Banks accounted for the rest, though much of that likely was made through banks' websites, not mobile apps, and much of it was money transferred between customers of the same bank.  In part, that's a statement about who uses different systems, and what they are used for. Venmo and other non-bank systems are accessed about twice as often as bank systems, but for much smaller transactions, according to Aite Group. The average money transfer on a non-bank system is US$135 (RM599); the average for bank systems is US$1,359 (RM6,029), according to the report.  That might suggest that parents sending money to a student for college tuition, for instance, might be more likely to transfer money through a bank, while students are much more likely to split a restaurant bill or bar tab using Venmo.  The payment app is also a social network in its own right, with users sending messages to friends when they transfer money – a feature Venmo pioneered. Those messages shed light on what's behind each transaction and indicate that Venmo is most often used among friends over food and drink, said Criscoe, the Venmo spokesman.  "Pizza is the No. 1 emoji on Venmo; beer is a close follow," he said, adding that other messages suggest users are splitting bigger-ticket items too, such as rent.  Though Venmo and other non-bank payment systems are still a small part of the p2p market, banks want to make sure they keep their place in the financial order and keep their customers.  This summer, Early Warning, a company owned by some of the nation's largest banks, will release Zelle, a payment system built to compete with Venmo and others – and, banks hope, to make digital p2p payments more mainstream.  Along with the release, Early Warning will kick off a marketing campaign showing not only how Zelle works but how it might be used. Lou Anne Alexander, president of Early Warning's payments group, said the focus will be on appealing to older consumers who might not have tried p2p payments.  "We're trying to take (p2p) from millennials to the mainstream_customers might use a product like this," Alexander said. "That might be managing contributions to the high school marching band or it might be renting a home on the beach with friends or family."  Zelle traces it roots back to 2011, when Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase set out to build a system – initially called ClearXchange – that would allow their customers to send money to each other using only phone numbers and email addresses. Before, customers could only transfer money to friends and family by entering account and routing numbers – information customers often didn't know and might be concerned about sharing.  Zelle is essentially a souped-up, rebranded version of ClearXchange. It will be available to anyone with a US bank account, and it aims to overcome some of the limitations and confusion around the ClearXchange system.  Sarah Grotta of research and consulting firm Mercator Advisory Group said banks didn't do a great job of explaining that ClearXchange would allow customers to send money to customers of other banks.  Part of the problem, she said, was that every bank has its own name for its ClearXchange-powered p2p system, including Chase QuickPay, Wells Fargo SurePay and Capital One P2P Payments.  "It wasn't well-marketed that someone at Chase could pay someone at Bank of America because they had different marketing and different branding," Grotta said. "You could pay someone at any financial institution, but people never realized that."  To address that problem, banks over the next few months will begin rebranding their p2p transfer systems to include Zelle in the name. Chase, for instance, will start calling its system "QuickPay with Zelle." Customers of more than a dozen big banks – representing most US account holders – will be able to transfer money through the banks' mobile apps. For other banks and credit unions, customers will be able to do so through the Zelle mobile app, set to be released this summer.  Once the system is running and the marketing campaign kicks off, Grotta expects Zelle to be a hit.  "This is going to be a much better user experience than the banks had before," she said. "I think it will start to catch on once people see that they can in fact send money to another person at another financial institution."  For banks, the stakes are high. Though Venmo and other money transfer apps are tiny by comparison, Baker said banks are rightfully worried about what might happen if their customers interact more often with outside payment companies.  If a customer opens an outside p2p payment app once a day and their mobile banking app just once a week, the payment company has more opportunities to sell that customer on products and services the bank would otherwise provide, she said.  "Once Venmo builds up a strong enough customer base, then it can say, 'Hey, come get a credit card from us,' or 'Come get a home loan from us,'" Baker said. "That's the approach some providers are hoping to take."  Banks see other advantages too. Mary Harman, an executive in Bank of America's consumer payments division, said it's expensive for banks to process checks and move cash around, so an increase in digital p2p payments could cut costs.  She said banks also want to give customers the services and options they want. Some customers, she said, might prefer using Venmo; others might prefer the implied security of managing financial transactions exclusively through their bank.  "We serve 65-million households in the US, and not everyone will act the same way," Harman said. We have to recognise that and have different products available in different places." — Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested UTAR among top young varsities Speculation driving up tech stocks on Bursa, but many don't want to miss the party Joy over bumper harvest Don't tear down Ampang Park for MRT, say traders Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Pedalling from Kangar to Putrajaya to spread obesity message Copter ‘quietly’ attracts interest Heartfelt rewards await mothers advertisement Latest News Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news Alphabet moves two top Google Fiber executives off project Trump sued by Twitter over bid to unmask @Alt-Agency handle Samsung tips best quarterly profit in over three years as chips soar China's Ant seeks to allay MoneyGram security fears Most Viewed in Tech Trump sued by Twitter over bid to unmask @Alt-Agency handle Intel CEO pay rises to US$19.1mil as security costs climb Alphabet moves two top Google Fiber executives off project Adidas to mass-produce 3D-printed shoe with Silicon Valley startup Forget Apple; Xiaomi CEO now wants to be more like Costco Samsung tips best quarterly profit in over three years as chips soar Udacity self-driving taxi spin-off Voyage takes aim at Uber Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news China's Ant seeks to allay MoneyGram security fears Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Streaming music users in India are estimated to grow rapidly and reach 273 million by 2020. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) recently launched its music subscription service – Google Play Music All Access – in the Indian market, which is already crowded with several local players such as Saavn, Gaana and Airtel. Other global players are also looking to grab a piece of this market, with Apple Music already present and Amazon Prime Music likely to be launched in 2018. Google will be a relatively late entrant in this high-growth market, and is likely to face intense competition. However, by launching its services at a competitive price in the region, Google can not only promote its brand but also generate steady revenues from its music segment in the long term.

App-Based Growth Strategy The Indian streaming music market, although small in size, is growing rapidly. A KPMG study suggests that India will be among the top 10 world music markets by value in the next few years. While piracy is rampant in the market, with less than 10% of music purchased legally, there has been a clear shift towards digital streaming in conjunction with the country’s rapidly growing smartphone adoption and internet penetration. With cheap music streaming subscription plans available, many consumers are likely to shift towards legal – and convenient – ways to access music. Google is looking to develop a competitive edge in the market through a cheaper monthly subscription, free cloud storage for subscribers and minimal use of mobile data. While it is entering an already competitive market, these features could help the company gain customers. However, other players are already working on differentiation based on content. Local player Saavn launched Saavn Original Content, non-music audio content for its subscribers, while Apple Music is collaborating with local artists to create original content. India is an important market for Google’s future, and the company is seeing significant growth in revenues from the country. Google’s revenues from India reportedly doubled over the past two years. However, with players such as Chinese search engine Baidu looking to enter the market with an app-based strategy, Google will need to establish itself firmly in the region and increase adoption of its apps. To this end, the launch of Google Play Music could not only drive revenues for the company in India, but also improve its overall foothold in the market. The Indian music streaming segment is still in nascent stages, but with very high growth potential. Google is a relatively late entrant in the market, but its high brand value and technological advantages can help the company establish itself as a strong player. While the launch may not have a material impact on its revenues in the near term, it will give a Google a stronger position in the high-growth Indian market.

Were actually quite glad it was not named M assistant. But anyway, the premise of M is: you can receive suggestions to take actions (right from the message screen) based on the context of your conversation. All this sounds quite familiar is starts with Google and ends with Assistant. No, no, M is not a fully-fledged smartphone assistant. Its more like Google Assistants debut in Google Allo when it first came out (The major difference is that Facebook Messenger already has 1 billion monthly active users). M can offer suggestions via a pop-up bubble that can send money to your friends, request a car with ride-share apps, and coordinate plans with friends. The best example of this is: when your friend asks Where are you?, M will suggest that you share your location with them. Tap on the suggestion bubble, and you dont have to dig through chat menus to temporarily share your pin-drop. You can also tap and hold on the suggested bubble for even more suggestions. Swiping it to the side will dismiss the suggestion. Facebook has actually been testing a couple of these features for a while. Most notably, the ride-sharing suggestion has been active anytime you mention a cab, a new address, or mention needing a ride. Starting today, the following core features will be available on Messenger M: Sticker suggestions Requesting or sending money Location sharing Making plans with a friend (sets a reminder for recipients of the chat) making polls in group chats Requesting a ride from Uber or Lyft Currently, Messenger M is now rolling out to all iOS and Android users in the United States. Those of you who may find yourself outside the US will see the update eventually roll out. Facebook says we should expect to see more AI-powered features that enhance the overall experience. If youre not crazy about any of the M features, you can easily mute the assistant in Ms settings.

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares133 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu have led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on-board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks. Carson Saldanha ?` Shawn Spring I'm hoping this and Nick Jr (for the kiddos) comes sooner rather than later! freshprince_87 I hope they add it soon Lateef Alabi-Oki I think the nailed the user interface.

Tucker Sferro $35 is outrageous. You might as well jest get cable. Jacob Fulbright After you add in YouTube Red, Netflix, Hulu (or the ad-free premium Hulu), HBO GO, etc., yeah, cable isn't looking so bad anymore. Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams. Acquire more channels.

 Uber is about to fire back in the legal drama that’s gripped Silicon Valley Biz Carson Apr. 6, 2017, 9:19 PM 5,074 facebook linkedin twitter email print Uber CEO Travis KalanickREUTERS/Adnan Abidi SAN FRANCISCO — On Friday morning, Uber will finally be laying out its response to claims that its star engineer downloaded files from his former employer and took them to the ride-hailing company to build a direct competitor. Uber is expected to argue that the 14,000 files that were allegedly downloaded by Anthony Levandowski, the head of its self-driving car unit, never made it to Uber or into its self-driving technology. The company also plans to show that its Lidar unit, a laser-based sensor that's a key component of self-driving cars, is nothing like what the Google spin-out believes. The case has become a high profile Silicon Valley legal drama, featuring everything from a rock star engineer who is pleading the fifth amendment, two of the world's most powerful tech companies, and a cantankerous judge who is already showing signs of impatience at the various actors. "This is an extraordinary case," US District Judge William Alsup said during a hearing on Wednesday. "I’ve never seen a record this strong in 42 years. And you are up against it," Alsup told Uber's attorneys. "And you are looking at a preliminary injunction even if it’s true. You just can’t escape this by saying we’ve been working hard and we can’t find any hits." The missing files Uber will have to clear a high bar when it files detailed response to the claims against it on Friday. The response comes more than a month after Waymo, the self-driving car spin-out from Google's parent company Alphabet, filed its lawsuit against the ride-hailing giant. At the time, Uber only remarked that this case was "a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." In February, Waymo sued Uber, claiming that Levandowski had stolen vital Lidar technology shortly before starting his own self-driving company (which Uber later acquired). Waymo has asked the judge to issue a preliminary injunction to stop Uber from using any technology that may have been built on its proprietary information. Waymo has already claimed that Uber is stonewalling the case by not adequately searching for the documents in its systems. Of the more than 40 former Google employees that now work on Uber's self-driving car efforts, Uber randomly selected 7 employees in addition to the three mentioned in Waymo's complaint to investigate the files on their laptops and on servers. Uber said it searched more than 12 terabytes of data, the equivalent of 8.3 billion pages of text, and hasn't found any substantive hits. However, Alsup is requiring Uber to search additional terms and more employees as part of its discovery process. "What you’re telling me is not going to be a get out of jail free card," Alsup said. The twist One other reason that the case is something unlike what Alsup has seen in his career is because of the maneuvers of the engineer at the heart of the matter, Levandowski.  Anthony LevandowskiOtto Despite not being named in the lawsuit, Levandowski's lawyers told the court on Thursday that Levandowski has invoked his fifth amendment rights to prevent the disclosure of documents that could potentially lead to self-incrimination. In particular, Levandowski wants the court to not compel Uber to disclose the name of the third party that did its due diligence report in its privilege log. "You are hiding from me what the real facts are. You’re keeping me in the dark," Alsup said during Thursday's hearing. Waymo argued in a filing on Wednesday that the argument shows that "Uber was aware, prior to acquiring Otto, that Mr. Levandowski took documents from Waymo." Alsup hasn't issued an order on Levandowski's motion to scale back the privilege log and whether he buys his fifth amendment defense, but told Levandowski's lawyers to hand over an un-redacted copy of the privilege log with the suggested redactions and to also give a redacted copy to Waymo's attorneys. While Alsup wrestles with Levandowski's fifth amendment claims, Uber is preparing to lay out the beginnings of its defense on Friday. Waymo doesn't want a man who is says took 14,000 over their files to run a competitor's self-driving car program. Now it's up to Uber to argue why the court shouldn't stop it.

Free land in OpenSim VR Headsets VR QR Codes Columns / VR & AR 9  Print This Post   •    Email This Post   •   App lets you configure your VR viewer by David Kariuki · March 28, 2017 Google Cardboard-compatible viewers are a great choice for people who want to experience VR but don’t want to shell out the hundreds of dollars that the big-name headsets cost. In fact, these viewers can start at just $5, and are pretty good for watching VR videos and playing casual games. Plus, they work on most late-model smartphone, so you don’t need a new computer or lots of wires. Check out our list of 10 best VR viewers under $100 and 10 super-cheap viewers for trying out VR. However, one big problem with many of these viewers is that the smartphone has to know what lenses the viewer has, and how they’re positioned. Since the viewers are dumb — they’re just lenses in a plastic or cardboard case — you normally do this by scanning a Google Cardboard QR Code. And many manufacturers don’t provide that QR Code. Maybe they’re lazy, or maybe they want you to just use their app, and not any of the thousands of other VR apps in the app stores. This is what a Google Cardboard QR Code looks like. Note the outline of a VR viewer in the center. Whatever the reason, this is a big headache. We have a list of QR Codes here, but we don’t have a QR Code for every single headset out there. Plus, new ones keep popping up all the time. What to do? You can randomly try other codes to see if they’re close enough. Or you can use Google’s own QR Code generator, though it’s a little tricky. But now, there’s a new, easier option. Sites in VR is a virtual tourism app, but it also comes with its own QR Code generator. I tried it out, and found it relatively easy to use and quick to configure my own VR viewer, Play VR. It wasn’t instant and automatic. It took about ten minutes total, and I had to customize the inner and outer distortion, field of view, chromatic aberration, lens separation distance, screen to lens distance, and the interpupil distance. But once I was done, I had the perfect QR Code for my headset. I configured the PlayVR viewer using the Sites in VR application. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) Plus, the app already comes with a selection of ready-to-go QR Codes, in case your viewer is  the official Google Cardboard headset, or a Daydream View, SmartVR, Virtual Vizor,  Homido, Homido Mini, Dscvr,VR Fold, Wearality Sky, Vrizzmo Revolt, Mattel View-Master VR, Merge VR, Durovis Dive 5, ColorCross VR, Soyan, Geeach, Gear VR, Cardboard V2, Bobo VR Z4, Ant VR, Baofeng Small Mojing, Baofeng Storm II, VR Box, Leap-HD or Ritech 3D. (And even if your viewer isn’t one of those, sometimes one of the other QR Codes works well enough, anyway.) How to create your own custom QR Code with the app If your viewer isn’t on their list, and you want to create your own QR Code from scratch, start by downloading the app for free on the Apple or Android app store. Then touch the little icon of a viewer, then on the “viewer settings” icon.   Now you should be at a screen that lets you adjust all the techie configuration settings for your customer viewer. That includes the distortion, field of view, lens separation distance and the interpupil distance. You can also use this to modify the settings for a QR Code that was provided by the manufacturer, but doesn’t look right to you because either the manufacturer made a mistake, or it doesn’t work with your particular smartphone for some reason, or if you have weird eyes. The custom viewer settings screen of the Sites in VR app.   I tried out the process of adjusting for field of view and other features, following the online instructions. I recommend starting with the ruler setting. This allows you to set the screen size. You will need to go and find an actual ruler for this one. If you don’t have a ruler, you can set it for your phone’s official screen size, but be warned that the official specs might not be exact, and, as a result, the virtual reality view that you get might be slightly off. This is the ruler calibration screen. Put an actual ruler on top of your phone, and use the arrows until the the screen’s rulers match your own. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) For all the other settings, your phone will switch to a virtual reality view. To calibrate those settings properly, put the phone inside your virtual reality headset, then move your head until the picture looks right. Then hold your head still for a couple of seconds to save — you will see a little indicator, a circle filling, that will show you that it’s saving. Customizing for inner distortion. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.)     When at the main settings menu, go to a new setting by looking in the direction of the icon — a little blue circle will appear to help you with the selection — and pause until it activates. Then you go back to the viewer settings screen, but this time in virtual reality mode, so you can configure the other settings without taking your phone out of the headset. Here is the custom viewer settings screen in virtual reality, side-by-side view. You can see the little blue circle that is the selection cursor floating just above the “Field of View” settings button. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) It seems to switch into that mode automatically — if you need to switch back out to the regular phone view, take the phone out of the viewer, touch the screen, then touch the little cardboard viewer icon at the bottom of the screen. To go back to the virtual reality mode, just select any calibration setting again. Now you can work your way through all the other settings. Adjusting the lens separation distance. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) The lens separation distance is how far your viewer’s lenses are from one another. Again, tilt your head up and down until the picture looks good to you, then pause to save. Normally, if you were creating a custom viewer code manually with the official Google viewer profile generator tool, you would need an actual ruler or calipers to measure this. So the Sites in VR app is a big time saver here. Adjusting for screen to lens distance. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) All in all, it took me about ten minutes to get through everything and create a working viewer profile. To see whether you’re done, click on the “Test View” button and you can see a little preview of what it all looks together once it’s put together. To go back to your settings selection screen, look for the little gray circle with a square inside of it — that’s the “back” button in this app — and look at it to activate it. The Test Room screen of the Sites in VR app. Once you’re all set, you can go try out your new custom viewer settings in another VR app. Once you’ve set up your custom viewer, your phone will remember it until you change it. You can also check out the rest of Sites in VR app itself, since the main purpose of this app is virtual tourism. The viewer calibration feature is just an added bonus. Select the destinations according to country, city or desired group of attractions such as nature or museums. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) Sites in VR has about 1,700 tourism destinations from around the world, grouped by country, city or type of destination. Bursa New Thermal Spring bath in Turkey.

Except for the Virtec thing, and I’m editing David’s story now. Minethereé hmmmm, we need to generate some stories then…do they have to be truthful??? Maria Korolov If someone says a big lie, that’s a big story right there. For example, if a grid owner announces that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie both have avatars on their grid — and that you are having secret, torrid affairs with both of them, and that drama is about to erupt and destroy that grid… I might think about covering it! Sure, the grid might be potentially inviting lawsuits, but that’s the price you might have to pay for the publicity. Undeserved, negative publicity, but still — people will be talking about you! But really, the thing I care about most — and I think that most people are — is whether there’s any progress creating either a web-native or a VR-native viewer for OpenSim. I have a feeling that there are a lot of people out there that are just going through the motions now, and unless something happens, will just fade away from OpenSim. Frankly, I might be in that category myself. Which reminds me — I planned to write an article about that. Minethereé “If someone says a big lie, that’s a big story right there. For example, if a grid owner announces that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie both have avatars on their grid — and that you are having secret, torrid affairs with both of them, and that drama is about to erupt and destroy that grid… I might think about covering it!” Crap…I had heard a similar rumor in Metro!! you spoiled it! (this is a lie) Seriously though, there is still a lot going on in Opensim. You might pick up issues of VisionZ and read it sometime-) (I assume you do but ya never knowz). There is always people coming and going…mostly I see coming, even your stats indicate this. Some people are saying doom and gloom stuff but it’s just not true at all. I ignore it mostly. Carlos Loff Many people have big plans for OS right now and exactly as it stands now on tech – I see many folks motivated – Space is bigger and cheaper but not many big ready-stuff products for sale – My god if I could afford many SL Sims I could build whole functional cities 3 days eith my 3K Inventory and the suoer market there is – That brought up a new paradigm for project starters – The problem is not anymore how to pay next week SL tiers, the problem is now – How can I quit my job and work 10h/day to fill 10 VARs and bring community in to keep it all going – So Time and not Money Arielle I see more interest in easy to set up and run, home based standalones and mini grids. That is where the future will be for Opensim. Add in some better inworld building tools and materials like voxels, while maintaining hypergrid capability and I think we will see some great growth. Let Space, Sansar and HF pursue the web based viewer and professional creator market while Opensim focuses on a niche of the amateur, hobbyist builders and creators.

The Arctic Eider Society’s SIKU project to harness and preserve Inuit traditional knowledge using state-of-the-art digital tools will receive $750,000 in grant funding and hands-on support from both Google and their local support partner, the LEAP Centre, for the next year to help them bring their projects to life, Google Canada announced last week. “We’re really excited,” said Joel Heath, president of the Arctic Eider Society. “Our project is called SIKU, which is the Inuktitut word for sea ice and we’ve been basically bringing together the best of technology to benefit the Inuit.” (click to listen to the full interview with Joel Heath) Listen EN_Interview_3-20170404-WIE30 SIKU is an Inuit knowledge wiki tool and a social mapping platform, said Heath. Users can contribute to profiles as well as tag photos and comments with profiles for sea ice types, wildlife, traditional place names, using Inuktitut terminology in various dialects, Heath said. It also has a mobile app that allows users to take GPS-referenced photos and tag them to help mobilize Inuit observations on the land and out on the ice, he said. “Each of these profiles will be like a Wikipedia of Inuit knowledge, bringing together these different tools and services to help with safety on the ice and knowledge transfer, documenting Inuit observations over time and mobilizing that knowledge,” Heath said. Users of the platform can sign up using their Facebook accounts or emails. “It will be basically a social media for Inuit, by Inuit,” Heath said. The project started as a prototype for the community-driven research programs in the southeast Hudson Bay – James Bay area. “Whenever the hunters are out doing work – like a salinity profile or taking ice core samples – the results of the work would show up on their profiles,” Heath said. “So it will be a way to manage the data, for one, but to keep track, so that hunters in different communities could see the work they’ve contributed to and to see the work that’s going on in neighbouring communities.” That allows the communities to get involved in the research and interpret the results in their own knowledge system, he said. The team behind SIKU is also working to cross-reference all the sea ice terminology in various Inuktitut dialects to preserve this essential linguistic and survival knowledge, Heath said. “So the profile for the type of ice would have all those different Inuktitut dialects as well as the Canadian Ice Service term,” Heath said. “And depending where your profile is from, it would show your dialect first.” SIKU project team (left to right) Phillipe Blais, Lucassie Arragutainaq, Joel Heath, Misha Warbanski and Kristen Kownak © Arctic Eider Society In the short term the online tool will allow hunters to share safety and travel information, he said. For example, if an experienced hunter encounters dangerous ice conditions, he can take a photo of that ice and tag it with GPS coordinates to warn others less experienced hunters to avoid the area, Heath said. “But in the long term it’s also documenting changes over time,” Heath said. “The more you document those ice conditions, then you have a long time series showing how the ice has changed.” The Arctic Eider Society is also using the results it received from the SIKU prototype to teach a culturally relevant curriculum for math and science in local area schools, Heath said. “We’re teaching by using data collected by Inuit hunters and examples that are culturally relevant,” Heath said. “We’re even teaching trigonometry by looking at the angle that the eider duck dives underneath the ice, for example.” The NGO’s vision is to bring the right curriculum to the northern schools to inspire those youth to be the next generation of environmental leaders and researchers, and to provide them with training opportunities with experienced hunters, Heath said.

It is used typically to protect pilots from both countries as they fly sorties over Syria, Associated Press reports, to ensure they do not attack each other, and to avoid the possibility of midair collisions. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the Russians were informed of the imminent strikes in “multiple conversations” through the deconfliction line on Thursday. Updated at 3.03am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.53am EDT 02:53 As the missiles were launched from two US warships in the Mediterranean, Donald Trump was in Florida, where he has been hosting the Chinese president, Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort. After news broke of the strike, Trump broke off from the meeting (and a dinner of steak and carrots) to address reporters on the military action. Initial plans for a live televised address to the nation reportedly had to be scrapped due to technical difficulties of broadcasting from the resort. Here are Trump’s remarks in full: My fellow Americans, On Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians using a deadly nerve agent. Assad choked out the lives of innocent men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of god should ever suffer such horror. Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, and ignored the urging of the UN security council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad’s behaviour have all failed and failed very dramatically. As a result the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilise, threatening the United States and its allies. ‘Assad choked out lives’: Donald Trump announces US strikes in Syria Tonight I call on all civilised nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We ask for god’s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed. And we hope that as long as America stands for justice that peace and harmony will in the end prevail. Goodnight and god bless America and the entire world. Thank you.

Secretary of state Rex Tillerson told reporters at Mar-a-Lago that it had not: There were no discussions or prior contacts, nor had there been any since the attack with Moscow. But the Pentagon said Russia had been alerted in advance, through military channels. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the Russians were informed in “multiple conversations” on Thursday, through the “deconfliction channel” – a communications channel to the Russian base at Latakia used to avoid collisions or exchanges of fire between US and allied planes and Russian planes: There are Russians at the base and we took extraordinary precautions to not target the area where the Russians are. This will raise many questions, says Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman: The Russians are sure to have routed that warning to Assad, raising immediate questions about what the strike will have accomplished.

Peskov said Putin sees the strikes on Syria as “aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law, and under a false pretext”. Peskov claimed Syria has no chemical weapons, and that the destruction of them has been monitored by international observers. He said Trump’s move would have consequences for the relationship between the two countries. “With this step Washington has struck a significant blow to Russian-American relations, which were already in a sorry state,” said Peskov.

The Pentagon said 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from warships USS Ross and Porter in the eastern Mediterranean in the early hours of Friday morning, Syria time. Unconfirmed reports from Homs province said the airbase was destroyed, and some personnel killed. Some reports said senior officers had evacuated the base before the airstrikes happened. Donald Trump said the strike was a direct response to the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 70 people: Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.

U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Porter conducts strike operations from the Mediterranean against Syria. Photograph: Reuters US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said the strike did not indicate a shift in US policy towards Syria, despite its significant shift from the previous stance taken by the Trump administration. There was an angry response in Russia, where the Kremlin warned that the strikes would cause “significant damage to US-Russia ties”. Tillerson said Russia bore responsibility for its handling of the 2013 deal that was supposed to remove Assad’s chemical weapons stockpile: They would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in Syria. Clearly Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013. Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement. Tillerson said there had been “no discussions” with Moscow before or since the strike. But the Pentagon confirmed that Russia – a key Assad ally – had been informed in advance of the strike through military channels: Russian forces were notified in advance of the strike using the established deconfliction line. The Pentagon also said it believes the strike has “severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure”. Support for the US action came from the UK, Australia, Israel, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, while Iran condemned the strikes.

Moscow said the strikes had been carried out on an “invented pretext” and claimed the Syrian army did not have chemical weapons. The strikes, it said, would do “significant damage to US-Russia ties” and created a “serious obstacle” to creating an international coalition to defeat Isis. Russian president Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said, views the strikes as an attempt to deflect world attention from civilian deaths in Iraq – where at least 150 people died in a series of coalition airstrikes in Mosul last month.

Iran is one of the biggest supporters of Assad and its hardline paramilitary Revolutionary Guard is deeply involved in the war. Ghasemi described Iran as “the biggest victim of chemical weapons in recent history”, referencing Iraqi use of the weapons during its 1980s war. He said Iran condemned the missile launch “regardless of the perpetrators and the victims” of Tuesday’s chemical weapons attack in Syria. He also warned it would “strengthen terrorists” and further add to “the complexity of the situation in Syria and the region”.

Boris Johnson is in Moscow on Monday and will meet Lavrov. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.31am EDT 01:31 Shaun Walker The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent reports: The Russian foreign ministry has said it will make a statement soon on the US action. There has been a lot of negative comment so far, comparing Trump’s move to previous US incursions in the Middle East, but little concrete information about the potential consequences, as people wait for a signal from the Kremlin on how Russia is going to play this. The Pentagon has said there were “multiple conversations” with Russia before the strike, and that “extraordinary precautions” were taken not to target Russians at the base, but we are also yet to hear anything from either the Kremlin or military HQ on how these discussions looked from Moscow. A report on the state news said the US had launched the attack after “baseless” claims that Assad had used chemical weapons. Senator Viktor Ozerov said Trump was “following in the footsteps of Bush Jr who looked for chemical weapons in Iraq, and we all know how that worked out”. Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator and former top foreign policy official, wrote on Twitter shortly before the US missiles were launched: In the 21st century, every US president has had a war in the Middle East, if not two. If Trump goes into Syria, he’ll sit alongside Bush and Obama. Vladimir Safronkov, Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, said: The authors of these plans should stop and think what military operations in Iraq, Libya, and other countries led to. All the consequences will be on the conscience of those who came up with these plans.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.19am EDT 01:19 Australia 'strongly supports' US strike Gareth Hutchens Australia’s prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he “strongly supports” the US military strike on Syria’s al-Shayrat airfield, calling it a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response to the Syrian regime’s “shocking war crime”. He said Australia was in close discussions with its allies about the next steps, but said the airstrike had sent an important signal that the world would not tolerate the use of chemical weapons. In a specially-convened press conference in Sydney on Friday, Turnbull said: It sends a strong message to the Assad regime. The retribution has been proportionate and it has been swift. We support the United States in that swift action. Turnbull said it was important to note that the international community was not at war with the Assad regime, and the US had made it clear it was not seeking to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. However, he said events of this week raised “very real questions” over whether Assad could remain as leader of Syria: This chemical attack was a horrific crime, shocking, even in the context of that brutal war. Turnbull said the US had not asked for more military support, but he left open the possibility of providing it in the future: There is no question that this shocking conflict in Syria is crying out itself for a resolution and we certainly will continue to work with our allies and our partners to see a resolution to this shocking war.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.08am EDT 01:08 Elle Hunt A mainstay of US warfare for more than 20 years, the Tomahawk cruise missile had been considered the most likely weapon for any strike by the Trump administration against the Syrian military. And so it proved. The US launched its surprise attack on an inland airbase near Homs early on Thursday morning, with 59 of the missiles deployed from two naval destroyers. USS Ross and USS Porter were in the eastern Mediterranean sea off Syria’s western coast. More than 6.25m long (20ft) and weighing 1,590kg (3,500lb), the Tomahawk land-attack missile is billed by the US navy as “an all-weather, long range, subsonic cruise missile” able to be launched from either ships or submarines. They commonly carry warheads of up to 454kg (1,000lb), and are designed to fly at low altitudes towards even heavily defended land targets with extreme accuracy. Their chief advantage in warfare is that they are unmanned, guided by GPS to targets more than 1,600km (1,000 miles) away at high subsonic speeds of 885km/h (550mph).

State news agency RIA quoted Viktor Ozerov, head of the defence and security committee at the Russian upper house of parliament, saying the US strikes could undermine the fight against terrorism. Ozerov said Russia would call for an urgent meeting of the UN security council: This [the attack] could be viewed as an act of aggression of the US against a UN nation.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google today announced that it has inked a partnership with startup Elastic to offer a fully managed version of the Elasticsearch and Kibana open-source software that the startup sells and supports. The core Elasticsearch is a search engine for structured and unstructured data, while Kibana provides a compatible search dashboard and visualizations. In addition to providing what’s available for free, Google’s service will include features that are only available with the startup’s high-end subscriptions, like graph analytics, alerts, and commercial support. The service will arrive in the second half of 2017, Elastic said in a blog post. In other words, the service will be showing up around two years after public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) released an Elasticsearch service. But at the time there was no formal deal between Amazon and Elastic. That service remains available alongside Elastic’ dedicated offering on the AWS Marketplace, and AWS’ own Amazon Cloudsearch service. On the Microsoft Azure public cloud you can use Elastic’s offering from the Azure Marketplace or Microsoft’s own Azure Search. The New York Times, Shopify, Quizlet, and Verizon all do business with both Elastic and Google, Nan Boden, head of global technology partners at Google Cloud, wrote in a blog post. Today’s announcement comes a few weeks after Google said its cloud would be getting an embedded version of Trifacta’s data cleaning software. In addition to expanding its portfolio of services, Google seeks to look like the best cloud for companies’ new and existing applications by expanding its geographical reach and refreshing its underlying infrastructure. For example, yesterday Google said it would be contributing to the development of an undersea cable in the Indian Ocean that will speed up data transfer in the region for cloud customers. Elastic, for its part, most recently raised funding in 2014, with a $70 million round. Other search offerings include Algolia, Lucene/Solr, and Swiftype. In addition to the Elasticsearch announcement, Google also said that it’s bringing its neural machine translation system to the standard edition of its Translation application programming interface (API). For the past few months this cutting-edge machine translation system was only accessible through a premium edition of the API. The service currently works with Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese, with more languages to come, Google product manager Apoorv Saxena wrote in a blog post.

We will continue to press them to make sure, because as we know, material on the Internet can have an impact when it is seen by other people.” Ministers are concerned that material available on the Internet, including hate sermons, bomb-making manuals and Islamic State videos, could radicalise Britons and inspire attacks such as last month’s car-and-knife assault in Westminster that left four people dead. May’s intervention during a three-day trip to Jordan and Saudi Arabia follows a meeting last week between Home Secretary Amber Rudd and representatives from Google, Facebook Inc, Microsoft Corp and Twitter Inc, at which they were urged to tackle the problem of terrorist content “head on.” – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: google Related Stories Related Stories Google changes ad policies again Apple, Amazon, Google join bidding for Toshiba chip unit - media Google campaign to help local SMEs go online UEM collaborates with Google Malaysia Telenor to roll out Google’s new messaging service in Asia, Europe You May Be Interested UTAR among top young varsities Speculation driving up tech stocks on Bursa, but many don't want to miss the party Joy over bumper harvest Don't tear down Ampang Park for MRT, say traders Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning You May Be Interested UTAR among top young varsities Speculation driving up tech stocks on Bursa, but many don't want to miss the party Joy over bumper harvest Don't tear down Ampang Park for MRT, say traders Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Iran condemns air strike in Syria; Britain, Australia give support Samsung tips best quarterly profit in over three years as chips soar Copter ‘quietly’ attracts interest Property Related advertisement Latest News Hyundai, Kia plan major car recall in US and S.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright disney-pixar Image caption Pixar's 2012 movie Brave was set in the Scottish Highlands A storyboard artist on Pixar's Highlands-set movie Brave is helping to give artificial intelligence developed by Google its "personality". US-based Emma Coats was an artist on Brave for four-and-a-half years and part of a Pixar crew that made a research trip to Scotland. Brave, whose lead Merida was played by Kelly Macdonald, was released in 2012. Coats now writes dialogue for Google Assistant, which runs on computers, phones and a new smart home device. The 31-year-old, who also worked on Pixar's Monsters University and makes her own short films, has fond memories of working on Brave and Scotland. 'Amazing history' In an effort to accurately portray Scottish landscapes in the animated film, director Brenda Chapman took a team of artists to Scotland. During the trip, the team visited the 5,000-year-old Callanish Stones and also traditional thatch-roof blackhouses on the Western Isles and historic Eilean Donan Castle at Dornie, near Kyle of Lochalsh. Coats said: "I was lucky enough, as an early part of the crew, to be included in the group Brenda Chapman took to Scotland. "It was amazing to see some of the history, like standing stones, blackhouses, and Eilean Donan. "It was so valuable as artists and filmmakers to be there for the things you can't see in photos, like how fast the light changes and the colour of everything when the sun comes down under the clouds, or how you can step on moss in a forest and sink to your ankles." She added: "I worked on Brave for more than four years, so I have a lot of fond memories. "The most fascinating thing was seeing the story go from drawings, paintings, and sculptures to the final computer animated film, completely fleshed out and polished. "If I had to pick one fond memory, it would be hours spent assisting Jerome Ranft, one of Pixar's sculptors, on the maquette (scale model) for Merida's horse Angus. "Jerome would put on music and then he'd work on the front end of the horse and I'd try to figure out the muscles on the back end of it. "All the time I spent as a kid drawing horses really paid off," Coats is part of a team writing "chatty" dialogue for Google Assistant, as well as doing work on other films. She said: "The Assistant gives a conversational way to access everything Google can do for you, and on the Personality Team we add delight wherever we can. "The rest of Google has all the useful parts of the Assistant covered, so the Google Assistant Personality Team really supports them by coming up with fun things the Assistant can say and do, whether that's games or things to discover."

The service is perfect for people who need an email address independent of their work one, and a far better alternative than security nightmares like YahooMail. Yet Gmail, despite the name, isn't just a great platform for email. Image: Alex Knight/Unsplash/Google Gmail makes use of the cloud, just like Dropbox or Google Drive, to store all your emails. Only you have a lot more space in Gmail than you would in a traditional cloud storage drive. That means that with a little ingenuity you can use Gmail for a whole host of other tasks. 1) Taking notes Image: Screenshot All hail the drafts folder (or label), that purgatorial part of Gmail where emails aren't sent but just left in limbo...for eternity. This is a great place to jot down snippets, thoughts, to do lists, ideas, and anything else you want to make a note of temporarily. Remember that you can get at your drafts from anywhere you've got Gmail installed, so your notes go with you everywhere, and of course you've got Gmail's advanced search features to take advantage of too. You can even attach files to your drafts as well. 2) Sending your files to the cloud Image: Screenshot Gmail works wonderfully well with IFTTT (If This Then That), a platform we've talked about many times before, and one way you can utilise this is by having Gmail attachments automatically saved to your Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, or Box accounts. Why would you do this via Gmail? It lets you upload files from anywhere you can send an email (like someone else's computer) without installing any other apps, and it also means you can save files to multiple connected cloud services at the same time. 3) Updating all your social media accounts at once Image: Screenshot This is another IFTTT one and a bit of a cheat, because it works with any email service, not just Gmail. If you send an message to a specified IFTTT address, you can post an update to all your social media accounts at once, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others. As you can get at email pretty much everywhere, you can update your social media accounts from everywhere, and there's even the option to upload pictures via email attachments. The posts will use your default privacy settings when they hit Facebook. 4) Making a private photo album Image: Screenshot Google makes it fairly easy for users to have multiple Gmail accounts, so you can set up a dedicated Gmail space for a private photo collection that only a few people have access to. The obvious use is a closed off album of baby pictures for interested friends and family. Anyone can then email over photos to the shared account, with custom labels and subject headers available to organise everything. Some of Gmail's potential for photo storage has been negated by the arrival of Google Photos, but it's still a nice alternative. 5) Keeping a diary Image: Screenshot Gmail isn't the most advanced word processor in the world, but it does have a few features in its favour, like text formatting, support for embedded images, and the various apps that let you access your account from just about any device, from iPhones to Chromebooks. It's also particularly handy for keeping a diary, because you can create new entries with new emails, and organise everything in conversation threads and through Gmail's labelling system. Your diary entries can be easily searched and printed out as well.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google may be planning to have an all-in-one smart home hub By Ida Torres - April 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Amazon may be considered the powerhouse when it comes to smart home hubs because of its Alexa-powered Echo devices, but don’t expect Google to take it lying down. Reports are saying that the tech giant is considering merging its Google Home and its Google WiFi devices to create just one all-in-one smart hub that would be able to bring you more than what its competitors like Amazon can bring. But of course, expect it to be more expensive than the current price of the Google Home. According to reports, having the two devices combined, even though they were just announced and then released last year, would actually give people a more compelling smart home hub that users will find more useful. Google actually previously tried something like this with the OneHub routers, but it didn’t really take of for some reason, which probably includes the fact that hardware wasn’t Google’s strong suit at that time. But now that they have reinvigorated their efforts in that department with the “Made by Google” branding, then maybe this second effort will bear more fruit. There are no details yet as to what this new device will have, except that it will try to compete with the likes of the Echo devices which serve as not just digital assistants, but also a way to make your home smarter. Google Home is currently priced at $129 so expect the new combined device to be more expensive than that of course. Let’s wait and see if this product will actually come to light.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | April 6, 2017 -- 23:37 GMT (16:37 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Linux and open-source software have had to content with intellectual property (IP) legal challenges for years. Now, Google has started a new effort to bring peace to potential Android IP sore points: PAX. The new Android and Google software patent protection group may help crush patent trolls. The Android Networked Cross-License, which the members call "PAX" for short, is a royalty-free, community-patent cross-license. It covers both Android and Google Applications pre-installed on devices that meet Android's compatibility requirements. Cashless payments: How one city has made electronic transactions pay off To counter a national aversion to digital payments of any kind, the northern Italian city of Bergamo has taken matters into its own hands, with some beneficial results. Read More PAX is starting with 9 members: Google, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, HTC, Foxconn Technology Group, Coolpad, BQ, HMD Global, and Allview. These companies own more than 230,000 global patents. PAX's purpose is to create a "community-driven [patent] clearinghouse, developed together with our Android partners, [that] ensures that innovation and consumer choice -- not patent threats -- will continue to be key drivers of our Android ecosystem. PAX is free to join and open to anyone." This is far from the first such effort in open-source and Linux circles. Perhaps the best known and most influential is the Open Invention Network (OIN). OIN was formed in 2005 when Linux was under legal siege from SCO for imaginary copyright violations and then Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer claimed Linux violated over 200 Microsoft patents. So, IBM, Sony, Phillips, Red Hat, and Novell formed Open Invention Network (OIN) to defend Linux against IP attacks. Since then, many major companies have joined OIN from both inside the technology business, such as Google and manufacturing companies like Damiler. PAX, however, deals specifically with Android and Google's Android applications. Will it work? It depends. Andrew "Andy" Updegrove, founding partner of the prestigious IP law firm Gesmer Updegrove LLP, explained, "The simple answer is that PAX will be judged by the company it keeps. There has been a long history of both real and symbolic patent promises. Some, like the OIN, are well funded, have attracted very broad participation, and engage in multiple ancillary activities to achieve the objective of maintaining a "no fly zone" over Linux to the greatest extent possible." On the other hand, "Others, like the multiple public non-assertion pledges of IBM, Motorola, Nokia, Oracle, Sun, and other companies relating to Linux and other core OSS more than a decade ago were largely for the PR value they achieved by showcasing the commitment of the companies involved. The PAX announcement seems to position itself somewhere in between the two, involving formal cross-licenses between participants, and therefore enforceable rights, but not an infrastructure to do more (at least insofar as one can tell from the initial announcement)." Since Android has had more than its fair share of IP troubles -- the endless war between Google and Oracle on Java and the 310 bogus patents Microsoft uses to obtain Android licensing fees -- it's to be hoped that PAX will keep new IP fights from starting. After all, in patent battles, the only sure thing is that customers will lose because of higher prices.

Uber: Everything you need to know Posted 7 hours ago by Anna Escher, Kate Conger Buckle your seatbelts! This one’s a doozy. 1/16 Anthony Levandowski starts working for Google After delving into self-driving vehicle projects as a student at UC Berkeley, Anthony Levandowski joined Google in 2007, working on Street View. His side companies that focused on self-driving efforts, 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots, were acquired by Google in 2011 for around $50 million, Bloomberg reports. 2/16 Supplier notifies Google of similar part order In July 2013, a supplier informed Google that it had received an order for a custom part from a company called Odin Wave that closely resembled Google’s own part. Odin Wave was connected to an address Levandowski owned in Berkeley, but he denied a connection to the mysterious company. Odin Wave later merged with Tyto to create LiDAR modules for self-driving cars. 3/16 14,000+ documents downloaded from Google Levandowski downloaded onto a work computer 14,000 documents from a database where Google’s self-driving car data was stored, Google alleges in its lawsuit. The download totaled 9.7 GBs, with 2 GBs related to LiDAR, technology Google believes is essential in bringing its self-driving cars to market. Two weeks later, Levandowski allegedly connected an SD drive to his computer for eight hours — during which time Google suspects he transferred the documents. On January 4 and 11, Google claims Levandowski downloaded more documents from Google Drive onto a personal device. 4/16 Levendowski meets with Uber execs Google alleges that Levandowski met with Uber executives in January while he was still employed by Google. Skip Advertisement 5/16 Levandowski forms 280 Systems/Otto Levandowski formed 280 Systems, the company that would later become Otto. 6/16 Levandowski resigns from Google Google claims Levandowski resigned abruptly without giving notice after nearly a decade at the company. 7/16 Levandowski, Otto and Uber sign a joint agreement Levandowski and Otto sign a joint defense and confidentiality agreement with Uber and CEO Travis Kalanick. The agreement allows confidentiality between the parties and protects them from future litigation. 8/16 Otto launches Otto launches out of stealth with a demo video showing a self-driving truck cruising down a Nevada freeway with no one at the wheel. Skip Advertisement 9/16 Otto acquires Tyto Remember that LiDAR company Odin Wave, a.k.a. Tyto, that Levandowski denied association with? Google claims Otto acquired it sometime in May. 10/16 Two more Google employees download documents Google alleges that two more employees, Sameer Kshirsagar and Radu Raduta, downloaded several confidential files from Google Drive before departing to work at Otto. 11/16 Uber buys Otto for $680 million In a deal worth $680 million, Uber agrees to acquire Otto and brings Levandowski and his team into its self-driving unit. 12/16 Google pursues arbitration with Levandowski and Lior Ron Google secretly initiates arbitration proceedings against Levandowski and Otto co-founder Lior Ron. The arbitration alleges that Levandowski and Ron, who also is a former Google employee, used confidential salary data to recruit Googlers. Skip Advertisement 13/16 Google receives an email intended for Uber A LiDAR vendor accidentally copies Google’s self-driving unit, which rebranded this month as Waymo, on an email showing Uber’s circuit board.

News sign-up Google hires comScore to improve online safety News, 07 April 2017 Topics Programmatic buying WASHINGTON DC: Cross-platform measurement firm comScore is partnering Google to help the embattled internet giant improve the independent brand safety reporting of ads served on YouTube. Announcing the initiative in a statement, comScore said it will use a proprietary brand safety engine built into its validated Campaign Essentials (vCE) suite of tools. This technology continuously monitors patterns within text content to determine the brand safety of ad content, comScore explained. It is also suitable for specific campaigns and operates across both mobile and desktop. "Monitoring online content for brand safety is a complex challenge, particularly in an environment that has the vast scale and growth of YouTube," said Dan Hess, Executive Vice President of Products at comScore. "We're delighted to see Google taking further action to monitor and increase brand safety, and appreciate its vote of confidence in selecting comScore to be part of this initiative," he added. Google has faced weeks of criticism following the revelation, first reported by the Times, that ads served on YouTube often appeared next to inappropriate content, including extremist sites. Following a mass advertising boycott by leading brands, Google's Chief Business Officer, Phillip Schindler, promised that the company would review its advertising tools and introduce improved safeguards. With news of its agreement with comScore, it would appear that Google could be living up to its promise, especially after it also announced improvements to Programmatic Guaranteed on its DoubleClick AdExchange platform. As reported by the Drum, Google said that advertisers, by using Programmatic Guaranteed with audience lists, can target or exclude their own audience lists and "secure guaranteed access to preferred publisher inventory while minimizing media waste". Google also said its latest update would enable publishers to better forecast the inventory they can compare with advertisers' lists, and then guarantee that they are serving ads only to the buyer's target audience.

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares133 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu have led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on-board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks. Carson Saldanha ?` Shawn Spring I'm hoping this and Nick Jr (for the kiddos) comes sooner rather than later! freshprince_87 I hope they add it soon Lateef Alabi-Oki I think the nailed the user interface.

Tucker Sferro $35 is outrageous. You might as well jest get cable. Jacob Fulbright After you add in YouTube Red, Netflix, Hulu (or the ad-free premium Hulu), HBO GO, etc., yeah, cable isn't looking so bad anymore. Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams.

Name: Subject: Message: Google releases Android Things Developer Preview 3 Newsby Dan Bartram7 hours ago 3 130 10 Google has released the third developer preview of Android Things, the company’s platform that offers APIs to developers to help them build smart devices. Leveraging Android Things, developers can develop for Internet of Things and take advantage of regular updates, Google services, and most importantly, a secure platform. The Developer Preview 3 introduces a few enhancements to improve the features available to developers. See also: What is Android Things? – Gary explains January 13, 2017 As of Developer Preview 3, Android Things now supports all Android Bluetooth APIs for android.bluetooth and android.bluetooth.le packages across all supported devices. The improvements mean that developers can leverage Bluetooth as if it were an Android smartphone enabling the full range of Bluetooth capabilities. In addition, USB Host Support has been added to Android Things to provide the same functionality that has been part of Android since version 3.1. USB Host allows a regular user space application to communicate with USB devices without root privileges or support needed from the Linux kernel. The introduction of these two features in Developer Preview 3 bridges the gap yet further towards integrating the functionality we all know and love in Android into Internet of Things. With IoT devices quickly finding a place in everyone’s home, it’s good to see Google help provide a standardized platform to develop on that will hopefully improve accessibility and interoperability. To download images for Developer Preview 3, you can visit the Android Things download page and also join Google’s IoT Developers Community on Google+ to connect with others interested in Android Things.

Weiss EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Amazon is already a huge player in e-commerce and the cloud. Does it also want to join the productivity suite wars against Microsoft?  Related Media Microsoft updates the Office 365 Enterprise K1 plan to add services for frontline employees Microsoft Expands Office 365 Profiles; Shows the Value in the First Release Program Microsoft Teams Reaches General Availability Around the Globe for Office 365 Commercial Subscribers Advertisement Amazon may be looking to expand beyond its huge and powerful music and video services, e-commerce and cloud service provider businesses to take on Microsoft in an entirely new direction by creating its own version of the Microsoft Office productivity suite. Rumors about such a development have been swirling for several months, according to a February report by The Information, which said that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been "working on upgrades to its WorkMail email-calendar app and its WorkDocs file storage-collaboration app to make them more attractive to corporate customers," according to details provided anonymously by two people who do business with Amazon. "AWS has also told some large corporate customers it's considering bundling these apps with its recently launched Chime video conferencing apps into a new productivity app suite that will compete with Google G Suite and Microsoft Office 365," a source who allegedly had been briefed on the plans told The Information. Amazon did not respond to several email inquiries from ITPro.com seeking comments about its potential plans for an office competitor in the marketplace that would take on Microsoft, Google, LibreOffice and others. Several IT analysts, however, said that while they are generally skeptical about such plans by Amazon, it would at least be possible that the company would take such a leap into another new direction. "I've heard rumors but initially discounted them," Charles King, principal analyst for research firm, Pund-IT, told ITPro.com in an email reply. "The list of challengers to Microsoft Office is pretty long but their results have been anything but pretty. Entering the fray would be difficult for anyone, including Amazon, but the company has a history of pursuing counter-intuitive strategies." King said he could imagine Amazon at least considering the idea of moving into the office suite marketplace as competition in cloud computing stiffens and AWS growth appears to be reaching a plateau. "The market leverage that Microsoft and Google enjoy due to their respective productivity suites must seem extremely attractive," wrote King. "With few other 'magic bullets' on the horizon, Amazon's management may have decided that investing in offerings analogous to Microsoft's and Google's may be the only way it can fully compete against them." A key problem for Amazon, though, is that if it does decide to move forward on such plans, "its starting point will be far behind Google and Microsoft – in a different Zip code, practically speaking," wrote King. "Microsoft Office has a long history and deep penetration with businesses, and Microsoft has done a terrific job of using its Azure cloud service to evolve Office solutions and extend their value. Google's cost-efficient Docs offerings have strengthened the company's Chrome OS and Chromebook solutions, enabling Google to establish a formidable presence among thrifty educators and in classrooms." At the same time, however, King said he wouldn't count Amazon out entirely. "I never say never – Google, after all, occupies a market position in education that Apple used to command. But I believe that if Amazon enters the market, the road ahead will be difficult, at best." Another analyst, Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group, calls the rumors "a bit of a stretch," even for Amazon, but that he can see some possible scenarios for such thinking inside the company. "Microsoft's offering has been pretty static and it doesn't even conform to Windows app guidelines with regard to how it works," while Google largely provides a cheaper version of Office, wrote Enderle. "That suggests that there is an opportunity for someone of scale to create a product that does for productivity what Echo did for music in the home," he said. "Amazon employs a lot of ex-Microsoft folks so it is likely there are a core group of folks who may have been frustrated that Microsoft didn't allow them to do what they thought needed to be done" and who could be behind the efforts, said Enderle.   Amazon does like to step into areas where there is opportunity due to an unwillingness for existing firms to challenge the status quo and advance, Enderle added. "AWS surprised IBM, Echo surprised Apple, and their drone delivery efforts, even though not implemented yet, have scared the hell out of Fed Ex and UPS," he said. "This could be their way of showcasing what Microsoft should have done."   Dan Olds, principal analyst with Gabriel Consulting Group, called the Amazon office suite rumors "kind of interesting in a stupid way." Since the rumors surfaced back in February, they have apparently not received lots of attention in the IT industry, Olds told ITPro.com. "I don't give this an awful lot of credence myself because this doesn't make much sense for Amazon to do that unless they have a lot of people with a lot of time on their hands. Amazon should stick to selling Microsoft Office rather than try to compete with it." Building a competing product, especially having to try to catch up with existing competitors, is something that would be a huge challenge for Amazon, he said. "This isn't in their wheelhouse. This is software that people depend on and it takes a lot of design work and upkeep to keep it useful. I don't know what makes them think they can do a better job."

The Google Home device.(Facebook) The Scroll OK, Google: Where’s the Afikoman? Now you can lean on the Silicon Valley giant for answers to your most pressing Passover questions By Gabriela Geselowitz The Scroll OK, Google: Where’s the Afikoman? Now you can lean on the Silicon Valley giant for answers to your most pressing Passover questions By Gabriela Geselowitz April 6, 2017 • 2:19 PM As in DVDs and movies, hidden interactive features in electronics are called “Easter eggs,” but that feels rather blasphemous given that this one is about the Jewish holiday that Easter hangs around. We’re talking about Passover, of course. Turns out, the Google Assistant/Home/cylindrical robot-thing has actually been programmed with canned responses for many Jewish holidays. If you wish it a happy Purim, for instance, it will wish you one back, maybe even with a reference to traditions associated with the celebration. But this Google contraption around the month of Nisan is extra fun. If you have Google Home or Google Assistant (called Allo and accessible on eligible Android phones), you can have a bit of fun as you prep for Pesach. First of all, you can ask it to help you search for chametz. You may get sassy responses and an obvious but helpful reminder—”Did you check the pantry?” or “You might want to clean out the cookie jar.” Plus, you can also ask for tips on how to find the afikoman! If you don’t use electronics on holidays, you’ll have to ask in advance (“Find the Afikoman!” will work fine). Its answer may be a bit… creative (think: bubbe and zayde). The device can’t scan your home for the missing matzo (or traces of forbidden bread), but if it could, would Google really admit it to you?  They have enough of your private information as it is. No word on if the Google Assistant knows the answers to why this night is different from all other nights, but if it doesn’t, surely it’s only a matter of time.

Reporter 100 Words Shareworthy Showcase Media Television Print Out of Home Digital Below The Line Radio Media Briefs Directories Case Studies Latest Advertising Marketing Media Digital Events Online Videos Google takes on Apple in India with music streaming service at Rs 89/month By Raghu Krishnan , Business Standard, Bengaluru | In Digital | April 07, 2017 The Silicon Valley giant's move is a third lower than Apple's subscription fee of Rs 120. Following in the footsteps of US-based iPhone maker Apple, technology giant Google has launched its subscription-based music streaming service in India - a move that aims to build loyalty among the subscribers to remain in its ecosystem, and take on local rivals like Gaana and Saavn. The multinational company's move to charge a monthly subscription for Google Play Music also underscores a shift, that Indian customers are likely to pay for a service than consume it with advertisements. Google Play Music, launched on Wednesday, is priced at Rs 89 a month, compared to Rs 120 for Apple Music. Apple, however, has a student plan at Rs 60 a month, which looks to engage the first-time users. "With Google Play Music subscription, Indian subscribers can listen to their favourite music across a variety of languages, including Hindi, English, Tamil and more. This music can be accessed from any device with your Google Account," said Elias Roman, lead product manager, Google Play Music, in a statement. "To make the experience deeply personalised, we've plugged into Google's understanding of context and machine learning to recommend the right music at the right moment based on each listener's preference, place and activity," said Roman. Google - which dominates India's internet market as most users come online on smartphones that run on its Android platform - is keen to protect its turf. Its music service is also available on Apple's iOS platform and on desktop computers, suggesting an ongoing battle between the two technology giants for dominance in the Indian market. Indian music streaming services Gaana and Saavn have a paid subscription model but they also earn revenue by offering free streaming of music supported with advertisements. Both firms have huge libraries of local music. Apple and Google are dipping into their collection of international music to tap users. Google's push with its music service in India comes in view of Apple's plan to use services as a bait to lure local users ahead of its big expansion in the country. Apple is offering its music services on Android devices, giving it a taste of its ecosystem. It is locally assembling its affordable iPhone SE in the country, which it wants to position as an aspirational smartphone for young Indian users. Apple has also begun streaming its music on the entertainment platform of cab aggregator Ola and reach out to its over 25 million customers.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 294 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares436 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Middlefinger Sorry I meant LP. Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? YaKillaCJ Updates do actually roll out to Xiaomi devices. This means that they also get security patches. Also across a wide variety of devices. mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. Middlefinger Except that you haven't demonstrated why im a hypocrite, at all. whispy_snippet I don't have to. You're doing it all by yourself. Middlefinger Nope, dont see anything hypocritical here. Not fitting your narrative doesn't equal hypocritical you know.. whispy_snippet "Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.." Do you have any idea how stupid this looks? Middlefinger Well Tizen isn't even theirs, you know that right? Like Android sort of was/is its open source, developed by the Linux Foundation. Samsung is a member and is using it. Its not as commonly used and isnt as well developed as Android, but it is at least independent of Googles dictatorship. I still see no hypocrisy there, i guess you dont know what the word actually means. whispy_snippet Geez, you're like Tim. Middlefinger So you couldn't argue, so used a straw man. Got it. whispy_snippet No, I'm wasting my energy on someone too egotistic and deluded to accept rhyme or reason. You're not just a hypocrite Samsung shill, you're deliberately obtuse and tedious to interact with. You're a waste of time. Middlefinger Again, no , i just dont agree with you. There is clear anti-samsung bias on here, from both the commenters and the contributors, even if its often covered by the begrudging acceptance that they make the best products. You keep thinking im a Samsung shill if you like, and wasting your time commenting based on that erroneous position. I will just carry on telling it as I see it, when Google does bad and Samsung does bad. whispy_snippet "even if its often covered by the begrudging acceptance that they make the best products." Perfect. Middlefinger Ill bite. Who makes better? HTC, nope. Sony? Niche at best, stale design. LG, floundering, but the G6 is at least good. OnePlus, oh please. Moto/Lenovo hahahaa. Pixel? Only if you are a SJW for AOSP. Huawei/ZTE etc. Not really, the hardware is lacking, the software often poor, the quality is superficial. Fact is the Galaxy S at least is clearly the best device. Its the most sorted and reliable, has the best hardware, the best design, the best software (desite what said AOSP fanboys think). whispy_snippet Game, set and match. Middlefinger OK so you aren't going to argue, that's fine, I guess you cant. People who wont state their position are unsure of it, you dont want to state your alternative best because you know it will get shot down. I guess this IS a waste of time. Your Blocked.. whispy_snippet Bye Tim II. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? Middlefinger I guess you know the history of Android, right? Its not originally Googles, and much of the code in current Android is community based, so again, not Google. M. Luciano You're out of your element Donnie. Middlefinger The only thing that bothers me here is the torrent of apologists and fanboys. Its hard to battle 10+ delusional people all at once. Nothing i said wasn't true, and yet again someone is arguing without providing any actual argument. M. Luciano Yeah that was because you didn't address my point and brought up something totally different that just sounds tangentially related, yet isn't. The issue is that Samsung is woefully ignorant of security best practices and the same cannot be said of Google, who is providing Samsung with the vast majority of their Android security related code. Yes, some of it comes from AOSP, but most of it comes from Google, regardless of whether or not they invented the OS. Middlefinger Tizen isnt a samsung OS, its open source. Its behind Android yes, but its improving as you can see if you actually look. Samsungs mistake might be using it at all, but it was kind of forced to do something because for the uses Samsung has for Tizen (its watches mainly), Android is god awful. Android was a terrible mess at the start to, and while Tizen isnt new, its got nothing like the activity Android gets. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ? Middlefinger But Tizen isnt Samsungs, its developed by the Linux Foundation and is open source. Samsung might use it, and help develop it, but its not their creation. At this point its just in a position that Android was maybe 8 years ago. Samsung is using it because its free of Googles controlling. JG This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places Why not error on the side of caution, encrypt everything!

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares133 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu have led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on-board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks. Carson Saldanha ?` Shawn Spring I'm hoping this and Nick Jr (for the kiddos) comes sooner rather than later! freshprince_87 I hope they add it soon Lateef Alabi-Oki I think the nailed the user interface.

Tucker Sferro $35 is outrageous. You might as well jest get cable. Jacob Fulbright After you add in YouTube Red, Netflix, Hulu (or the ad-free premium Hulu), HBO GO, etc., yeah, cable isn't looking so bad anymore. Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams.

Pixel, the first phone from Google, has come up with a new campaign, '#DayWithPixel', featuring Mrs. Funnybones, Twinkle Khanna. Google Pixel was launched last year in October. Priced between 57 and 75,000, it comes with the Google Assistant, Google Duo for easy voice calling, USB-C charger that gives up to seven hours of battery life in 15 minutes, unlimited storage with Google Photos and the 'highest-rated smartphone camera ever'. Conceptualised by Lowe Lintas Delhi, the campaign depicts how Google Pixel is Khanna's perfect and helpful daily companion through a candid portrayal of a day in her life. Khanna, who began her professional journey as a Bollywood actor, has carved out quite a niche for herself over the past couple of years as a popular author and columnist. A passionate interior designer, she is also an online celeb of sorts. No prizes for guessing where I have landed today since every restaurant around me proudly states their state:) #tikkafreak #DayWithPixel pic.twitter.com/ZnSMDULEHZ— Twinkle Khanna (@mrsfunnybones) April 6, 2017 This and probably her Twitter Bio which goes "A bona fide member of an ambiguous tribe of the new age Indian woman; heavily armed with the weapons of my choice: Google and lame jokes," is what got Google interested in her. The video begins with the Google Assistant taking a selfie for Khanna, as she reiterates, "all she needs to get through her day is Google (Pixel, to be precise) and lame jokes." In the close to two-minute-long video, Mrs. Funnybones can be seen juggling various roles and interests with Google Pixel by her side. Khanna rose to popularity with the success of her first book, 'Mrs Funnybones' which sold over one hundred thousand copies making her India's highest-selling female writer of 2015 (NDTV). The book also won her the Crossword Book Award 2016. Her second book, 'The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad' is a collection of stories published by Juggernaut Books. She won the 'India Today Woman Writer of the Year Award' at the India Today Woman Summit and Awards held on March 24. Recently, she was appointed the new face of L'Oreal Professionnel India. Khanna has also endorsed real estate brand Amara, AskMe.com and Micromax Q5 Bling in the past. Just as I was about to begin sprouting 50 shades of grey, I am rather glad I am sporting 50 shades of L'Or�al instead:) #lorealproindia #iha https://t.co/snILlShWIn— Twinkle Khanna (@mrsfunnybones) March 2, 2017 Known for her witty tweets and trenchant columns on a range of subjects, she recently created a buzz with her article on sexual harassment at workplaces in the context of TVF's Arunabh Kumar controversy. Kumar had in an interview to a leading daily said, "I am a heterosexual single man and when I find a woman sexy, I tell her she is sexy. I compliment women, is that wrong?", to which Mrs. Funnybones retorted, "Sexy' is an acceptable compliment within a work environment only if she is a stripper and you are her pimp trying to boost her confidence before she takes the stage." This exchange of words was followed by her piece, 'Hey, corner office frog, keep that sticky tongue to yourself' in the Times of India blogs. Review According to Dinesh Swamy, senior creative director, SapientRazorfish India, it was an intelligent decision on the brand's part to focus on the key feature of Google Assistant considering the way technology has brought great ease to one's hectic lifestyle. "The campaign captures the overarching message of the brand well. A simple format, show and tell always works well. For this campaign, weaving in a simple story of a day in Mrs. Funnybones' life with a well-placed demonstration of Pixel's features, is a wonderful narrative to connect with the target audience. It amplifies the impact of the campaign," he says. Swamy, however, finds the execution slightly lacklustre, with no clear high point in the film. It could have been infused with more of Mrs. Funnybones' humour to add her signature touch to the campaign. Chandrashekhar Mhaskar, vice president, digital creative and services division, Isobar India, seems unimpressed with the idea which he says has been done-to-death. "People who own Android phones are aware of the Google Assistant. If this campaign is about Google Pixel, they should have harped on the special features of the phone and how it makes a difference to people's lives. Google is known to be innovative in their products and services. This is far from innovative. A big let-down." he states. Questioning the choice of Twinkle Khanna for the campaign, he notes, "Her image doesn't correlate to a Mrs. Funnybones. She hasn't leveraged her possible comic image. It could have very well been '#DayWithPixel in Mr/Mrs. XYZ's life'." 14SHARES Follow Ashee Sharma Search Tags Lowe Lintas Google Twinkle Khanna Google Pixel Advertising © 2017 afaqs!     Related Articles afaqs!

Whether its brand new or you’re just looking for something different. With nearly 2.8 million apps on the Google Play Store, finding the best ones can be a challenge. Below we’ve round up our favorite Android apps of all kinds. These will help with productivity, let you have fun, play games and lose weight. Or just be entertained for hours on end. While some of these apps may cost a few dollars or have in-app purchases, most of them are completely free. That said, usually paid apps deliver a better experience, and are worth the small price. Whether this is your first Android, or you’ve had them for years, these are the best Android apps you should install. We have a little of something for everyone. Best Android Apps Android is built to support many different devices of all shapes, sizes and manufacturers. The apps are too. Which means our list will work whether you have the latest Galaxy S7 with Android 7.0 Nougat, or an old tablet with Android 4.4 Kit. Most are completely backwards compatible. That said, select games and other intensive apps may require a more modern device. Also, apps are optimized for small screen Android devices, to the biggest of 10-inch tablets. Although most are designed with smartphones in mind. The tablet app selection isn’t the biggest, but most apps still work just fine on tablets of any size. In the end, any and all of these apps will deliver a great experience, are fun games, or will keep you entertained for hours. We have a huge list below of the best Android apps broken down by category. Then, continue reading for additional details and links to download many of our favorites. It’s a big list, so lets get started. Best Android Racing Games Best First Person Shooter Games for Android Best Twitter Apps for Android Best Music Player Apps Best Budget Saving Apps – or Best Money Making Apps Best Password Manager Apps for Android Best Android Alarm Clock Apps Best Keyboards for Android Best Daydream VR Apps & Games Best Offline (No WiFi) Android Games – or Best Android Games to Play at Work Best Bible Study Apps Best Fighting Games for Android Best Math Apps Best Fitness Apps Best Photo Editing Apps Additionally, there are some extremely exciting games coming in 2017. Keep your eye on that list as they’re released. Many of those will be added to our best apps list once available, and look to be some of the best we’ve ever seen. My Daily Android Apps Here are the Android apps that I use the most, or somewhat frequently. I keep many of these on my home screens or in the dock, and have folders full of my favorites. Like a folder full of video streaming apps, social, and games. I’ll start with what I consider my essential apps, then breakout into more categories below. Google Play Music – With Google Play Music storing up to 20,000 of my own songs, and an All Access subscription of endless music, this is always on my first home screen. Reddit is Fun – This is one of the best Android apps for Reddit users due to all the features and the clean design. I use it over the official Reddit app, or can also recommend Reddit Flow. Downloads – I’m always downloading files, images, GIFs, memes and more, so keeping the downloads folder in eyes view is important to me. Netflix – There isn’t much to say here. Watch thousands of movies, TV series, documentaries and more with Netflix. Clash Royale – With millions of players worldwide on both Android and iOS, Clash Royale is one of the most popular (and addicting) games available. I used to be a die-hard Clash of Clans player, but Royale has taken over its spot. Instagram – It’s popular for many reasons, but I love the ease of use and all the filters to bring my photos to life with Instagram. Samsung Pay – If you haven’t tried it I’d strongly recommend using Samsung Pay if you have a Galaxy smartphone. Easy mobile payments at almost 95% of stores throughout the US. It’s far better than Apple Pay, or Android Pay and is backwards compatible with old terminals too. It works everywhere. Google Maps – If you need directions, navigation instructions, or are looking for a nearby place nothing beats Google Maps. Bank of America – Everyone has a different app for their bank, but I keep my banking app front and center so I can check funds, transfer payments and more with ease. Venmo is a good app too, for easily sending and receiving money from friends and family. Textra SMS – The amount of 3rd party text messaging apps for Android is getting out of hand. However, Textra is one of the best I’ve found, uses material design, has plenty of customization, and is the cleanest, sleekest, and fastest app I’ve used to date. Device Manager – If you ever lose your phone, whether that be at home in the couch or while you’re out and about, you’ll want to have Device Manager installed. It’s like Find my iPhone. You can lock it, make it ring, or wipe all data to prevent info getting in the wrong hands from theft. SoundHound – Music discovery and lyrics is easier than ever before thanks to SoundHound. I have a one-click widget to instantly find more info about a song that I use all the time. And my daughter loves the live lyrics. Slack – If you work on a team or in a small office forget the hassles of email for internal communication and switch to Slack. You’ll love it. MyFitnessPal – MyFitnessPal is one of the best weight loss apps around with hundreds of thousands of happy users. Get in shape for the summer months by using it. LastPass – Use a super difficult to guess and long password, and let LastPass remember the rest for anything and everything you do. Only one password for everything. It even has fingerprint sign-in. Read our LastPass review. WatchESPN – We mention this again below, but it’s bar far one of the best Android apps and something I use all year long. WatchESPN always has a spot on my home screen. Falcon Pro – Falcon Pro is easily my favorite Twitter client for Android, but it can’t be used by most thanks to a dumb token limit set by Twitter. Try the new Falcon Pro 3, or Robird which are both excellent. Many enjoy Talon, too. Best Entertainment Apps Everyone is different when it comes to what they use for entertainment, and many just stick to YouTube. However, these are some of the best apps to keep you entertained. Sling TV – Just $20 a month for live TV streamed right over the internet, including sports and NFL Network. Add bundles to get more channels (only the good ones) and ditch cable. I use this daily. Hulu Plus – This is my go to app for watching TV shows on Android. Although it offers a wide range of shows I mostly watch the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on it. HBO Go – When I want to watch Game of Thrones or old Entourage episodes on the go I use the HBO Go app. It’s also great for access to comedy specials that are easy to watch in small blocks while on the go. Stream it to the bigscreen with Google Chromecast. Netflix – Netflix, it has almost everything. Need I say more? How about that House of Cards? WatchESPN – When I need to catch an NCAA Football game or enjoy some sports, news, highlights and more, I sign into WatchESPN through Cox and enjoy everything it has to offer. ESPN Radio – When I can’t watch I’ll use the ESPN Radio app to listen to games and other programs. Perfect for listening to sports while driving or hitting the gym. Showtime Anytime – The Showtime app isn’t the best, but works great on smartphones or tablets, and even the Amazon Fire TV or Stick. iFunny – If you want the latest funny photos, trending jokes, memes, GIF’s and more iFunny is like Reddit and full of humor. Same goes for The Chive app. NFL Mobile – I no longer have Verizon so NFL Mobile is somewhat limited, but it’s the #1 way to watch NFL Football on Android. By far. DirecTV – I can watch live TV on Android using my DirecTV subscription. I don’t get all of my channels, but there are enough great options. It works good on tablets too, or use the Cox Contour app. Xbox One SmartGlass – With this app I can connect to my Xbox to change the game I am playing, enter in text and see and respond to messages without leaving a game. Yahoo Fantasy  – You can use this app to track almost any thing you need to stay on top of your fantasy sports team. Bleacher Report is also an awesome app for up to the second news on Sports. Amazon Prime Video – Last but not least, Amazon Prime members can use this to watch free streaming video on Android devices including movies and TV shows without an additional subscription. Best Android Games Our lists above went over some of the best games for Android by category. However, if I had to choose a few of them for one big list, these would be them. At least for me. Clash of Clans – With millions of players worldwide on both Android and iOS, Clash of Clans is one of the most popular (and addicting) games available on mobile, and I play it way more than I should. So much my girlfriend rolls her eyes each time she hears the launch intro song. RipTide GP2 – This water racing game shows excellent graphics, keeps me entertained for hours, and shows just how good gaming can be on Android. Asphalt 8 – Asphalt 8: Airborne is the eighth release in a series of the best racing games for Android, period. Flockers – Flockers is like old school Lemmings, but for the 21st century. It’s fun, addicting, and very challenging. NFL Kicker – For some reason NFL Kicker is always one of my favorite games while on a flight, or needing a casual game to enjoy. I play it for hours, and pass it off to friends to try (and fail) to beat my high score. Trivia Crack – If you want to battle your friends in some good old fashion Trivia, this award winning game is one of my all time favorites. It keeps getting better and better, and integration with iOS and Facebook friends makes it a must. Like Words With Friends, you can play it for hours, or weeks, or months. Same goes for SongPop. Subway Surfers – Those looking for a casual and fun game similar to Temple Run, try Subway Surfers. It’s free. Alto’s Adventure – Jump and ski your way to the bottom of a never-ending mountain as you collect llamas, run from village elders and collect power ups. Agar.io – Control growing circle that expands as it absorbs smaller circles until you are the biggest blob on the board. Simple, but addicting. This game won tons of awards. Fallout Shelter – Manage resources and grow your shelter in this Fallout game that is a perfect fit for Android phones. Fun and frustrating at the same time as you balance inhabitants and resources. Minecraft: Pocket Edition – It really needs no introduction. Minecraft Pocket edition brings the world of building and exploration to mobile devices. There are some mods too, and it works great on any and all Android devices. Pokemon GO – Yes, it has to be on this list. For a while there in 2016 Pokemon GO literally took over the world, parks, business and more. It’s still fun and gets lots of updates. Catch Em All! Or, download some emulators and enjoy old school classics on Android. Many of them work great with a bluetooth game controller. Best Shopping Apps I do most my shopping online these days, and you’ll probably want at least a few of the apps below to get all your shopping done with ease. Amazon –  Amazon has one of the biggest and best selections around, not to mention 2-day free shipping with Amazon Prime can’t be beat. It’s my go to app. I wonder how much money I’ve spent at Amazon. That should be listed somewhere. eBay – I don’t use eBay as much as I did five years ago, but it still has plenty of stuff you otherwise can’t find elsewhere. I still browse occasionally, and use PayPal for my purchases. But seller fees keep me from selling anything. CPro for Craigslist – Craigslist is one of my favorite sites for shopping, but use caution and watch out for scams. I always meet buyers or sellers at a gas station or retail store. Better safe than sorry. Best Buy  – The Best Buy app show current specials, gaming information and rewards for My Best Buy. PayPal – I use the PayPal app to check on balances for purchases I make online, and to check incoming payments for various projects. This is also a place to see receipts for PayPal debit card purchases. A similar app for sending money is called Venmo, and many love it. Meh Notifier – Meh.com is one of my favorite sites. Like Woot.com back in the day, Meh.com has one sale a day that’s usually pretty good. And don’t forget about Two for Tuesdays. I’ve bought over 20 things from this darn site in the last 8 months. The app is decent, but I’d just go to the site as it has an excellent mobile layout. Gas Buddy – Find the cheapest gas near you and get an alert when gas prices are set to go up so that you can fill up before the price changes. Starbucks – With the mobile ordering option skip lines and get that overpriced coffee even faster. They do have some good drinks, and a nice points system for free drinks. OpenTable – This is the fastest way to get a reservation at a restaurant. Forget calling and checking multiple times over the phone and checking with your group. See what is open and then book it without making a call. Flixster – This could be in entertainment, but I use it to browse and buy my movie tickets. Flixster has an awesome design, movie previews, reviews and rating, and lets you buy tickets right in the app. Including Fandango ones. Best Social Apps These days social apps and social networks run the internet, and you’ll want to have some of the best apps available to keep in touch with friends, family, or all those funny GIF’s or memes floating around. Twitter – The stock Twitter app is fine for most, but I prefer Falcon Pro, or Talon is a good choice too. Facebook – We can’t forget about Facebook to keep in touch with friends or family, or to see every ridiculous post that one friend makes on an hourly basis. Facebook Messenger – Facebook’s Messenger app keeps getting better and better. From messages, calling, emoji’s, voice messages and more. Keep in touch with this SMS replacement app. It also is taking on Snapchat and Instagram lately, so give it another try. Instagram – Again, Instagram has one of the best list of features to fine tune photos, add filters, and create “art” from photos, or at least that’s what I’m told. Also try Prisma, it isn’t a social site, but has beautiful filters better than the IG. Snapchat – If you’ve never used it, Snapchat allow for fast and easy communication with friends. Add a caption and hit send, and the image deletes itself for security reasons. Use it as you see fit. Untappd – This is a social network for beer lovers that can help you find new beers to try and enjoy. I’ve recently started brewing my own. TapaTalk – If you’re on a forum for a passion, interest, hobby, or like talking about your truck with other truck enthusiast, Tapatalk is one of the best forum apps. Signal – Apple users have iMessage, and those on Android who want to send messages privately and secure, should use this app. It’s one of the best around. Or you could attempt to get friends on Google Allo. Android Apps You’ll Love We’ve already gone over some of the most important and best apps, but here are a few more you’ll find useful and end up loving. Dropbox – Although Google Drive is useful, Dropbox is the could storage service I use most. This is how I move files, photos, ringtones and screenshots between devices. And I have a huge collection of GIF’s and funny photos making fun of the Bears or Patriots. ES File Explorer – File explorers are extremely useful to manage and find important things or documents. I recently started using Astro, but there are plenty of good options. Yelp – Everyone knows about Yelp, but there are millions that don’t take advantage of this tool to find stores, places to eat, and more in your neighborhood or city. Groupon – Everyone likes saving money, finding good deals, or doing fun things you never knew were available in your town. I’ve gone bowling, horseback riding, done Archery and more all at huge discounts thanks to Groupon. One day I’ll use a coupon for a week getaway vacation to Italy. Google Opinion Rewards – Speaking of money, want to earn up to $100 a year just by answering a quick survey every few days. It usually takes about 5-10 seconds, and you’re all done. Enable location, answer questions and get paid. I’ve earned over $150 with Google Opinion Rewards. You can too. I spend it on Clash Royale, movies and music.

UPS – With UPS My Choice and this app I can see when packages will come and even change delivery options if I need to. Fedex – With this app and registration with FedEx I can see all FedEx packages coming to my house from Ground and Express in one place. Even when I don’t have a tracking number. ParcelTrack – If you get a lot of packages or delivers from multiple shipping companies, you’ll absolutely love ParcelTrack. It tells me where everything is, when it’s coming, delays and more. Tiny Scanner – Use this quickly scan in a document without a scanner. The results are amazing and you would swear that it came from a full size scanner in an office.

Push Bullet – Have you ever wanted to send and receive your text messages on a computer or PC. Push Bullet does that and much more. Transfer files, manage images or send messages through your phone on a PC. Smart Tools – Have you ever needed a ruler, compass, flashlight or even a bubble level while doing things?

We hope these great apps help you do more on your Android. 4 Responses 03/20/2017 Suraj Padmasali Reply Awesome list of apps! But I think you forget to add Spotify app. By using this app, you get a better experience than Google play music. It’s one of the best-made apps in my opinion. 03/22/2017 Cory Gunther Reply Yeah it certainly needs to be in the list. It’s in our best music apps roundup listed in the post, but I must have missed that for the entertainment or my daily apps section. I use it and Google Music both, daily. Thanks! 03/30/2017 Steve Nordquist Reply Yeah! An article with the stuff in it! Cool. Can’t believe you didn’t list a sound processing music or singing app. Still debating whether you’d notice handling changes from run-flat goop in your tires on the day of, Apr. 1. Full set of GiTS vinyl shells seems like over-doing… 04/06/2017 CDM Reply The craigslist app Cpro For Craigslist no longer works. Craigslist refused to renew the license for Cpro in 2016, so they created their own marketplace. The app is now called Cpro Marketplace, and it does not host ANY craigslist listings. Super disappointing. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

The company, which produces and distributes adult videos optimized for virtual reality headsets, told Variety this week that it has seen 40 percent of its usage come from Gear VR this year. That’s close to double the usage of the next-most-popular headset, which happens to be Google Cardboard with 23 percent. Oculus Rift and HTC Vive together accounted for 25 percent of all video downloads since the beginning of the year, and PlayStation VR made up 9 percent. Google’s Daydream VR headset barely registered in the stats of the company, accounting for just 3 percent of all downloads. Why does this matter? Most VR headset manufacturers have kept mum on sales and usage data, making it challenging to get a sense of how popular each platform is. Samsung said in January that it has shipped more than 5 million headsets, and Sony revealed in February that consumers had bought close to one million PSVR devices. HTC, Google Oculus haven’t released any official sales data for their devices. Even the sales numbers from Samsung and Sony don’t tell us much about actual usage. That’s especially true for the Gear VR, which Samsung at times has given away for free, leading some critics to assume that the headsets would simply collect dust. BadoinkVR’s data suggest that this is not true at all. The company offers its paying subscribers different file versions for each device. Thanks to these downloads, Badoink has a pretty good idea what its users are relying on for their 360-degree adult entertainment. Granted, using data from a single adult video provider isn’t a perfect way to assess the health of the entire VR industry. But the harsh discrepancy between Gear VR and Daydream should be a cause of concern for Google, and anyone developing for the company’s Daydream platform. The fact that Gear VR got more than 13 times as much usage as Daydream suggests that Google still has a long way to go before Daydream can compete with some of the other VR platforms.

YouTube TV hands-on: Google's off to a good start Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/06 3:13pm PDTApr 6, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares133 Applications Google News Reviews Videos The expansion of services like Netflix and Hulu have led to fewer people subscribing to traditional cable. Still, there are some things you can't get with those streaming services, most notably live TV feeds. That's what Google aims to offer with YouTube TV. Google announced the service a few months ago, and it went live in a handful of cities yesterday. I haven't had a cable subscription in years, so I was anxious to try it out. YouTube TV seems like an excellent start, but there are definitely some pain points. The Basics YouTube TV is currently only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It will run you $35 per month and includes access to about 40 channels of live streaming TV. That includes local channels like Fox, CBS, and so on. The focus on live local channels is why the rollout is regional—Google has to get the broadcasters on-board with YouTube TV in each market. There's a reasonably good selection of channels including all the locals, NatGeo, ESPN, Disney, FX, USA, SyFy, and more. There are no Viacom channels like Comedy Central or MTV, which is not unexpected. Viacom is notoriously protective of its content. There are also limited options for premium content—it's just Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month?!). No HBO, which is a big boo. YouTube TV is available via the Android (or iOS) app, as well in your desktop web browser. There is not currently a client for Android TV, which strikes me as profoundly odd. There is, however, Chromecast support for getting the stream onto a bigger screen. Although, not everyone is cool with using their phone as a remote control all the time. You can watch live streams of all the included channels, and there's some on-demand content too. If you can't catch something live, you can set up series recordings in YouTube TV. All the content you record is saved online, and you can record as much as you want. How can it be unlimited? The recordings expire after nine months. Still, PlayStation Vue removes things after 28 days, and Sling TV limits you to 50GB of space. Living with YouTube TV I've mostly been using YouTube TV on Android, and the app is nice overall. The interface is clean, with just three tabs in the main interface and heavy use of animated thumbnails. Across the top of the app are tabs for Library, Home, and Live. The Home tab is basically a list of suggestions for things you might want to watch or record—it even shows you what's most popular right now. The "popular" live carousel at the top is the first place you'll see YouTube TV's live thumbnails. The channel previews play (no sound, thankfully) as you scroll through. It's like flipping channels on your TV. Below that are several lists of suggestions, including a few that push sports. Over in the Live tab, it's again like flipping channels. You scroll vertically through the channel list, and each one has a live thumbnail when it's selected. Sound doesn't kick in until you tap on a channel to watch it. I'm impressed with how smooth this interface runs with all the live thumbnails. The streams were noticeably jerky on the LG G6, but everything runs fine on the Mate 9 and Pixel. I'm not sure what's up with the inconsistency there, but it's usually a very snappy app. The streams are 720p for most channels, so they don't look flawless when casting to a TV (some are 1080p). No one I've showed it to thought the video (720p or 1080p) looked bad, though. Video quality is great on the device and good enough when casting to a Shield TV or a second gen Chromecast. I don't have a first gen dongle around to test anymore, but apparently the app warns you of possible performance issues there. Audio playback will continue in the background while you do other things in the app, but it stops when you leave it (the regular YouTube app has background play for Red subscribers). That's probably not a huge deal for TV, but it would still be nice to have. A floating pop-out player would be better, though. Throughout the app you'll see the "plus" button to add a series or movie to your library. Doing so will record any new instances of the content whenever it airs on TV. You can simply add anything that looks interesting to your library because the storage is unlimited. Recordings can be started after a program begins, but it won't actually be available in your library until it's over. Recordings that you've scheduled ahead of time will let you scrub back to the beginning if you want to watch live, which is a great feature to have. And yes, you can skip commercials in recorded content. The Library tab is split up into shows, movies, sports, and events. There's also a section that shows all your scheduled recordings, including those that are in progress. There's some on-demand content available in YouTube TV, which is confusingly merged with your recordings. The app doesn't really differentiate between the two when you are subscribed to a show—you just have a details page with a list of all available episodes. In addition, there are still restrictions on how many on-demand episodes are available from one rights holder to the next. You can end up with a patchwork of available streams. I should also note that some of the on-demand content has ads; mostly movies with pre-roll ads. The desktop interface is slick too.  Account management and value YouTube TV is only in a few markets right now, and that limits what you can do even if you live in one of those places. Let's say you live in Chicago. YouTube TV streams you all your local channels, lets you set recordings, and watch them at any time. If you go on a trip to Orlando where there's no YouTube TV, you can no longer access those local channels live or create new recordings. Content you've recorded is still accessible in the Library tab, and the cable channels are live. Weirder still, there are completely different restrictions if you travel to New York where there is YouTube TV. You can't see your Chicago stations live, but you can see the New York ones. However, you can't create new recordings on the local channels while in New York. The cable channel recordings work normally in this situation. There will be some other bizarre restrictions too; like no football games streamed on the phone. You have to cast them to a TV because Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL on mobile streaming. This whole situation only serves to remind us what a mess TV streaming rights have become. YouTube TV supports up to 6 accounts per subscription. They're tied to Google's family group system. You cannot set these up from the Android app, which is strange. YouTube TV invitations can only be sent from the web. That said, it works just fine once you get people added. Each user has their own settings and library of recordings. However, there's a maximum limit of three active streams per account. The value proposition here will depend on what you want out of TV. If you won't put up with missing a show here and there, YouTube TV probably won't work. The selection is better than other streaming-only services thanks to all the local channels, but you're still missing big ones like Comedy Central, MTV, HGTV, and TNT. For sports fans who have wanted to drop cable, this might finally be what lets you cut the cord. You ought to be able to see most everything with local channels, a few ESPNs, and other sports channels. If you haven't had cable for a while and Netflix is starting to get stale, YouTube TV could be just what you need. It gives you something to stream live, along with faster access to new episodes of your favorite shows. The $35 monthly cost is a bit steep for a single person, but if you've got a few family members who would use it, YouTube TV can be a very good value. I'm undecided if I'll keep YouTube TV past the one-month free trial. I already have Netflix and Hulu, and I don't watch sports. So, the added expense feels a little high. I expect Google will work to expand the channel list quickly, and YouTube TV might be an easy sell after a few additions. Tags Google hands-on Reviews streaming tv video youtube tv subscribe ...

Without any regional sports networks there will be a huge gap between cable and this service. Almost all major sports besides the NFL show local teams on regional sports networks. OligarchyAmbulance What networks are those? I don't really watch sports, but I know a lot of stuff around here is on Comcast Sports Net which are supported. Carson Saldanha NBA uses local networks for most regular season games with a few national broadcasts here and there. Taco Monster At least in Chicago, Bulls games are on CSN. Carson Saldanha Where I live, they use Root Sports. Raymie Humbert That's great in the markets except New York where SNY (majority owned by the Mets), YES (Fox Sports-owned) and MSG would all be necessary. Fox Sports would also be a must for expansion into quite a few additional major markets. 4Ui812 Google needs to allow us to choose our own channels. Don't need the sports and we shouldn't have to pay for over the air channels. I know it's still new and maybe somewhere down the line they'll do it but they could atleast have a option for not taking half of these shit channels so they can bring the price down. Jacob Fulbright So if you are one of the people who spoofed your GPS location to check this out, does it stop working once you turn the GPS spoof off and it realizes you're outside one of the regions in which the service is available? RyanWhitwam It only turns off local channel live streams. Jacob Fulbright That's what I'm mostly interested in as I don't get very good reception where I live. Strange that it wouldn't give you a choice of watching what's local to your current location or based on your "home" location. Darrin Lim I'm interested in Google's revenue model for this. Does it look like they are relying on subscriptions only, or are they also placing ads (either pre-roll or replacing network commercials) into the service as well? Or perhaps trying to drive users to standard YouTube vids (where they can do their normal ad placements) in the interface? Jacob Fulbright I was hoping this would have a tie in with major YouTube creators in some way. Good Mythical Morning, etc. Willie Chalmers III I'm sure this will be big media-oriented. YouTube is already for the PewDiePies, Good Mythical Mornings and the rest. cheeto0 The only place I see ads are in on demand. Darrin Lim Thanks @cheeto0:disqus This makes sense - with Live there's limited opportunity for pre-rolls as the user wants into the content as soon as possible so they don't miss anything. But with on-demand there's less time pressure, so they can put a pre-roll or two in. It does answer the question - both subscription and ad rev streams - I'm guessing YouTube could generate quite a lot from pre (and post?)-rolls against on-demand content. Do network ads remain in on-demand? Or are they replaced by YT ads or stripped completely? Shawn Spring I was hoping for a tie in with YouTube Red users, for maybe a modest monthly discount. No such luck. BhupSinghBhadu Baf Get some rest Carson Saldanha Man, no TNT for NBA basketball sucks dizel123 Man, no TNT! For NBA basketball sucks. Carson Saldanha ?` Shawn Spring I'm hoping this and Nick Jr (for the kiddos) comes sooner rather than later! freshprince_87 I hope they add it soon Lateef Alabi-Oki I think the nailed the user interface.

Tucker Sferro $35 is outrageous. You might as well jest get cable. Jacob Fulbright After you add in YouTube Red, Netflix, Hulu (or the ad-free premium Hulu), HBO GO, etc., yeah, cable isn't looking so bad anymore. Lateef Alabi-Oki Cable gives you unlimited DVR? psychoace Also you can't share cable with other people either BhupSinghBhadu Baf Good settings Shawn Spring Have you had a cable sub lately? I pay for a phone, small TV bundle w/DVR, and 100Mbps internet and its over $175/monthly. Even if I just had the internet alone (about $99/month) that and YouTube TV would save me quite a bit of money per year. C64 I thought 45 euro's for cable / internet / house phine was a lot over here 😮 suavemezie With YouTube TV, you will be doubling your data at least. Calculate Shawn Spring Hardwired broadband has no data cap so the amount of data I use is irrelevant - as I would likely be on WiFi when using YouTube TV at home. thespacecowboy Some people have data caps on wired internet. Shawn Spring Is that a real thing? Because I'd burn Spectrum to the ground if they tried to charge me a data cap like a Verizon style wireless plan. Chris Yeah, I want to say Cox had me capped at 100GB for the past 2-3 years. My parents had a similar cap but I just recently switched them to AT&T/DirecTV with unlimited data thespacecowboy oh yes. https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/12/netflix-calls-on-the-fcc-to-fix-unreasonable-data-caps/ Shawn Spring That's janky af thespacecowboy So Cox for basic channels is $80/month. HD receiver is $8.50/month. DVDR is additional $10 a month. So $35 a month? Doesn't seem to bad, but YMMV depending on what channels you really want/need. cheeto0 Plus it's like having 3 DVRs cable boxes.(6 sorta) and mobile access to it. cheeto0 I watch on 3 TV's and any mobile device, with unlimited DVR. I don't see that costing the same on cable. JDC Yeah, no. I was paying $140/month for TV (No DVR) and 25/25 internet (after 1 year at $80/month). I cut the cord and now I'm down to $50/month for just internet (100/100). YouTube TV brings me up to $85/month with "DVR" functionality, and that $35 isn't just some "introductory offer." I'm much better off than I was. wickets I'm paying 25$ just for local basic so youtube is a huge upgrade Brock Dawkins I had sling TV when it was first released and my God it was a nightmare. Only 1 stream per account, terrible app and no dvr. I tried the month free trial of YouTube TV and I love it. The interface is awesome. The DVR works great, and the storage is awesome. Can access dvr from anywhere too. I wish I wasn't locked into a DirecTV contract for two years. Only thing it needs is a few more channels and an Android TV app. Gfame103 No Android TV app at launch was hurtful. I'm really beginning to lose faith in Google. Everything that come out of Google is half baked and then support slowly begins to die. After the fall of Google Wallet card support, the dismantling of Google+, the slow death Hangouts, and lack of Android TV/Live Channels support I can not get to vested with their products. Maybe I will try YouTube TV in a few years.... If it's​ around. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Rip reader YaKillaCJ YouTube Red, Netflix and PSVue is currently the way to go as it covers everything except Viacom. Seems like YouTubeTV can be a replacement wants it mature. I'm dropping Hulu because that's covered by PSVue and HBO because honestly Game Of Thrones the only thing worth it in there Besides Sesame Street for the kids. thespacecowboy "For the kids". I love that show. Now, as for Daniel Tiger on PBS. That kid speaks the truth. Scott Kart Until Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, and SNY/MSG are on here...I'm out. thespacecowboy Don't lie. You're holding out for HGTV :) psychoace At least he has e! Corbin Davenport Tiny House Hunters deserves an Emmy. Taco Monster Sheer genius. cheeto0 The interface is great and the discovery is great. But it still feels a little beta in some areas. I can cast to Chromecast and the Nvidia shield but not to my Vizio TV with "chromecast built-in​ '. Also it doesn't like multiwindow in nougat...Plus no android tv app. But most google 1.0 products feel a little beta and then get reiterated upon. Overall I like it alot so far. King_Android I've been able to stream in 1080p. The interface also needs to show what's playing next. Not having the ability to quickly view what's next on a different channel is cumbersome. psychoace Not all channels or content is 1080p which is why the author thinks that Artem Russakovskii You're right, some channels do support 1080p. We'll update the post. John Doe True but not all channels and when comparing it to my TV service the quality is not the same on my 2nd generation chromecast compared to my Dish Network service. Youtube is probably using some lame video compression or the networks are whoever it is it sucks. newtonfb For people bitching about $35....split it with 3 friends and it comes out to $12 a month. Also you can get rid of Hulu because you have unlimited DVR so it acts like Hulu does and records the show you want. tim242 But...ads. Hulu with no ads = $12/mo. newtonfb Ya but you can fast forward past the ads with the DVR feature AlRegals The price tag is a little high for a single user, but the experience really does make me want to cancel Hulu. My biggest gripe with Hulu is the unreliability with cable tv shows. But if I can have easy access to my Syfy, USA, CW, Freeform, and Bravo along with not having to sign up for CBS Access to watch Big Bang then I'M IN. Plus Live TV?! I just need Android TV and Google Home support and this will be the perfect set up. Ramon Also note, there is NO 5.1 surround support on YouTube TV. John Doe Everything is great except the Youtube ads on-demand content and the resolution on most channels (watching on the web is worse than mobile and on tv). If Google can get Viacom and Turner Broadcasting channels, keep the price the same and "encourage" networks to upgrade to 1080P and 4K streams (at least have the on-demand in full HD), support HDR as well. Then the service will be perfect. Also, Where is the gaming console apps and other home entertainment devices? I wish they would have just updated the regular Youtube app. Now I have 4 youtube apps: Youtube Youtube TV Youtube Music Youtube Gaming Youtube kids They can easily tie all of that with the account instead of having 5 different apps Just have a section popup if a user is subscribed to a service. Bruce Wayne 4k and HDR?? Stop. 4k content isn't even produced on most TV channels and you're jumping to HDR. ISPs are already putting caps, charging for overages and charging extra for non bundled internet service. The bandwidth needed for 4k on one stream alone would strain most people's connections. TechGuy22 Mediocre start AlRegals Not sure how consist this is, but while watching Big Bang Theory on the desktop there I only got 3 15sec ads between segments. Switched over to my TV via Chromecast and the TV ads increased to 7 15sec ads. Just an observation bobinchicago Are "all local channels" just the 5 commercial networks, or do you also get independent channels, PBS, and subchannels? I've got 30 channels on my OTA Tivo and I've filtered a bunch out. There's 7 PBS channels alone. Also, you mention there's no Android TV app yet which sucks, but since the Nexus Player can act as a Chromecast, can you cast YouTube TV to that in particular? Thanks! ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I need AMC before I jump ship from PSV ...and it to be in my market NoNotTellingYou AMC is on the way according to Google. Mike Arnett If it recommends channels, will it recommend sports events based on teams you track on Google Assistant? Bruce Wayne That's a very good question. I'm sure Google will eventually learn how to tie in the service based on your search history and all that. SpiderDice No YouTube TV for Android TV? Totally makes sense.. ast00 Costs about 5 times as much as it should. DragoCubed I really like the design of this app. I won't say anything else because I'm not in the US. Bruce Wayne Device support is very key. It needs to support all the major devices and consoles (Xbox One, PS4, Roku, Fire devices, Android TV etc) Expand to five simultaneous streams.

The move came with YouTube striving to derail an ad boycott started by companies worried their brands might be paired with hateful videos at the service, which is part of California-based Google. "This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel," product management vice-president Ariel Bardin said in a blog post. "It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies." YouTube also plans to soon add a review process for new "creators" who want money-generating channels as part of a partner programme at the video-sharing service, according to Bardin. After a creator's channel passes the 10,000-view mark, the videos will be reviewed to determine whether they are in keeping with YouTube policies before ads are served up with content. "Together, these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules," Bardin said. Google needs to strike a balance between pleasing advertisers and those who upload videos to YouTube and are free to take creations elsewhere if unsatisfied with their shares of ad revenue. Google said early this week that it was using new artificial intelligence systems to enforce YouTube video policies and help weed out content objectionable to advertisers. These systems will be adapted to advertiser preferences, Google said. The tech giant also said it would work with third parties to help advertisers protect their brands from unwanted placement. Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads fearing placement alongside extremist content, has introduced new tools to give firms greater control. The boycott began in February after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programs were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google had failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the European Union after it anonymously signaled their presence. The movement spread to the United States, with AT&T and Verizon pulling ads from Google.

Pictured is Theodore Twombly, played by Joaquin Phoenix in the movie Her. In the movie, Theodore develops a romantic relationship with Samantha, an intelligent computer operating system  WHY ASSISTANTS SOUND FEMALE  The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has recently cited two studies that investigate these allegations, which have discovered that 'both women and men find the female voice welcoming and warm,' reports Joanna Stern with WSJ.  One study from Indian University played  male and female synthesized voices for both men and women. Both groups reported that the female voices sounded 'warmer'. The second study, from Stanford University, found people do prefer male voices – but only when it is used to teach them about computers. Computerized Female voices were only wanted when it came to giving love and relationship advice. The study, conducted by advertising agency JWT (J. Walter Thompson) and marketing company Mindshare, surveyed more than 1,000 UK smartphone owners aged 18 and over, as well as 100 Amazon Echo owners. It conducted a neuroscience experiment that found that the emotional response to voice assistants is considerably lower than for both a face-to-face human interaction and a touch or text interface, and this is likely to be a function of their current lack of complex personalities.  However, they found that the emotional response to Amazon's Alexa grew during the course of the experiment as people became more comfortable using it - indicating the potential for a closer relationship.  Elizabeth Cherian, the UK Director for, J. Walter Thompson Innovation Group, said in a statement: 'We are on the cusp of a new era in technology where voice is set to become mainstream.  'Our research shows that 88% of UK smartphone users have used voice technology or would consider doing so in the future.  'To successfully integrate voice into their offerings, brands need to understand how the technology can simplify everyday tasks by adding value and removing friction from their experience.  'This is not about tech for tech's sake.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Meet RoboRay, the ultimate underwater spy drone: Soft-body...

Share this article Share 14 shares 'Thoughtful and helpful interactions which genuinely enhance the experience will drive engagement and deeper relationships between consumers and brands.' The survey indicated that voice assistant are becoming increasingly popular: It said that according to Google, 20 per cent of mobile searches on Android are by voice.  Amazon has sold 11 million echoes and Google launched its own AI assistant, Google Home, in the UK today. According to the study, the current voice control landscape is dominated by Amazon, Google and Apple.  Facebook also has its own assistant, M, but it's currently only text-based and focused around Messenger.  Samsung launched its voice assistant Bixby for the Galaxy S8 in March, and Microsoft has developed Cortana, which works across Windows platforms.  Google launched its own AI assistant, Google Home (pictured left), in the UK today. The $130 (£129) speaker is triggered by the phrase  'Hey Google'. Picture right is Amazon's Echo, trigerred by the phrase 'Alexa'. Amazon Echo relies on Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia, while Google Home uses the company's own Google Search The most popular reason people use voice assistants is for convenience, with 55 per cent of respondents citing this as a reason.  45 per cent of respondents said they choose to use voice control because 'it's fun'.   When considering that voice assistant usage is skewed towards private spaces - especially the home, perhaps it's not surprising that so many users have sexual fantasies about their virtual assistants.  Interestingly, tech companies that design these devices tend to give them female voices.  Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant all have a female voice. Other than Apple adding the option of a male voice for Siri's British English version, all of the technology on the market speaks with a softer tone. Although some consider this move an act of sexism, two studies cited by the Wall Street Journal have revealed that both men and women preferred female voices - which were found to be 'warmer' and 'understanding'. Some other key findings from the study include that 52 per cent of smartphone users believe 'it would be easier if technology could speak back to me'.  72 per cent of regular voice assistant users think brands should have unique voices and personalities for their apps, instead of simply using a default assistant.   AMAZON ECHO VS GOOGLE HOME  Google's $130 (£129) Home speaker is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' while Amazon's Echo uses 'Alexa'. Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 (£145) Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 (£40) version called the Echo Dot.  Amazon Echo relies on Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia, while Google Home uses the company's own Google Search.  Both Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword — 'OK, Google' for Home and 'Alexa' for Echo.  Google's Assistant software is also able to answer follow-up questions on the same topic, in a near-conversation style, but Echo as yet can not.  However, Amazon's Alexa software has a wider range of skills on offer that enable it to link up with and control more third-party devices around the home.  A light comes on to remind you that it's listening.  You can turn off the microphone temporarily, too.

Google's 'Trusted Voice' feature keeps turning off for some users Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/01/08 11:18am PDTJan 8, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares192 Applications Google News The OK Google command is great, but I think we'd all agree that it can be a little... temperamental at times. Our Glorious Leader Artem recently took to Google+ to air his grievances about Trusted Voice, the feature that recognizes your voice and unlocks your phone accordingly. What happens when Trusted Voice is off. Specifically, Artem was complaining about Trusted Voice automatically, and seemingly randomly, turning itself off. This is annoying because it means when asking Google Assistant, or Voice Search on non-Pixel phones, the phone has to be manually unlocked before it answers.   Left: as you can see, Trusted Voice is off. Right: the Trusted Voice setup phase. This may be a bug limited to the Google app v6.10 beta, but I've found it happens with versions prior to that on my Nexus 6P. I'll set Trusted Voice up, and it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month - but then one day I'll ask it to play some music or set a timer and it'll say 'I can't do that as your phone needs to be unlocked' or something similar. Rinse and repeat. If Google wants to be the leader in the voice assistant market, it's crucial Assistant works as intended. This means improving the reliability of the OK Google command and ensuring it works 100% of the time. We'd be interested to hear your comments on this, and see if it's related to specific phones or versions of the Google app. Let us know in the comments!

Randomly works at times and other times it simply doesn't. mbarna I've been experiencing this bug on a Nexus 5x throughout the summer of 2016. Haven't seen it crop up recently though. Gonzales It happens on my 5X as well. I was chalking it up to Action Launcher 3 but it still happens with no launcher active. Very frustrating Van_Hammersly Same here. Nexus 5X. Although it happened on Nexus 5 and previous phones as well. Always took a reinstall. Artem Russakovskii Your GIF at least shows the voice prompt and then the lock. With Assistant, you just see the lock, and the voice prompt only shows up after you unlock, which... well, is just as frustrating. Chris Ledbetter Mine on my pixel will show a message saying i have to unlock the device and the prompt is no longer up forcing me to do it all over again. SMH Not a big deal, just something that should be flawless from a search giant... The Fink it happens on Samsung phones as well. Arie Yup, this is happening to me for quite a while.. Nexus 6P, on 7.1.1 blassster This has happened to me before as well, most recently after applying this month's security patch. Anthony McCann Well, on the plus side, at least the voice command was for a good cause Ailín Ó’S This has always happened to me, it's never worked. I have my phone in Irish/Gaeilge and Google in English (Ireland). Goyam Jain This issue has been with me on the Galaxy Su Edge running Android Marshmallow since when I bought it in November. It sucks when it happens JPJ My XL works sporadically and I'm using the Jan update. John Doe Trusted Voice isn't even available on the Nexus 6. I believe it used to be there but I don't know what happened. JasonIvers Did anyone ever find out why the Nexus 6 doesn't have that option? I never did see a reason, just that it was the case. It generally doesn't affect me, as I have trusted devices most places I would actually consider using it. Noeltorious Used to be there, and if you toggled it on it would toggle itself back off. Must've been really broken for them to disable and then remove it digitalcircuit I've had a similar issue where "Say 'Ok Google' any time" keeps turning off a split second after I enable it. Checking logcat points to "AlwaysOnHotword start recognition failed with error 14" and "sound_trigger stdev_load_sound_model failed." Upgrading/downgrading Google Search doesn't help. Frustratingly enough, this was working fine for a month or two on CM 13.. then broke. Then worked again when upgrading to CM 14.1.. then broke a month later. Nexus 6. Logan Snyder I have a 5X, I haven't noticed trusted voice turning off randomly, but I've noticed the "Ok Google command" has a lower and lower recognition rate until it becomes abysmal and almost never recognizes the command. I have to retrain the voice mondel like once a month. chinna_rao I've been having this problem with my device for quite some time but then, it just blew up when I repeatedly tried "OK Google" ing it...Samsung Note 7 matteventu "it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month" You are lucky then. With Pixel XL it happens that you setup the "Ok Google" always on and as trusted voice, and after HOURS it stops responding, forgetting the "vocal-training" you made. And there's no a toggle for this, you have to reinitiate every fu**ing time the vocal setup. Ernie Mine is fine sproc Well at least your fingerprint reader still exists, lol. Some of these issues are like Win9x era crap. ehTuBrutus Happens to me Everytime I switch between user accounts. Gives me a pop-up saying it has been turned off so I took it to be by design. I take it others have it happening even when not switching accounts? I wonder if Artemis has more than one user açcount on his phone? Andrew Palmer I used it to skip a track the other day. I didn't like the next track either so tried to do OK Google again. No response. Joe Mihalich I experienced this twice on the first day I received my pre-ordered Pixel XL. After i retrained it the second time, it hasn't happened again. Lucky me. Now if they would just fix the stupid freeze/lockup issue i can get on with my life. Brian Demodulated Trusted Voice is always turned on for me but often when I give a voice command I'm prompted to unlock my phone before the command is executed. So annoying. whispy_snippet Yep, I experience all of the above on my Pixel. Sucky. shamatuu yep nexus 6P. been turned off on its own for couple of months and yet Google seems to not care to fix it. really hope they fix it ASAP because they not what they used to be. blakeleeper Its happening on my Pixel XL v6.10.33.21 Kwetsima Maluleke Its been doing this to me for ages. About a year maybe. David Hyman Me too but it has been working a lot better for me for a while now Sharondhart Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Les Deplorables Yep...ages here too! Annoying. Michael Gerberich I have a similar issue with Trusted places. It works for a while and then just stops working. S7 Edge. vwnut13 Didn't OK Google used to work with a locked screen? Jimas Happens on my Nexus 6P Google v6.10.33.21. It started happening maybe a week or two ago, but it resets almost like every 2-3 days. Zaptor99 On my Note 4, I don't have Trusted Voices, I have "Personal Results". I turned it on. But If I go to Maps, Settings, Navigation, Ok Google, then the same screen from google app appears, but instead of "Personal Results", I see "Trusted Voice" and it's turned off and it then automatically turns off "Personal Results" in google app. Very confusing. Grey Are we reporting bugs on AP now? Because there are tons of bugs to report, especially with Google Now. It doesn't make sound anymore for one. If your phone is in landscape mode and you get it to turn on, it will turn on then stop because it's in landscape mode and you have to repeat it. Not to mention it does not respond every time. And try saying "remind me tonight dentist appointment at 11 am", cause what it will give you is a reminder for "tonight dentist appointment" due at 11 am. It's got issues. We gonna call them on all of it and try and get some pressure on Google to fix stuff? You gotta do it AP, we can't. Ibrahim Yusuf It happend for me on my nexus 5x on marshmallow, even updating to nougat didn't fix it. But I fixed it by deleting the voice model and retraining again. I got an answer on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/5bgngq/cant_activate_always_on_ok_google_voice_detection/ Amir This is not new. I've been having this issue since the beginning of 2015 on my Nexus 6, 6P and now on Pixel XL. Ive completely given up on that feature. opticalgenesis Same here :( - also bonus points for Muse Himesh Kulkarni Same problem here but works less than a month, maybe like a few days. Also, I don't get any reply, it's just blank (doesn't work). Peter Me: "OK Google" Pixel: "Bleep" Me: "Read last message" Pixel: "You have one last message, would you like to hear it?" Me: "Yes" Pixel: "OK, cool, cool." ... Me: "WTF?" Andre Only once this has happened on my Nexus 5X. I have not experienced this issue in a while. jack_k1 I absolutely loath saying"OK Google". It just doesn't roll off the tongue. I feel like I'm gargling. demarcmj Even if it did "roll off the tongue," four syllables is just way too much. Fatty Bunter Google Home accepts "Hey google" too, which is much better. Hopefully they'll add this to phones too. Cory S Hey Google has a much lower activation rate than Okay Google for me, which is a shame because I hate that hot phrase. jack_k1 Try using Trusted Face when you have a long flowing beard. Hah! nxtiak YES!!! My Pixel XL suffers this issue, so f'ing annoying, I thought I was going crazy! JimOnTheBeach Yes happens on my new LG V20.i thought I was doing something wrong. Shawna Bartron This has never worked for me. LG Stylo 2 Travis James I don't have this issue, but I will keep yelling at my phone when driving "OK Google" with no response. When I have a chance to pick up my phone and unlock, I see that it can't reach Google, even though I have connectivity. Super annoying. Brandon Buchanan I use this feature all the time, but never have trouble with it on my Nexus 5x. King_Android Expect bugs with Beta. Uninstall beta clear data enable using default Google now launcher and all is well. catalysto For as long as I've had my 6P, I've had a similar problem. After a week or so, saying "OK Google" with the screen off stops working. If I toggle the settings off and back on, it works again for a while. But then usually by the time I actually need it, it has stopped working again. I gave up on it and just use the microphone button now for voice commands. Van_Hammersly It's done this to me on at least three separate phones over the past few years. Random and annoying. Each time I think when I get a new phone it'll stop doing it, foolishly. Parneet Singh It always does after few days on my nexus 5 X. Ok google stops responding to voice commands dmo580 That's not the same as Trusted Voice turning off. You're talking about OK Google detection just failing. The screenshots here specifically show the toggle being turned off. Let's not mix up two issues. Yvonne Campbell I have this issue as well, where both the 'trusted voice' and 'detection from any screen' toggles get turned off. gtoninn I have had the same thing happen to me. In addition to that the most recent update to the Google app has left my manually requested google searches with voice (IE I hit the voice search button), getting stuck and then the Google App has to be restarted. Also on a 6P Pyrazol You mention this now? It's been doing that to me for AGES. I thought switching from the Moto X to the Nexus 6 would ease my woes, but nooo. I just don't use that shit anymore because it's so freaking unreliable. dmo580 You don't even have trusted voice on the Nexus 6 as an option in the Google App. Keep in mind this issue is a very specific one regarding trusted voice. Moto's own implementation of always on listening is different as they pay for the license themselves. Cypress Frankenfeld Has anyone logged an issue on the Android bug tracker? I'd gladly star it. Joe Mine's always done this, it just randomly stops working. I always thought it was just because of updates causing it to shut down and needing to be reactivated. sea_hawk I have the same issue for a month. after I joined the 7.1.1 beta and then left the beta, but still experiencing the issue. sea_hawk Never mind... just tried enabling it, and it finally let me do that... not sure what happened. But in the past when I tried enabling trusted voice, it would ask me to input my pattern, but after I do that, the button stays "off"... sorry, not of much help HotRodJohnson Welcome to the world of the Nexus 6 users. The forum for this feature says, Hey Nexus 6 user, you can forget about it! Noeltorious I actually have a similar issue on the Pixel XL. I'll say OK Google and it will wake the screen up and show me the lock screen. Subsequent OK Google's or swiping to launch from the lock screen just point me to use my fingerprint to login. Once I use the fp-sensor the screen unlocks with Assistant launched. Weird and annoying, haven't figured out steps to reproduce because it's so random I don't think it's toggling off though because I never have to toggle anything on to fix it. RecalcitrantOne Just commenting to echo what others have said, happens to me and my 5x. Wouldn't mind being able to set my own "hot phrase." Either way, the emphasis is wrong with "Okay Google." The emphasis is on the second syllable of okay, but first for Google so it's not smooth. Rob I also noticed it deactivated many times, making it unreliable (Nexus 6P 7.1.1). It's been deactivating since the summer but it's a few weeks it hasn't anymore. I hope this gets addressed. Ashlynn This happens for me. Google Pixel version 7.1.1 - Google version 6.10.36.21amd 64. This recently started happening for me. Had no issues a few weeks ago. Chris Tashjian Same here!! It's been resetting on me daily for the last couple weeks jaxjoe Same issue with my PixelXL - was working up until 2-3 weeks ago. Now it doesn't stay turned on for more than a few hours at a time Luke Taylor Ohhhhhh yeah. It'd happened to me only 4 or 5 times on my 6P in the last year, but suddenly in the past two weeks it's happened to me about 6 times- which is how I found this article just now. Come on, Google! stephen Galaxy s7. turns off in middle of voice searches and even while I'm typing in a search. Annoying to have to start typing all over again! Version 6.0.1 Niels Buekers I get this on my Pixel XL since a week or 2.. nikov I've had it happen a few times in the past on my Nexus 6P, but it has become very common in the last month or two. I'm running in to real issues with it at this point. bryguy76 I have a Pixel XL, worked fine for the first month, and then started turning off all the time. It's so annoying. Miguel Dey My pixel just started doing this.. any fix for it yet? Random! LG G3 D855, stock fw. Started happening to me a few days ago. Now this feature freaks out every couple days. Russ We have two Pixels and both do this. It's infuriating. It'll work flawlessly some days and then sometimes we'll say "OK, Google" and just get the lock screen and then go into the settings and find Trusted Voice has turned itself off arbitrarily. Trueblue711 It must be a bug with Google Play services. I'm one of the very few people with a Nexus 6p still running Android 6.0 and this bug happens to me all the time. Ronny Keller Disabling "Battery Optimization" for the item "ok Google enrollment" seems to do the trick for some users. Aaron Kelly I hope this does the trick. I'm trying it. It makes sense. Joe Mihalich This is still happening to me with google app 6.10.37.21. Kris Tyler This is happening at least monthly on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Then it makes me retrain it and opt in. EVERY FREAKING TIME. So annoying, especially when it won't dial numbers when I'm driving. It's enough to make me consider an Apple. Al It happens on Pixel too. I'm starting to wonder if it's anytime the phone restarts. SSt Me too. Nexus 6p Laksamana Just happened to me since last week (Galaxy S6 on Android 6.0.1). Kept asking me to opt back in into Trusted Voice. Andrew Slater I have a 6p on version 7.1.1 and it had been doing this for a month or 2. But instead of it turning off a couple months apart, it turns off after only a couple days. Very annoying. JC Pixel XL, Android 7.1.2, Google App version 6.12.19.21.arm64. Does this multiple times a day, multiple times a week. So annoying it's driving me crazy. Been this this since my Nexus 6P a year ago Austin Ingram So annoying. It stays on for maybe a day or two then it's off again. Austin Ingram It may be related to training it in noisy environments - if you do that then try to activate it when it's quiet it may not recognize your voice and disable it for "security". Ankit Sud It's happening frequently with my Pixel as well. Defeats the biggest use case for Assistant in my opinion. Kyle Bailey Still happening with my Pixel. Is there any fix? bluescrubbie Just spent a while on chat with Google support. They say they've fixed the issue and we'll be rolling it out in an update soon. Patrick Ledwith Really? That's a relief. Garth Hedley I have Nexus 6P and 7.1.1. so fault is not restricted to earlier Android versions. I've set up TV numerous times. Each time after phone locks, Google app voice says can't do that phone is locked. Tatyana Tatyana I turn it on and the same day the "Trusted Voice" option will turn itself off. Drives me fucking bananas. PeterDTown Infuriating! It seems that every time I try to use this feature it's turned off again. Katie Conforti Seems if you don't use your phone for 4 hours the setting gets disabled. So annoying, makes assistant nearly worthless. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en Aaron Kelly My 6p has been doing this for about the last month or two. Every 3-7 days it happens. It's frustrating. I use the Trusted Voice to dial all the time, so when it doesn't work because of something like this, it makes me mad. Shannon Doak It is happening with my Pixel as well. stsin 6P on fi started doing it after I went off the beta os test due to severe battery issues. Dušan Todorović "trusted voice" my ***. After setting it for who knows how many times, yesterday, when i wanted it to start Clash of clans, that annoying answer pulled my nerve with "actually i cant do that while the device is locked, please, unlock blablabla.." for the last time. I disabled it. Guys doing the Ok Google "magic", clearly this is happening for a while and to many people, independant of android version, root opt, device, launcher, gapps version, google+ version, etc. Either fix the darn thing or stop pretending to be Siri's competitor. This sucks big time. Simon Jude I have this exact problem! I'm on an LG K7, anyone actually know how to fix this? Paul Kopalek My Nexus 6P turns the 'Anywhere' feature off INSTANTLY when I turn it on. Even when wiping Google app data, clean flashing the 7.1.1 ROM all over again, and disabling Battery Optimization for 'OK Google Enrollment. This is infuriating. Dave Segal HTC One M8 and galaxy 7 Yvonne Campbell Yes!! It's not just my trusted voice that gets turned off but my detection from any screen. Suddenly I can't just say "ok google" and get a response without touching my phone. Rather defeats the purpose. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Another issue I'm having, but think it would be a phone issue, is that I have answer calls with voice commands turned on, and even though it stays turned on, it does not work anymore. PP Saini I have the opposite issue. The "any time" option will not stay off. I toggle it off, but am immediately able to say OK Google with my phone responding. Check the setting, and it is oddly back on. Kristina Starck Constantly on my Note 5. It also pops up a window asking me what I just said everytime I listen to anything with my headphones plugged in. Even disabling the assistant altogether doesnt stop the spam. Callahan Jason Droid Maxx 2 - used to turn off randomly, more recently I can not keep it on. If I switch it on back out to previous screen then go back-it will be off Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 141k 104k Latest Deals 0 [Deal Alert] Snag an Arlo Pro 3-pack from Amazon for $500 ($80 off) 2017/04/06 7:07pm PDTApr 6, 2017 25 [Deal Alert] Grab these free and 10-cent apps, games, and icon packs 2017/04/05 6:44am PDTApr 5, 2017 22 [Deal Alert] The Moto G4 Plus is $189.99 ($60 off) on Amazon 2017/04/04 2:26pm PDTApr 4, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Amazon is discounting unlocked phones from Sony, LeEco, Lenovo, and more by up to $125 2017/04/04 12:33pm PDTApr 4, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Amazon has a 2-node Netgear Orbi Home WiFi system and an Echo Dot bundle for $330 ($91 off) 2017/04/04 12:00pm PDTApr 4, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares111 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Justin W This is an instant buy for me if it's true.

Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? Luxferro I've spent tons of $$$ on new routers throughout my years of being a computer geek. I tried Eeros for a month or so during their beta period, before I realized that I don't like dumbed down devices that you can't fully control. I'm anti-corporate-cloud based products. I have my own server and prefer my data be only on my server. After the Eero experience I gave Ubiquiti a try, and haven't looked back. Ordeith Ubiquiti is awesome. Google is crap. Luxferro You stalking me from the Chromebook thread? ;p Ordeith Are you using their EdgeRouter? How do you like it? Luxferro I have both, but switched from the edgeRouter to the UniFi router after buying more UniFi access points and UniFi switches. You manage all UniFi devices from one interface (the UniFi controller). Both are good, but the UniFi router is behind the edge in UI features. But pretty much anything lacking in the UI can be done via CLI. They update the UniFi router regularly, and have different branches so you can test new features, etc, if you want. But eventually the UI features will be on par with the edge. All the images I posted above are from the UniFi controller, which you can run in a VM, docker, or any PC on your network (windows, linux), or buy the dedicated CloudKey controller that can be powered by PoE. I really like it, and think it's awesome if you like to control everything and have oversight of your network. Also the developers actually interact with their customers via their forums (are not clueless customer support types), take feedback, help narrow down bugs, and are quick to patch in fixes. Ordeith I've used their access points in a number of projects, but not their routers. I have one site that has a need for ingress bandwidth control (rate limiting) on a per vlan basis. How is ubiquiti's stuff at handling configurations like that? Luxferro I haven't played with vlans or used any bandwidth limiting features. They do have vlan capabilities though, which are exposed in the controller UI. But not sure about the bandwidth limiting features. Ordeith Thanks. I'll research further. supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ?

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Google Pixel 2 pops up on AOSP Mobile Phones Google Pixel 2 pops up on AOSP By Bindu Nair - Apr 6, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Image credit: Benjamin Geskin Rumors so far have hinted that Google is hard at work on 3 different flagship devices this year. These could be two regular Pixel 2 phones and one super-sized one. Now a new report has caught the new entries on the brand’s own Android Open Source Project (AOSP) forums. To recall, the next-gen Pixels are believed to be codenamed walleye, muskie, and taimen. Android Police has now uncovered all 3 terms buried within the AOSP gerrit. Google’s Treehugger update bot was reporting the targets for changes. Unfortunately, little else can be gleaned from the sighting. Still, it leads further credence to the theory that Google is coming out with 3 high-end products this year. Moreover, each name corresponds to a type of fish, in keeping with the company’s penchant for aquatic codenames. Also Read: Google starts Android 7.1.2 Nougat rollout Going by the size of each fish, walleye probably corresponds to the Pixel 2, muskie to the Pixel 2 XL, and taimen to the Pixel 2 XXL. It should be noted that these names haven’t been confirmed yet. The last may not even be a phone. It could be a tablet or a laptop-tablet 2-in-1. There’s a chance it’s not even related to the Pixel lineup and is in fact a completely separate series. Google has been tight-lipped about the second generation of its flagship smartphones. Till date, it’s only confirmed that the handsets are coming out later this year and will stay premium. The latter assertion threw cold water over expectations that the firm might be thinking of producing a cheaper version dubbed the Pixel 2B.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google Play Music All Access lands in India Software Google Play Music All Access lands in India By Bertila Helena - Apr 6, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Google Play Music had arrived in India back in September last year, letting people buy songs and albums across a wide range of genres. However, one feature that was conspicuously missing was All Access, the company’s subscription-based streaming service. In good news for users who prefer streaming to buying songs, Google Play Music All Access has landed in India after a nearly 6-month delay. It’ll set consumers back by Rs 89 per month. However, this figure might be an introductory offer which will be around for the next 45 days. Google hasn’t officially announced the arrival of All Access yet, so it’s possible the service is slowly being rolled out to customers in India. At present, the Play Music site is asking individuals to ‘Try Unlimited’ and promises a 30-day free trial period before the Rs 89 monthly fee kicks in. Also See: Google adds Free App of the Week section to Play Store Once a user successfully signs up for All Access, they’ll be asked to choose their preferred music genres like Punjabi or World. Google then recommends music based on their choices and history. It has over 35 million tracks tucked away in its database covering both Indian and international artists. Subscribers also have the freedom to upload 50000 songs of their own and download music for when they go offline, an important feature for those having to deal with unreliable connectivity issues. They’ll further get access to Play Music’s Radio tool. The feature generates playlists based on their location, mood, or activities. You can sign up for Google Play Music All Access here and download the app via the Play Store or App Store.

The move came with YouTube striving to derail an ad boycott started by companies worried their brands might be paired with hateful videos at the service, which is part of California-based Google. "This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel," product management vice president Ariel Bardin said in a blog post. "It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies." YouTube also plans to soon add a review process for new "creators" who want money-generating channels as part of a partner program at the video-sharing service, according to Bardin. After a creator's channel passes the 10,000-view mark, the videos will be reviewed to determine whether they are in keeping with YouTube policies before ads are served up with content. "Together, these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules," Bardin said. Google needs to strike a balance between pleasing advertisers and those who upload videos to YouTube and are free to take creations elsewhere if unsatisfied with their shares of ad revenue. Google said early this week that it was using new artificial intelligence systems to enforce YouTube video policies and help weed out content objectionable to advertisers. These systems will be adapted to advertiser preferences, Google said. The tech giant also said it would work with third parties to help advertisers protect their brands from unwanted placement. Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads fearing placement alongside extremist content, has introduced new tools to give firms greater control. The boycott began in February after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programs were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google had failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the European Union after it anonymously signaled their presence. The movement spread to the United States, with AT&T and Verizon pulling ads from Google. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

"What our clients want and what our agencies want is more competition of the space, anything that gives more competition to the duopoly of Facebook and Google," Sorrell said to CNBC. The two tech giants account for about 75 percent of digital ad budgets, according to Sorrell. But, there are competitors ready to chip away at their dominance, including AOL and Yahoo's ad tech platforms and Snap. Even Amazon is becoming a threat, with its ad platform recently valued at $350 billion, he pointed out. "Getting more than two solutions is important," he said. But while Google's issue of ads appearing next to questionable content is causing companies to pull dollars right now, Sorrell doesn't think the moves will be permanent because of how big of a presence the company has in digital adverting. WPP spent a little under $5 billion on Google media buys last year. "You're negating or withdrawing from arguably one of the most powerful mediums," Sorrell said.

Google Home – Released In The U.K. Today! Facebook Twitter Google+ Print E-mail Posted by: Morgan Walker on 6 April, 2017 7:02 PM Google Home is the multinational tech companies answer to the Amazon Echo which is, already, moving off the shelves swiftly. The personal assistant slash home speaker from Google costs £129 and is now available to purchase from online retailers in the U.K. Google were kind enough to send us one to review at the Gadgethelpline. As you can see, the rear of the device shows a single button, this disables/enables the inbuilt far-field microphones. Front view Rear view   Upon opening the well crafted box that contains your new assistant you will find one Google Home, a small info pack and one power adaptor. As you can see from the pictures shown, this device only needs a power connection to function, the rest is wireless.  So, before you rush full steam ahead plugging it in there is one thing you will need to do. First off, install Google Home on your computer, tablet or phone then plug in Google Home before loading the app. Base Make sure the device running the app is on wifi, then load Google Home. If it does not automatically detect the Home device then you will need to tap the icon on the top right which will then show you the devices in range and give you the option to either ignore or go through setup.  We have included screenshots of the setup process below: [Show thumbnails] Once you have completed the setup process then Google should now be available to assist you with every whim. Using the device once it is setup: Google Home will try to answer all of your questions, just remember to phrase your question correctly,  “Okay Google” or “Hey, Google” should work every time and bring the device to life. Google Home will link with existing devices you have such as Google Chromecast and other Wifi devices almost seamlessly. Once you have set up the respective app/device in Google Home you can then ask Google to assist you. For example: OK Google, Load Netflix, Play Bojack Horseman episode 1… Google Home can also play music you cast to it from Apps such as Google Play Music. We tested the sound with a podcast and for a small speaker, the bass seems crisp and the trebles are clear. Google have also adapted the voice of its assistant to be British and the system behind its operation has been enhanced to recognize the variety of vocal tones from around the U.K. When you consider the number of local dialects in the U.K., this is quite impressive. When asked how many languages Google Home speaks it answered with an extensive list and explained that it will be adding more. Home can repeat a phrase for you and almost lends itself to be a language learning assistant as you can ask Home to repeat the phrase while you practice it. The top of the Home device is a touch sensitive surface which can be operated with a small tap, you can also turn the volume up and down by moving clockwise or anti-clockwise around the colored circle. As well as internal microphones, there is also 802.11ac Wi-Fi, a speaker system and Bluetooth capability, the latter being unavailable at launch though.  With regards to the device itself, it is easy to set-up, the speakers are good and can be heard clearly both near and far. Google are already known in the field of AI (Deepmind etc)so we expect to see many improvements on this device over the next few months. Due to only having the device running for a few hours you can expect the full review a little further down the line when it has been extensively tested. The setup and first impression for Google Wifi will be coming tomorrow so watch this space!   Facebook Twitter Google+ Print E-mail Tags: assistant, google, Google Home, WiFi Post a comment Cancel reply Your comment * Your email address will not be shared or made public.

 Goldman Sachs wants to become the Google of Wall Street Matt Turner Apr. 6, 2017, 3:15 PM 12,807 facebook linkedin twitter email print Marty Chavez, center, Goldman Sachs' deputy chief financial officer, with the team from Kensho.Twitter.com/GoldmanSachs Marty Chavez, a top executive at Goldman Sachs, has outlined a radical future for the Wall Street bank. He has said he wants Goldman Sachs to be for risk what Google is for search. "We're packaging everything we do, and actually, we're redesigning the whole company, around APIs." Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, decided a couple of years ago that one of his star executives needed a mentor. A little while later, Marty Chavez, who is about to become the bank's chief financial officer, received an unexpected email. "Hey Marty, I'd like to come over to your office to introduce myself," it said. It was from Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet. "We've been talking ever since about the similarities in the businesses," Chavez told a group of computer scientists earlier this year about the message. "Some of the similarities are aspirational, I have to emphasize that, and some are there right now." The comments shine a light on how Goldman Sachs' leadership see its future. It's possibly the future of all of Wall Street — because where Goldman Sachs goes, the Street often follows. It goes beyond the automation that has been creeping across trading floors for years and is now being applied to investment banking, a business that had been considered much less vulnerable to automation. Instead, Chavez's comments establish a more radical vision for Goldman Sachs and set out how Silicon Valley giants are inspiring that change. And yes, people will lose their jobs if this is how it goes. 'The fundamental truth of Goldman Sachs' Chavez was speaking at the Harvard Institute for Applied Computational Science in January. About a month ago, a video of the talk was made public on YouTube, and it has since been viewed only about 200 times. In it, Chavez said, "Goldman is for risk what Google is for search." Here's how Chavez described Google in his presentation: "Google produces software services, and those software services aggregate the attention of billions of people, and then Google sells the attention of billions of people to advertisers." And here's how he described Goldman Sachs: "A client has a risk they don't want or wants a risk they don't have, and we make it happen for them. This is the fundamental truth of Goldman Sachs. If the clients stop calling and talking to us about risks they have but don't want or want but don't have, then we have no business whatsoever." With that in mind, Goldman Sachs has built what it calls Data Lake, pulling in information on transactions, markets, and investment research, as well as insights from emails, voice calls, and instant messages. The bank is putting all that data in the same place and applying machine learning. The idea is to guide employees on who to call and when. Goldman Sachs "What really makes us valuable is the immense amount of data that we have," Chavez said. "In this job of inspiring our clients to call us because they have risks they don't want or want risks they don't have, there is incredible information content, and using that for the benefit of the clients to get a better result is what we're up to." The vision set out by Chavez goes further than better utilizing data for internal needs, however. He said: "Imagine if Google had gone a slightly different route and they said, 'Every time somebody wants to do a search, they pick up the phone, call their Google salesperson, read the search terms to the Google salesperson, who types them into the internal Google search engine, gets the results, and then reads them back over the phone.' "That is not the route Google took. Unfortunately, that is a pretty good description of how Wall Street works." In other words, the first step is amassing and analyzing the data, and the next step is putting the data into the hands of clients. Chavez also included this slide in his presentation showing Goldman Sachs' current approach, multiple data owners sending data to multiple clients:Goldman Sachs The new plan, in contrast, has one data services hub, which draws data from owners (exchanges, vendors, and Goldman's transactions) into one location then disburses it to clients. It's a model based on APIs, which are the standard way for computer programs to "talk" to one another without human intervention. When you use your Facebook account to log in to Spotify, that's Spotify talking to the Facebook login API. Famously, Jeff Bezos mandated several years ago that the only way Amazon teams could integrate their products would be via API, in a bid to increase the efficiency and speed at which programmers can build new services. In his presentation, Chavez highlighted revenues from APIs at Salesforce, eBay, and Expedia. This model is based on taking in data, pushing it through analytics engines, then making it available to internal and external clients through the Goldman Sachs digital platform that Chavez has championed. "Historically, the API has been human beings talking to other human beings over the telephone, and all the tools, the content, the analytics is on the internal platform only," Chavez said. "We are shifting this radically and shifting this fast, and we're packaging everything we do, and actually, we're redesigning the whole company, around APIs." Goldman Sachs That model has a few consequences. First, if you work on or have friends on Wall Street, you likely know someone whose job it is to play the equivalent of the Google salesperson in Chavez's example. This API-driven approach does not bode well for that person. Second, it positions Goldman Sachs as a kind of information-technology company. "We're turning all of the verbs, all of the activities at Goldman Sachs, into APIs," Chavez said. "One of the things we're insisting on is a very high standard of lovely and impeccable documentation for these APIs, because we're opening up the vertical monolith which used to have only one API point, which was human beings on the phone."

Joe Mullin - Apr 6, 2017 7:22 pm UTC Enlarge Waymo reader comments 82 Share this story SAN FRANCISCO—A heated discovery process continued to play out today in the lawsuit between Waymo and Uber, when a hearing ended with a federal judge ordering Uber to allow a Waymo-chosen expert and attorney to examine Uber's LiDAR system. US District Judge Alsup also said he's likely to order documents to be handed over, beginning with a privilege log. He even suggested that lawyers for Anthony Levandowski, the Uber engineer at the heart of the case, start preparing an emergency appeal motion to challenge him. Those statements came at the end of a hearing that lasted more than an hour, which mainly focused on arguments over a privilege log—essentially, a list of documents that the defendant, Uber, believes should be withheld from the other side for one reason or another. In February, Google's Waymo self-driving car division filed a lawsuit that accused Levandowski of stealing 14,000 confidential documents while he worked at Google. Today, Levandowski's lawyer Ismail Ramsey laid out his argument that Waymo lawyers shouldn't even get a privilege log, because Levandowski has asserted his Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination. "They want to know—what are the files he gave, where are they, and who has them now?" said Ramsey. "The Fifth Amendment prevents this. What they can't get from Mr. Levandowski, they're seeking to pry from his lawyers." Ramsey pointed to a joint defense agreement between Levandowski and various law firms that meant that nothing should be revealed. Even though his client, Levandowski, isn't the one being asked for documents or testimony, the Uber privilege log is "implicit testimony" that should be protected, he argued. "Where does this joint defense agreement reference privilege logs?" asked US District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the case. "It doesn't," acknowledged Ramsey. "Where does your agreement refer to the 5th Amendment?" asked Alsup. "It doesn't, specifically," said Ramsey. "They want to start down the path—to get to a beginning point, a lead, towards understanding where those documents are. That's what the 5th Amendment prevents." Under further questioning, a vague outline became clear of what Ramsey was trying to protect. Uber's lawyers have a privilege log hundreds of pages long, much of it e-mail from Uber's systems about the $680 million acquisition of Levandowski's startup, Otto. Levandowski is concerned about 42 documents that relate to a due diligence report about the Otto acquisition. His lawyers won't even say who the report's author is. "We just heard that Mr. Levandowski is asserting his 5th Amendment rights very broadly, and that will have severe consequences on this case," said Melissa Baily, representing Waymo. "Uber and Otto don't have 5th Amendment rights. They're corporations." She continued: Mr. Levandowski has not been asked to testify about anything. If they want to assert a common interest privilege, then they can do that in a privilege log. But they need to do it in a lot of detail. And there’s no reason they should not be made to provide the name of a third-party author. At various times during the hearing, Alsup expressed frustration with both Uber's and Levandowski's lawyers and suggested they were trying to confuse and delay. Today's hearing is the first time the judge had even heard the number of documents Levandowski was concerned with. Missing report, mystery author "Well, who's got the due diligence report?" Alsup asked at one point. "That, Your Honor, is what we're fighting about," said Ramsey. "Exposing that provides a link in the chain. The information could provide a prosecutor a starting point." "Well, what’s wrong with that?" said Alsup. "It would be the third party doing the testimony. You are hiding from me what the real facts are, and you want me to be in the dark." Ramsey asked for Alsup to review the "in camera," in a secret proceeding where Waymo's lawyers wouldn't get to view them. Alsup agreed to read the unredacted list of the 42 documents in question, while Waymo lawyers were handed a redacted version. "This is clearly a shell game intended for delay," said Waymo attorney Baily. "Mr. Levandowski is still at Uber, and still, seemingly, has our documents. Mr. Levandowski is still running Uber's self-driving car program. Yesterday we heard about a 200 to 400 page privilege log. Today, we heard 42 entries are at issue." Alsup was sympathetic to the need to move quickly. "This is a fast-moving industry," said the judge. "I’ve already delayed the hearing until May 3rd. Come May 3rd, I don't want someone saying there are unresolved issues." He continued: Right now, the record available to the court, under oath, is pretty convincing that Mr. Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents, wiped his computer clean, transferred those documents to a thumb drive, and took that thumb drive with him when he went to start a new company. That's the record—undenied. It's possible when the Uber opposition [papers] come in, we'll see it's completely false. But right now, it's not. And that record warrants some expedition. Alsup ended the hearing by saying the record warrants allowing a Waymo expert and attorney to examine Uber's LiDAR system, the technology at issue in the case. He also said there's a "substantial risk" he's going to order the privilege log to be produced, in short order. He suggested that Ramsey start writing up his emergency appeal motion immediately. "I hope the court of appeals will read this record, to see the obfuscation the poor judge has been subjected to on this motion," Alsup said. "We didn't use this stuff" Uber attorney Arturo Gonzalez briefly spoke to reporters in the hall after the hearing. As to whether the identity of the third party that made the due diligence report can be protected by Levandowski's 5th Amendment plea, "it's an interesting legal argument," he said. It isn't Uber's argument, but they're letting their employee make the case. "We want to respect the judge's orders, and also respect our employee's rights," he said. "Our bottom line is, at the end of the day, we didn't use any of this stuff," said Gonzalez. "It didn't make it to Uber. That's our story. There's no evidence that any of those 14,000 files ever made it to an Uber computer. The issue is Levandowski's personal stuff, which we don't have access to." A reporter then asked, why not employ the strategy Alsup had suggested at an earlier hearing—that Uber could compel disclosure by penalizing or firing Levandowski. "We can fire him and we still won't have the documents," said Gonzalez. "The courts have made clear that's the law. You cannot compel the employee to produce them [from a personal computer]." Gonzalez was asked again, why not fire Levandowski? "I concede you can fire someone," he said. "An employer is not required to threaten to fire people." More on Waymo v. Uber: On February 23, Google's Waymo division filed a lawsuit claiming that Uber's self-driving car chief, Anthony Levandowski, illegally downloaded 14,000 files when he worked at Google. On March 29, during a closed-door hearing, Levandowski's lawyer said his client would plead the Fifth to avoid testifying about documents that he may have. On April 3, Google accused Levandowski of creating "competing side businesses," even while he earned a reported $120 million from Google. On April 4, Levandowski filed a public motion invoking his 5th Amendment rights. On April 5, US District Judge William Alsup insisted that Uber search harder for the 14,000 allegedly stolen files.   Joe Mullin Joe has covered the intersection of law and technology, including the world's biggest copyright and patent battles, since 2007.

Google’s advances with its Artificial Intelligence chips, called TPUs, have helped to remove the need for it increase its data centre footprint. While fellow cloud players Amazon Web Services and Microsoft have been aggressively launching new cloud regions, supported by a mixture of newly built and collocation data centre projects, Google Cloud Platform appears to have removed this need thanks to a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Although the company already revealed plans last year to open more data centres. The project started several years ago as a way to develop a custom ASIC, application specific integrated circuit, for machine learning workloads. The TPU’s have now been in use in Google’s data centres for more than a year and are said to: ”deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning,” the company said on its blog. Benchmarks revealed by the company show that a TPU is between 15X to 30X faster than current GPUs and CPUs in the market. The company said: “The need for TPUs really emerged about six years ago, when we started using computationally expensive deep learning models in more and more places throughout our products. The computational expense of using these models had us worried. “If we considered a scenario where people use Google voice search for just three minutes a day and we ran deep neural nets for our speech recognition system on the processing units we were using, we would have had to double the number of Google data centers!” In addition to improving the speed of operation, the TPUs are said to operate at a much better energy efficiency than conventional chips, achieving 30X to 80X improvement in TOPS/Watt measure. If that wasn’t enough to make the technology sound impressive, Google said that the neural networks powering the applications require just 100 to 1500 lines of code, which is based on TensorFlow.

Google Home and Wifi will launch in the UK on April 6 for £129 each Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 3:00am PDTMar 28, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 63 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares132 Google Google Home Google Wifi News The Google Home and Google Wifi are about to land in a new country all across the ocean: the United Kingdom. After being exclusively available in the USA since their launch last year, both of Google's new gadgets will expand to their second official territory. Google made the announcement today, focusing on everything you can do with the Home and Wifi, including asking questions, playing media, and controlling your home with the former and setting up mesh networks with the latter. It also said that it has been working with several partners in the UK to bring more local apps and services to the Home and Assistant. For example, the news briefing can contain info from the BBC, The Guardian, The Financial Times, The Sun, The Telegraph, Huffington Post, Sky News, Sky Sports, and others, while the music playback can launch live radio from the BBC. There are also "a few British treats" hidden. Google says you should try asking Home about its hobbies and favorite foods. The answers should be fun and locally relevant. In addition, the Assistant support page on Google Home has been updated to say that it's now compatible with both American and British English. If you're eager to grab a Home or a Wifi in the UK, you have to wait until April 6. The Google Home will sell for £129 on the Google Store, Argos, Dixons, John Lewis, Maplin, and will later come to EE. You can also customize it with colored fabric bases (teal, orange, purple) for £18 and metal ones (white, black, copper) for £36. As for the Google Wifi, it will be sold for £129 for a 1-pack and £229 for a 2-pack from the Google Store, Argos, Dixons, John Lewis, Maplin, and will come later to Amazon. The preorder pages are up on the Google Store so you can join the waitlist and be notified when they're finally available. You can find the links below.

And make it consistent across devices. Maybe they even add the missing features that Google Now had for years. samster11 Absolutely agree with the last comment. Google Now seemed a LOT more powerful than Assistant. Matt Assistant showed up on my phone today without any tweaks to get it. UK English. Alex Ah, what phone? It's only available on my unlocked S7 Edge in the UK if I set it to US English. I've tried changing it back, but I lose it again. Matt I have an S6 Edge Linkzy I hope the British English voice feedback is improved... It sounds pretty poor on Pixel's Google Assistant in comparison to the US English voice, much smoother voice and more realistic! Liam Mulholland I think its actually £229 for a two-pack, not a three-pack uniqueuser437 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/aa2ae0853244084f88733da0fd40cb9f260cee70afc6dbc710675b7841e8003f.jpg Rita El Khoury Ah, right you are. Eager fingers thought this was a 3-pack like the US. Colin Richardson We get a price hike of about a billion percent, so making a 3 pack would be silly when they could just make us pay twice for both a 2 pack and a single.. Leeroy Jenkins FYI the waitlist has never helped me, I always get the notification days or weeks after my actual order, better just keep checking Cakefish But what about YouTube Red? Pete And podcasts. James Bray I miss my YouTube Music Key! James Bray Hopefully this will mean I get the Assistant on my Nexus 6P soon! James Bray Looking forward to trying this out alongside my echo. Google Play music makes the Home a lot more attractive, but lack of multi user support is a bit of a killer... YaKillaCJ It makes up for it by linking With Chromecast Audio/Video. Nothing like having all your music through your home in sync. James Bray I'm right in thinking there is no way to do this without a Home right? I have 2 Chromecasts, and 2 Chromecast Audios at the moment. samster11 There are 3 people in my household. Each has their own gmail account. Have Google fixed the 'issue' of identifying who is interacting with the device? I don't want my search history or music recommendations polluted by someone else's love of Christy Moore.... James Bray No, but people who have been picking apart updates have found references to voice recognition for multiple users. Coming "SoomTM".

I am surprised that no one has taken a jab at the horribly Photoshop-ed pic. obk88 when is it coming out in canada??? Alejandro García Pérez I might sound stupid but what exactly is Google Wifi? does it replace my wireless router? what are the advantages of having Google Wifi versus my already functional wifi connection? what does the device do? do I need both my router and Google wifi on to make it work?

That’s according to Peter Ferris, chief evangelist at Equinix, who made the comparison during his keynote at Data Center World Wednesday. He offered the numbers to illustrate just how real the shift of IT infrastructure from on-premise data centers to the cloud is. “Google, and Microsoft, and Amazon are each spending more than $10 billion dollars a year at this point building data centers,” he said. “Either they’re all crazy, or this transition is real and it will continue.” The figure is a reasonable approximation. Cloud providers don’t disclose their exact data center spend publicly, but at least Google and Microsoft execs have recently shared approximate figures, and they’re similar. Google’s trailing three-year capital investment is about $26.6 billion, Urs Hölzle, the company’s senior VP for technical infrastructure, said in his keynote address at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco in March. The bulk of that investment is in infrastructure. It’s not unusual for Microsoft to spend more than $2 billion on infrastructure in a single quarter. They’re spending this money to bulk up data center capacity and network bandwidth to absorb enterprise application workloads, as companies increasingly rethink the necessity of owning and operating their own data centers, and Ferris has a front-row view of this shift. Like many other data center service providers, Equinix has positioned its facilities as places where companies can connect their corporate networks directly to the networks of cloud giants. This option is more secure and provides better performance than connecting to the cloud through the public internet. Reducing operational cost isn’t the only reason companies are shifting to the cloud. Every industry is undergoing a shift to digital tools and products, and the distributed nature of hyper-scale clouds makes it easier to get those digital tool and products to their end users. Companies of all types have to rethink both their infrastructure and their business strategies in the digital world, Ferris said. “No matter what business you’re in, it’s conceivable that you will be disrupted.” More Data Center World coverage: This Hacker Can Talk His Way inside a Data Center Radware Discovers BrickerBot, a New Permanent DoS Botnet Microsoft: OCP Forced Hardware Makers to Rethink Interoperability Finding the Sweet Spot for Your Data Center Automation: Not Just for DevOps Three Reasons Network Security Policy Management is a Big Deal Previous Article Beer, Bots and Broadcasts: Companies Start Using AI in the Cloud Next Article Guarding the Guards Themselves—The Truth Behind Security Devices Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Deschutes Brewery Inc. Back in October, Deschutes Brewery Inc.’s Brian Faivre was fermenting a batch of Obsidian Stout in a massive tank. Something was amiss; the beer wasn’t fermenting at the usual temperature. Luckily, a software system triggered a warning and he fixed the problem. "We would have had to dump an entire batch," the brewmaster said. When beer is your bottom line, that's a calamity. The software that spotted the temperature anomaly is from Microsoft Corp. and it's a new type that uses a powerful form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. What makes it potentially revolutionary is that Deschutes rented the tool over the internet from Microsoft's cloud-computing service.  Day to day, Deschutes uses the system to decide when to stop one part of the brewing process and begin another, saving time while producing better beer, the company says. The Bend, Oregon-based brewer is among a growing number of enterprises using new combinations of AI tools and cloud services from Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. C-SPAN is using Amazon image-recognition to automatically identify who is in the government TV programs it broadcasts. Insurance company USAA is planning to use similar technology from Google to assess damage from car accidents and floods without sending in human insurance adjusters. The American Heart Association is using Amazon voice recognition to power a chat bot registering people for a charity walk in June. AI software used to require thousands of processors and lots of power, so only the largest technology companies and research universities could afford to use it. An early Google system cost more than $1 million and used about 1,000 computers. Deschutes has no time for such technical feats. It invests mostly in brewing tanks, not data centers. Only when Microsoft, Amazon and Google began offering AI software over the internet in recent years did these ideas seem plausible.  Amazon is the public cloud leader right now, but each company has its strengths. Democratizing access to powerful AI software is the latest battleground, and could decide which tech giant emerges as the ultimate winner in a cloud infrastructure market worth $25 billion this year, according to researcher IDC. "There's a new generation of applications that require a lot more intense data science and machine learning. There is a race for who is going to provide the tools for that," said Diego Oppenheimer, chief executive officer of Algorithmia Inc., a startup that runs a marketplace for algorithms that do some of the same things as Microsoft, Amazon and Google's technology. If the tools become widespread, they could transform work as more automation lets companies get more done with the same human work force.  C-SPAN, which runs three TV stations and five web channels, previously used a combination of closed-caption transcripts and manpower to determine when a new speaker started talking and who it was. It was so time-consuming, the network only tagged about half of the events it broadcast. C-SPAN began toying with Amazon's image-recognition cloud service the same day it launched, said Alan Cloutier, technical manager for the network's archives. Now the network is using it to match all speakers against a database it maintains of 99,000 government officials. C-SPAN plans to enter all the data into a system that will let users search its website for things like Bernie Sander's healthcare speeches or all times Devin Nunes mentions Russia.  As companies try to better analyze, optimize and predict everything from sales cycles to product development, they are trying AI techniques like deep learning, a type of machine learning that's produced impressive results in recent years. IDC expects spending on such cognitive systems and AI to grow 55 percent a year for the next five years. The cloud-based portion of that should grow even faster, IDC analyst David Schubmehl said.  "In the fullness of time deep learning will be one of the most popular workloads on EC2," said Matt Wood, Amazon Web Services' general manager for deep learning and AI, referring to its flagship cloud service, Elastic Compute Cloud. Pinterest Inc. uses Amazon's image-recognition service to let users take a picture of an item -- say a friend's shoes -- and see similar footwear. Schools in India and Tacoma, Washington, are using Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning to predict which students may drop out, and farmers in India are using it to figure out when to plant peanut crops, based on monsoon data. Johnson & Johnson is using Google's Jobs machine-learning algorithm to comb through candidates' skills, preferences, seniority and location to match job seekers to the right roles. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Google is late to the public cloud business and is using its AI experience and massive computational resources to catch up. A new "Advanced Solutions Lab" lets outside companies participate in training sessions with machine-learning experts that Google runs for its own staff. USAA was first to participate, tapping Google engineers to help construct software for the financial-services company. Heather Cox, USAA's chief technology officer, plans a multi-year deal with Google. The three leaders in the public cloud today have also made capabilities like speech and image recognition available to customers who can design apps that hook into these AI features -- Microsoft offers 25 different ones. "You can build software that is cognitive -- that can sense emotion and understand your intent, recognize speech or what’s in an image  -- and we provide all of that in the cloud so customers can use it as part of their software," said Microsoft vice president Joseph Sirosh. Amazon, in November, introduced similar tools. Rekognition tells users what's in an image, Polly converts text to human-like speech and Lex -- based on the company's popular Alexa service -- uses speech and text recognition for building conversational bots. It plans more this year. Chris Nicholson, CEO of AI company Skymind Inc., isn’t sure how large the market really is for AI in the cloud. The massive data sets some companies want to use are still mostly stored in house and it's expensive and time-consuming to move them to the cloud. It’s easier to bring the AI algorithms to the data than the other way round, he said.  Amazon's Wood disagrees, noting healthy demand for the company's Snowball appliance for transferring large amounts of information to its data centers. Interest was so high that in November Amazon introduced an 18-wheeler truck called Snowmobile that can move 100 petabytes of data. Microsoft's Sirosh said the cloud can be powerful for companies that don't want to invest in the processing power to crunch the data needed for AI-based apps.     An eSmart Systems drone inspects power lines eSmart Systems Take Norwegian power company eSmart Systems AS, which developed drones that photograph power lines. The company wrote its own algorithm to scan the images for locations that need repair. But it rents the massive computing power needed to run the software from Microsoft's Azure cloud service, CEO Knut Johansen said.  As the market grows and competition intensifies, each vendor will play to their strengths.  "Google has the most credibility based on tools they have; Microsoft is the one that will actually be able to convince the enterprises to do it; and Amazon has the advantage in that most corporate data in the cloud is in AWS," said Algorithmia's Oppenheimer. "It's anybody's game." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Linux Productivity What Is the Best Linux Cloud Service for Office Productivity? Moe Long April 6, 2017 06-04-2017 6 minutes What Is the Best Linux Cloud Service for Office Productivity? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Office productivity services remain abundant. Most Linux operating systems provide some variety of productivity software such as LibreOffice or OpenOffice in the default install. However as the onus on mobility increases, a move to the cloud is the clear trend. As such, cloud office software holds major promise — at this point, it’s almost a necessity for those working with documents. There’s no shortage of cloud office productivity services, yet they vary greatly. Moreover, picking a cloud service for Linux further narrows the quest for the best cloud productivity program. But while certain cloud providers offer easy access, some services are tailored more for writing and editing documents. Learn what is the best Linux cloud service for office productivity. Defining Office Productivity Office productivity has a very wide definition. For our purposes, we’ll define cloud office productivity as: Writing and editing documents (file types, such as ODS for spreadsheets, ODT for documents, etc., don’t matter), In the cloud. So to find the best Linux cloud service for office productivity, we’ll concentrate on applications that yield remote access to documents with writing capabilities. These services may be self-hosted or remote hosted. (If you need an offline office suite, check out these best Linux office suites.) The Best Self-Hosted Linux Cloud Service for Office Productivity What do we mean by self-hosted? Rather than a service such as Google Docs that’s ready to go, you host this variety of cloud office productivity service yourself. This requires either a server, or a cloud provider where you can set up and install your service. There are some pros, such as more customization, but a potential downside is this requires upfront configuration. ownCloud Image Credit: ownCloud ownCloud is a self-hosted ownCloud: A Cross-Platform, Self-Hosted Alternative to Dropbox & Google Calendar ownCloud: A Cross-Platform, Self-Hosted Alternative to Dropbox & Google Calendar The NSA and PRISM scares demonstrated that governments can and will access the various popular online cloud services. This means that now is one of the best times to consider creating your own cloud solution.... Read More server solution. Using this file sync service, you have access to your data via a web interface. It’s similar to Dropbox with its intuitive user interface (UI). This option comes loaded with features. In addition to file sharing, ownCloud allows you to view and edit PDFs and other office documents out-of-the-box. ownCloud sports collaborative document sharing and editing, even for users without an account. Unfortunately, ownCloud by itself is limited to editing DOC and DOCX files. There’s no spreadsheet or presentation support. However, ownCloud partnered with Collabra to deliver a cloud-based LibreOffice version. This does require a bit of setting up which might seem daunting for novice users. And unlike DropBox or Google Drive, ownCloud relies on user provided storage. So you’ll need your own server or a cloud provider for ownCloud deployment. There’s a list of officially supported ownCloud providers where you can easily deploy. Many of these even feature free hosting. But a major draw of using your own server is you’ve got as much storage space as you like. Additionally, you can use essentially any computer for hosting. Unlike a media server, you shouldn’t need a beefy CPU as you won’t be transcoding video. If you’re comfortable setting up your own server or deploying to a cloud provider, ownCloud is the best Linux cloud service for office productivity. ownCloud is cross-platform, offering desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux as well as mobile apps for Android and iOS. However, these installers are purely for client access. Hosting is only available via Linux. Why It’s Great ownCloud offers as much storage as you need. There’s an abundance of features. Notably, document editing is key as an office productivity suite. However, ownCloud also features calendar and contacts support for total sync support. There’s LibreOffice integration as well, but as a warning this is a do-it-yourself (DIY) task. The Best Remote-Hosted Linux Cloud Service for Office Productivity Don’t want to deploy a cloud service on your own server or cloud host? Try a remote hosted solution. These are more intuitive and don’t require much if any install and configuration. Zoho Docs Image Credit: Zoho Docs Zoho Docs is an excellent choice as a remote hosted cloud service for office productivity. There’s a native Linux installer, as well as sync software for macOS and Windows. Using Zoho Docs you can work on and offline and choose what you’d like to sync. As per the standard, this suite includes collaboration features for documents. In addition to desktop programs, there are mobile apps for Android and iOS to maintain cross-platform document access. For office work there’s Zoho Office Suite. It’s pretty barebones, but functions really well. There’s writer, sheet, and show: documents, spreadsheets, and presentations respectively. Neat features of Zoho Writer include version control, mail merge, and a “mark as final” option to limit future changes. My favorite aspect is the WordPress integration which allows you to simply publish documents straight from Zoho Writer. There’s a free tier which may be used by teams of up to 25 users. On this plan, each users has a 5 GB allotment, and there’s a 1 GB file upload limitation. You get Dropbox integration, Zoho Office Suite, and version control. However, versioning is only up to 25 versions. It’s comparable to Google Drive and Google Docs in some regards. But while Google Docs and Google Drive remain completely in-browser on Linux, Zoho Docs offers a desktop app for syncing files. This way you can work on your documents while offline. But Zoho Docs offers a streamlined, intuitive experience. It’s similar to Google Docs, but supports a Linux installer for syncing files. While Zoho Docs might not be as comprehensive as ownCloud, it also doesn’t require as much effort to set up. Additionally, you don’t need your own server, or to set up cloud hosting. Why It’s Great Zoho Docs is similar to Google Docs and Google Drive. Getting started is much quicker than with a service like ownCloud and doesn’t require a server or your own cloud hosting. Hey, You! Get Off My Linux Cloud Office Productivity Service! If you’re looking for a Linux cloud service for office productivity, you’ve definitely got options. Although Zoho Docs and ownCloud remain the best for remote and self-hosted solutions respectively, OnlyOffice and Google Drive are decent choices. OnlyOffice also features an excellent cloud offering. But for the remote hosted version, you do have to pay. Alternately, OnlyOffice does feature a self-hosted option which is available as a Docker image and Linux installer. While there’s not an official Google Drive Linux client, you may access it on a GNOME-based desktop. There’s a workaround which involves adding your Google account to your online accounts. Further, there’s a command-line tool for uploading and downloading files to Drive. However, this command-line tool doesn’t feature background sync. But you should overlook this, as Google Drive is one of the best cloud solutions on Linux 10 Cloud Solutions You Should Be Using on Linux 10 Cloud Solutions You Should Be Using on Linux Some mainstream cloud storage options don't offer a decent Linux client. But you're not out of luck. Many popular services do work under Linux. You can even roll out your own cloud solution! Read More . Ultimately, which service you pick depends on what you’re most comfortable with. As a homelabber, I prefer ownCloud as I’m free to host as much as I’d like. But if you’d rather eschew any server or cloud hosting configuration, you’re better off with Zoho Docs, OnlyOffice, or Google Drive.

However these lack more robust office productivity features like spreadsheets and presentation compatibility. Therefore it’s tough to recommend them as an all-in-one program.

Google says it has reduced fake Google Maps listings by 70% since 2015 Company cites machine learning and new business verification techniques as main reasons for the decline. Barry Schwartz on April 6, 2017 at 2:29 pm More Google announced that they have heard about all the Google Maps spam issues over the years and have taken several steps to reduce the fake results in Google Maps. Google said that while “fewer than 0.5 percent of local searches lead to fake listings,” they still want to reduce the chance of anyone finding a fake business on Google Maps. The new procedures have led to Google being able to detect and disable 85 percent of fake listings before they even appear on Google Maps. They also have reduced the number of abusive listings by 70 percent from their peak back in June 2015. (See chart below.) And they have reduced the number of impressions to abusive listings by 70 percent, Google said. Specific measures Google added that help drop Google Maps spam include: requiring advanced verification for select business categories, such as locksmiths and plumbers. not allowing bulk registrations at most addresses. preventing businesses from relocating impossibly far from their original address without additional verification. detecting and ignoring intentionally mangled text in address fields. adapting their anti-spam machine learning systems to detect data discrepancies common to fake or deceptive listings. Google will present the data from its report, “Pinning Down Abuse on Google Maps,” on Friday at the 2017 International World Wide Web Conference. The full report can be read online — look for the PDF download link in the upper right.

Siri is Google’s nearest mobile search competitor [Report] According to a survey from Fivesight Research, Siri had a larger share of mobile search than Bing or Yahoo. Greg Sterling on April 6, 2017 at 2:55 pm More A new study from Fivesight Research, “US Consumer Search Preferences Smartphone & Desktop: Q1 2017,” finds that Siri is the mobile “search engine” of choice after Google. The study was based on a survey of 800 US adults split roughly evenly between iOS and Android users. Google was by far the dominant mobile search engine, with an 84 percent aggregate share among respondents. Among Android users, Google’s search share was 90 percent. Among iPhone owners Google had a 78 percent share. After Google, however, Siri was named by more respondents as their “primary search engine” than Bing or Yahoo. (However, this doesn’t reflect query volume, just identification as the primary engine of choice.) Siri was the primary search engine of 13 percent of iPhone owners. This finding is significant because it suggests the long-term, potentially disruptive impact of voice and virtual assistants on traditional “query in a box” results. It’s important to point out, however, that these responses reflect self-reported data and many not line up one-to-one with behavior. Siri was also the most widely adopted virtual assistant among the available choices, used by a higher number of iOS users than “Google Now” was by Android users. Google Assistant wasn’t one of the available choices on the survey. A very large percentage of respondents (72 percent) said they were using virtual assistants to “supplement” more traditional mobile search. Only 16 percent of iPhone owners did not use a virtual assistant, while just under 40 percent of Android users did not. Among iPhone owners who used assistants other than Siri, 10 percent used Google Now, and 4 percent cited Cortana. Among Android users, 24 percent were using virtual assistants other than Google’s own, with 10 percent using Cortana and the remainder distributed across several others, including Viv. The survey also found that Chrome was the dominant mobile browser, with a 48 percent share, followed by Safari, with 37 percent. Roughly 14 percent of iPhone owners used Chrome as their primary browser. However, Android owners reported a higher level of non-Google browser use, with 11 percent choosing a Microsoft browser and another 10 percent using “other.” About The Author Greg Sterling Greg Sterling is a Contributing Editor at Search Engine Land.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated April 6, 2017 10:43AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Machine Learning Chip Processor TPU GPU CPU Data Centers Intel Nvidia Top Tech News Without its custom-designed chip for machine learning, Google might have had to build many more data centers to support the intensive computing demands of services such as Image Search, Google Photos and more. Yesterday Google revealed new performance details about its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) during a National Academy of Engineering presentation at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. It said the TPU has shown in tests that it can outperform CPUs and GPUs in data centers, enabling faster and more energy-efficient computing for complex demands. As it applied machine learning capabilities to more of its products and applications over the past several years, Google said it realized it needed to supercharge its hardware as well as its software. It launched a "stealthy" project to develop a custom accelerator, and last May revealed that it had been successfully running Tensor Processing Units in its data centers for more than a year. Faster Chip or Twice as Many Data Centers "The need for TPUs really emerged about six years ago, when we started using computationally expensive deep learning models in more and more places throughout our products," Norm Jouppi, a distinguished hardware engineer at Google, wrote yesterday on Google's Cloud Platform Blog. "The computational expense of using these models had us worried." According to Jouppi, the company calculated that Google users employing voice search for just three minutes a day would have overwhelmed existing data center processors running deep neural nets for speech recognition. Keeping up would have required Google to double its current number of data centers, he said. Google currently operates 15 major data centers around the globe, with eight located in the U.S. and the rest scattered across Europe, Asia and South America. The company launched its high-priority TPU development project with the goal of boosting computation performance in its data centers to 10 times that of existing GPUs (graphics processing units), according to a research study released by Google yesterday. Tests show the TPU is an average of 15 to 30 times faster than a contemporary, server-class Intel Haswell CPU (central processing unit) and an Nvidia K80 GPU, according to the study. Enabling Responses 'in Fractions of a Second' Google's TPU is an application-specific integrated circuit that was tailored for TensorFlow, the company's machine learning-focused, open source software library. When it announced an updated version of TensorFlow in mid-February, Google said the library is now being used in projects ranging from language translation to cancer detection. In his blog post yesterday, Jouppi said Google's first-generation TPUs "allow us to make predictions very quickly, and enable products that respond in fractions of a second." More than 70 authors contributed to the research report detailing the TPU's performance in Google's data centers. The report is scheduled to be presented this June at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture in Toronto. Jouppi noted that Google plans to provide more updates about its TPU in the coming weeks and months. "TPUs are behind every search query; they power accurate vision models that underlie products like Google Image Search, Google Photos and the Google Cloud Vision API; they underpin the groundbreaking quality improvements that Google Translate rolled out last year; and they were instrumental in Google DeepMind's victory over Lee Sedol, the first instance of a computer defeating a world champion in the ancient game of Go," he said.

MORE IN CHIPS & PROCESSORS Qualcomm Seeks FTC Suit Dismissal Employees Implanted with Microchips Apple Drops Imagination's Tech Snapdragon Chip Is Now a 'Platform' AMD Defends New Ryzen Processor Next Article > Qualcomm Asks Judge To Toss FTC's Anti-Trust Lawsuit By Mike Freeman. Updated April 05, 2017. Qualcomm is asking a judge to dismiss a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that alleges the San Diego wireless chip firm's patent licensing practices violate anti-trust laws. The company filed its motion on Monday in U.S. District Court in Northern California. It argues that the FTC fails to show that Qualcomm's licensing practices hurt competitors such as Intel and MediaTek in the cellular modem market -- a key legal hurdle when bringing an anti-monopoly case. "This failure, after more than two years of (pre-lawsuit) investigation, reflects the fact that the FTC not only has not, but cannot, plead facts stating a plausible claim of competitive harm," said Qualcomm in its dismissal motion. The FTC sued Qualcomm on Jan. 17 in the waning days of the Obama administration. Its lawsuit is one of several recent legal assaults on Qualcomm's patent licensing business model. Apple also has sued Qualcomm over patent licensing in San Diego federal court. Qualcomm is expected to file a response in court to Apple's allegations by April 10. Taiwan and Japan regulators are looking into the company's practices. And South Korea's anti-monopoly regulator fined Qualcomm more than $850 million late last year for violating that country's anti-monopoly laws. Qualcomm has appealed the fine and regulatory ruling in the Seoul High Court. Qualcomm pioneered modem technology that connects smartphones and other wireless devices to cellular networks. While the company makes the bulk of its revenue from selling semiconductors that power wireless devices, it earns most of its profit from licensing its portfolio of thousands of mobile patents. In its dismissal motion, Qualcomm says the FTC's legal theories are flawed, and it fails to provide facts that prove that Qualcomm illegally harmed competitors. "Having failed to meet even the most minimal pleading standards, the complaint should be dismissed," said Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement. Dismissal motions are common in civil lawsuits. In January when the case was filed, current acting FTC Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen opposed the commission's decision to sue Qualcomm. Some Wall Street analysts have speculated that Trump administration appointees to the FTC may not pursue the case. A phone call to the FTC media office was not returned. Qualcomm shares were up 29 cents at $56.78 in late day trading on the Nasdaq exchange. © 2017 San Diego Union-Tribune under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Google Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | April 6, 2017 1 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0               I picked up a Google Home right after it launched. I didn't necessarily have any specific intentions to do such a thing, but I walked into a Best Buy and they had so many of them just sitting there (and at a discount) that I couldn't stop myself. I wanted to check out Google Assistant, too, and Google Allo wasn't something I wanted to use on a regular basis. So I took it home, set it up, and I had a good time with the device for a little while. Being able to talk to a smart speaker and have some music start playing is pretty awesome. And watching my kids ask Assistant questions, like they've done with Siri in the past -- but without having to hijack my phone was also pretty neat. They love talking to digital personal assistants, which is just one reason why I'm glad companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others are putting so much focus on it. Adoption is only going to get better over time, so Assistant, Siri, and others only have room to grow. Unfortunately, it didn't take me long to realize that, aside from using it as a speaker, I, personally, wasn't going to use Home all that often. But I got my mom one for the holidays, and while she was against it at first she's quickly turned around on the smart speaker. She loved the thing. From playing music, to checking up on the news, and even getting a brief look at her schedule, Home helped her out a great deal. I was happy that she was happy. Last night I was curious about whether or not she was still happy with it, all these months later. After all, it is just a smart speaker, and I couldn't help but wonder if its ubiquitous nature inside her house, just another object on a desk, would mean she'd gradually stop using it. So I asked her and I was happy to find out that, yes, she's still using it all the time, and she's still happy with it. She may just be telling me what she thinks I want to hear, since I did buy it for her as a present. Hopefully she actually is really using it as much as she says. A friend of mine has an Echo in his home, and he ranted and raved about that thing for a long while. So this morning I asked him the status on the Echo -- does he still use it all the time? Interestingly enough he said he's been using Assistant on his Google Pixel XL a lot more, because he travels quite a bit, but that Amazon's Echo (and Alexa) help his own kids out quite a bit. So, while he might not be using the Echo all that often anymore, it sounds like it's still getting used a lot, which is a good thing. It got me wondering if the Echo, and Google Home, are still being used in your house as often as they were when you first got them, too. As the smart speaker just become another device in your home that you use every once in awhile? Or do you still use these things every day? Let me know!

Name: Subject: Message: Broadcom Wi-Fi SoC exploit affects many Android devices Newsby Brian Reigh11 hours ago 3 120 4 A security team from Google’s Project Zero has found several vulnerabilities on Broadcom’s Wi-Fi SoC, which affect most Android smartphones and tablets. Hackers can manipulate these vulnerabilities to gain code execution on the chip and eventually gain control of the device itself. Fortunately, the team has already worked with Broadcom to address these issues. Fortunately, the team has already worked with Broadcom to address these issues. In a two-part blog series, Google’s Project Zero team outlines the vulnerabilities presented by Broadcom’s Wi-Fi SoC, a chipset that is found inside a vast number of mobile devices: the majority of Nexus phones, most Samsung flagship devices as well as all recently-released iPhones. The team used a Nexus 6P running on Android 7.1.1 to demonstrate that while relatively complex, the Wi-Fi SoC’s security system is still susceptible to malicious exploits. Essentially, the vulnerabilities allow outsiders to remotely gain code execution on the chip and into the operating system’s kernel. By feeding Wi-Fi frames with irregular values into the target device, the team created a stack overflow in the Broadcom firmware, making an opening to run arbitrary code on it. In other words, the team was able to perform a full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction, using the said full-fledged exploit. Next: Learn the secrets of hacking Android 3 weeks ago The bottom line is that Broadcom’s Wi-Fi SoC lacked basic exploit mitigations such as stack cookies, safe unlinking, and access permission protection. However, Broadcom has worked with the Project Zero team to ensure that newer versions will utilize MPU as well as other hardware security mechanisms. According to the Project Zero blog post, Broadcom is also considering implementing exploit mitigations in future firmware versions. As explained by Gal Beniamini, the blog post doesn’t have all the small details, so if you want the full exploit with detailed instructions, you can click here.

This position was emphasized at its Business Breakfast Session, focused on Empowering Enterprises and themed, “Driving Business Productivity through Communications Solutions”. At the event, MainOne urged businesses to continually seek improvement in business productivity and operational efficiency by taking advantage of the company’s reliable connectivity and network solutions developed for businesses in Ghana. The event, which was held at the Movenpick Ambassador Hotel, Accra, was attended by Senior Level IT Managers across various market sectors and featured presentations by the Country Manager for Google’s CSquared, Ghana, Estelle Akofio-Sowah, represented by the Partner Manager, Lord Osei-Ofori and the Sales and Operations Manager, Kwaku Agbesi. In his presentation, MainOne’s Regional Business Executive, Kazeem Oladepo, highlighted the company’s products and services offering in Ghana, focusing on its coverage within Accra, Tema and immediate environs. He stressed MainOne’s partnership with infrastructure providers, such as Google’s CSquared, which supports its increasingly widespread availability of faster and more reliable internet services to users, including a host of enterprise customers in Ghana. He assured customers that MainOne has evolved from a wholesale provider into a business that is increasingly focused on supporting enterprise clients with bespoke services that helps them to meet their day-to-day IT requirements. These services include pure internet and other connectivity services, as well as value added services such as cloud computing and collocation services. He explained that the company will continue to take feedback from its customer and that the recent launch of its CBD PoP in Accra is in line with its objectives to meet increasing demand for highly efficient communications and value added services it provides. In their reaction, Google’s CSquared Partner Manager, Lord Osei-Ofori observed that his company had built over 650km of fiber infrastructure within Accra, Tema and Kumasi and plans to building more within the next few months as part of its Project Link initiative. In his words, “Project Link is about unleashing better connections across Ghana. The focus is on building better networks with greatly expanded capacity, working with partners like MainOne in building a stronger web in Africa and around the world.” In a related development during the previous week, MainOne expounded its support for the development of homegrown enterprise-led solutions as the panacea to ICT development constraints on the continent. This position was made at the Technology for Business Forum, during the 2017 edition of the Enterprise Africa Summit, hosted by the British Council and the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI). At the three-day forum co-sponsored by MainOne, representatives from government, academia, policy-makers, the private sector, (impact) investors, development partners, civil society groups and entrepreneurs from Sub-Saharan Africa and the UK gathered at the British Council and the Kempinski Hotel Gold Coast City in Accra, Ghana, to explore innovations in policy and practice in enterprise development and strategies towards strengthening entrepreneurship as a viable option for resilient development. MainOne’s General Manager (Sales) for Ghana and Francophone West Africa, Angelo Govina who spoke during a panel session discussing the theme “Making Africa Competitive in the Global Digital Economy”, highlighted the shift from traditional to digital services and noted the role of technology in enabling businesses to not only overcome traditional competition and offer newer and more exciting offers to customers, but also to stay in business. According to him, “Africa can only be competitive and provide homegrown solutions when we take advantage of available technology services that have enabled other countries. The ability of Ghanaian businesses, for example, to emerge as African technology forces is directly impacted by their ability to quickly digitize their value proposition. This is why at MainOne, we envision a connected Africa that enables indigenous businesses in their quest for improved productivity and efficiency through dedicated and reliable connectivity services.” Comments: This article has no comments yet, be the first to comment en <a href="//ghanaweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=e630eaf2b1&cb=148854474332924" ><img src="//ghanaweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537376523&cs=e630eaf2b1&cb=148854474332924" border="0" alt=""></a> GhanaWeb Self Adverts WANT A HONEST SPOUSE?

On March 1, 2017, MAXD's legal counsel and management met with Google and Flux Factory representatives to mediate the pending Attia matter. At the end of the day, no settlement agreement was reached and the parties agreed to leave settlement negotiations open while the case continues. On May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with world renowned architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive right to pursue claims on his behalf against violators of Attia's intellectual property rights. The lawsuit was filed on December 5, 2014, in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, against Google, its co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google's spinoff company Flux Factory, and senior executives of Flux alleging among other causes of action misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract. The lawsuit contends that Google and the other Defendants stole Mr. Attia's trade secrets, proprietary information, and know-how regarding a revolutionary architecture design and building process that he alone had invented, known as Engineered Architecture which Google called Genie before it changed the name to Flux. Defendants engaged Attia in 2011 to translate his architectural technology into software for a proof of concept, based on decades of his life's work with the goal of determining at that point whether to continue with full-scale development of Attia's project. The lawsuit alleges that once Attia had disclosed the trade secrets and proprietary information which Google needed to bring the technology to market, they severed ties with Attia and continued to use his technology without a license and without compensation in order to bring the technology to market without him. Google valued the project at $120 billion dollars a year. Google later spun-out the business, and the new company was renamed Flux Factory. Flux Factory is substantially funded and has grown according to an interview with one if its founders to 800 employees. Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction against the defendants, punitive damages, and restitution. As exclusive agent to Eli Attia to enforce all rights with respect to the subject technology, MAXD retained the Dallas, Texas, based law firm Buether Joe & Carpenter LLC to represent the Attia in the suit. Defendants filed multiple demurrers to the complaint, and the Court issued orders allowing the case to proceed. The parties are expected to begin the discovery phase of the litigation in early summer 2017. The case has been vigorously prosecuted, and the Company believes it has a good likelihood of success.

On March 1, 2017, MAXD's legal counsel and management met with Google and Flux Factory representatives to mediate the pending Attia matter. At the end of the day, no settlement agreement was reached and the parties agreed to leave settlement negotiations open while the case continues. On May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with world renowned architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive right to pursue claims on his behalf against violators of Attia's intellectual property rights. The lawsuit was filed on December 5, 2014, in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, against Google, its co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google's spinoff company Flux Factory, and senior executives of Flux alleging among other causes of action misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract. The lawsuit contends that Google and the other Defendants stole Mr. Attia's trade secrets, proprietary information, and know-how regarding a revolutionary architecture design and building process that he alone had invented, known as Engineered Architecture which Google called Genie before it changed the name to Flux. Defendants engaged Attia in 2011 to translate his architectural technology into software for a proof of concept, based on decades of his life's work with the goal of determining at that point whether to continue with full-scale development of Attia's project. The lawsuit alleges that once Attia had disclosed the trade secrets and proprietary information which Google needed to bring the technology to market, they severed ties with Attia and continued to use his technology without a license and without compensation in order to bring the technology to market without him. Google valued the project at $120 billion dollars a year. Google later spun-out the business, and the new company was renamed Flux Factory. Flux Factory is substantially funded and has grown according to an interview with one if its founders to 800 employees. Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction against the defendants, punitive damages, and restitution. As exclusive agent to Eli Attia to enforce all rights with respect to the subject technology, MAXD retained the Dallas, Texas, based law firm Buether Joe & Carpenter LLC to represent the Attia in the suit. Defendants filed multiple demurrers to the complaint, and the Court issued orders allowing the case to proceed. The parties are expected to begin the discovery phase of the litigation in early summer 2017. The case has been vigorously prosecuted, and the Company believes it has a good likelihood of success.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google’s former self-driving car boss Chris Urmson raises millions for startup while facing Tesla lawsuit By Ethan Baron / April 6, 2017 at 10:01 AM The feeding frenzy is on, and it’s not pretty. Amid Silicon Valley’s rush to bring self-driving cars to what’s expected to be a hugely lucrative market, undercurrents of treachery are surfacing as the fight between tech titans becomes ever more vicious. Ride-hailing giant Uber and Google’s pioneering Waymo robot-car firm are locked in a dramatic court battle over allegations that a former Googler, in Mission Impossible style, plundered Waymo of autonomous-vehicle secrets and brought them to Uber. A federal judge on April 5 warned Uber that the evidence Waymo has brought against Anthony Levandowski is the strongest he’s seen in 42 years, Reuters reported. Levandowski, who heads Uber’s autonomous vehicle program, denies the allegations, but could be barred by court order from working on the program, the judge said. And now, according to a new report, Google’s former self-driving car chief Chris Urmson has raised more than $3 million for his own “stealth” robot-vehicle startup — while facing an explosive lawsuit from Tesla. Urmson’s secretive enterprise has lured engineers away from Uber, Google, Nvidia and Tesla, news website Axios reported April 5. “Many of them self-identify on LinkedIn as working for ‘Stealthy McStartup,'” according to Axios. But Tesla is accusing Urmson and its former director of the Autopilot unit of a different kind of stealthiness. In a lawsuit filed in January, the Palo Alto-based electric car maker made claims remarkably similar to those levied by Waymo against Uber. The lawsuit makes reference to the robot-truck startup, Otto, that Levandowski sold to Uber for more than $680 million after leaving Google, and alleges that Urmson and his startup co-founder Sterling Anderson “decided to take a run at a similar fortune.” Anderson, while working at Tesla, secretly recruited Autopilot engineers for his budding enterprise with Urmson, stole hundreds of gigabytes of Tesla’s confidential data, then “doctored” his company laptop “in an attempt to conceal his misdeeds,” the lawsuit claims. None of Tesla’s allegations have been proven. It’s no surprise to see lawsuits arising from a self-driving car business that has become exceptionally cutthroat. Major players in the sector generally expect to put significant numbers of the vehicles onto public roads by 2020, raising a ticking clock over the scramble for future market share. And “shared mobility” — the ride sharing systems that are a major focus for autonomous-vehicle firms — is predicted by Morgan Stanley to become a $2.6 trillion market by 2030.   Photo: A self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan from Google spin-off Waymo (courtesy of Waymo) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Anthony Levandowski, autonomous, Chris Urmson, Google, robot, self-driving cars, Sterling Anderson, tesla, Uber, Waymo   More Posts in 1 Yahoo, with Finance and Sports, will live on after Verizon sale, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says April 5, 2017   Yahoo and AOL to get odd new name, questionable logo April 3, 2017   Uber exec accused of stealing Google’s self-driving car secrets takes the Fifth in face of possible ‘criminal action’ March 30, 2017       Share this Post Tweet               Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Pre-release Tesla Model 3 spotted near company headquarters Intel security costs rose after CEO, other execs got threats Google’s former self-driving car boss Chris Urmson… Yahoo, with Finance and Sports, will live on after Verizon… H-1B visa lottery brings truckloads of applications, new…     Archives Archives Select Month April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital   About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

View All 38 Articles In This Series Google announced Android O today (have you heard?), and one feature on the list that caught my eye was a reference to "high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs" now being supported by the OS. While Google doesn't specifically reference aptX, there really isn't much else they could be referring to. aptX is a proprietary streaming protocol owned by CSR, who are now owned by Qualcomm. Its HD variant allows more seamless playback of high-quality (i.e., high-bitrate) audio and is generally preferable to the standard Bluetooth audio streaming protocol. It also comes in several flavors, including a mode that offers very low latency, though almost every iteration of aptX offers superior latency to the standard Bluetooth A2DP specification. aptX support is explicitly hardware-dependent, so your phone or other device actually has to have the right equipment to use it, but it's become increasingly common on high-end smartphones in recent years. CSR's acquisition by Qualcomm all but guarantees you'll be seeing aptX support in more phones in the future, too. Our confidence that Google is referring to aptX is bolstered by this commit in AOSP, which specifically references the integration of aptX and aptX HD. It seems likely that's what Google is referring to above, then. If you want to know more about aptX, Qualcomm's site can tell you a bit. We've reached out to Google for a comment and will update this post as soon as we know more. Update 1: 2017/03/21 11:36am PDT Google has confirmed the aptX codec is supported in Android O. We also got this screenshot from a commenter below (thanks!) showing the aptX, aptX HD, and Sony LDAC codecs in developer options. So, this is as confirmed as it gets.

Danmheadache AptX looks cool though I just want Bluetooth 5.0 in my next phone. Good_Ole_Pinocchio S8 will have it. I don't see why 2H phones won't. Willyman With what benefits? It has zero impact on audio. vn33 Do you need new hardware (ie. speakers) to support/take advantage of aptX BT? Deeco "aptX support is explicitly hardware-dependent" Impulse_Vigil Both the phone and the Bluetooth adapter (or speaker/headphone it BT is integrated) need to support it. It's been around for quite a while tho, I remember trying it on my HTC EVO LTE like 4-5 years ago... Still not ubiquitous tho since it's always meant an added licensing and implementation cost. jesuguru Fortunately there are increasing number of adapters with aptX which work with current headphones/speakers. Example, I have the $25 Avantree Clipper with aptX, sounds even better with my earphones than plugged directly into my S7E. Looking forward to adapters and headphones/speakers with aptX-HD built-in. Good_Ole_Pinocchio WOW this is a big move by Google. Finally!...... e_hekuta the press release mentions LDAC, the competence codec from Sony Artem Russakovskii It says "such as LDAC codec" - not "only LDAC." We've asked Google to clarify this for us. trwnh Still seems weird to write the entire article about aptX when it wasn't even mentioned, while Google DID "specifically reference" LDAC. Artem Russakovskii Well, aptX and aptX HD are supported, and those are the ones that matter the most. Reverend_Yeezus "such as" meaning, optional features for manufacturers to pursue. Example: My Pixel doesn't have AptX, but does have the right hardware and OS. Ismail Akram this is confusing. if it doesn't have AptX then how it have now. that means it had capability but needed to enabled that.. Reverend_Yeezus Licensing. They didn't want to pay Qualcomm for that feature of the SoC. That's my whole point -- LDAC or AptX being in Android O dev edition means nothing, if the manufacturers opt out to save money. Ismail Akram So Pixel opt in for aptx, LDAC or not? Does Google now paying for LDAC and AptX in Android O for Pixel ? Scott Warner aptX/HD are also licensed per-device. I doubt that every device will support it out-of-the-box, but the system/framework will support it J. Gilbertson Press release mentioned LDAC. The commit, Change 318907, specifically stated, "Integration of the aptX and aptX-HD codecs for A2DP source Each of the codecs can be used if the corresponding encoding shared library is installed on the device: - aptX: libaptX.so - aptX-HD: libaptXHD.so Test: A2DP streaming to aptX and aptX-HD headsets" My guess is that there will be multiple HD bluetooth audio codecs utilized. Would make as much sense as getting a new TV with both Dolby Vision and HDR10. Cover your bases. Support the most. People will flock to you. This will be an important change for Google as Android OEMs are tempted and swayed by Apple's decision to cut out the headphone jack. They wanna be "hip" like Apple. Defenestratus Dang my QC35's don't have aptX Amit_N and those are expensive as fcuk!! Michael i'd really like google to add bluetooth battery levels. DvST8 I was so happy when I changed to LineageOS and saw it shows the bt battery level. Neel I had it on my OPO on cm14.1 and it's not on 7.1.1 on my pixel, it sucks :( Artem Russakovskii Just checked - nope, not there. Ismail Akram Have anyone testing aptX, aptX HD or LDAC on Pixel on Android O? When I plug Airpods I see ACC codec selected. I don't have any other bluetooth headset. exadeci It can't be that hard, LG has it. Teja I was about to comment this and then I saw yours. YaKillaCJ Miui, LG, OxygenOS, LOS/CM and several Roms had this built in. Google should have been done it in stock years ago. trwnh Actually, they specifically mentioned LDAC on Android Developers Blog. LDAC is a new codec from Sony. Reverend_Yeezus and freaking incredible. Night and day difference to SBC, via my MDR-1000x. Marcus Ussery Doesn't the device have to have LDAC in it to benefit? The LG V20 doesn't support LDAC. SIGTRAP Why has it taken this long? Meanwhile I've been enjoying AptX support on Samsung devices for the past 5 years. trwnh The additions definitely include LDAC and probably aptX HD, not regular aptX. Still, it could be just something OEMs added that wasn't part of AOSP before. *shrugs* Willyman Prior to Qualcomm's take-over of CSR, only CSR BT modules would support AptX. Now they're clearly making a move to expand it to a much larger user base. Impulse_Vigil It's still not AptX lossless, didn't know CSR had been aquired tho... I tried comparing them once (aptX and SBC) and to be honest I couldn't hear the difference... The caveat is that could very well be the fault of the HTC aptX adapter I was using. I don't think most people listening on car stereos or closed/mobile headphones will really benefit much. OTOH those with good OEM might, and the latency benefits are probably very tangible for videos and games. Daniel Castro aptX isn't. aptX-HD is getting closer but still not full lossless. Impulse_Vigil There is an AptX version thatis lossless from what I remember tho, not sure I've ever seen it on an actual product but I remember seeing it listed on their own site (CSR's)... Now that I'd welcome, ends the debate about SQ etc. Qub4d My Sennheiser HD1 (momentum wireless) is aptX compatible. For high-end cans, it can certainly make things sound better. Impulse_Vigil You've actually compared it on two different sources with and without aptX? (and I say two different sources only because AFAIK there's no way to turn it off or even tell it's being used, not easily, and the source shouldn't matter anyway beyond which codec is used) Genuine question btw, curious to see what your impressions were. I did say IEM were probably more instrumental to noticing a difference than your average closed headphone, decent IEM can be pretty revealing for a lot less $ (and with a lot less amplification). Qub4d I have a OnePlus 3T that I've flashed aptX codecs onto manually (search for aptX on XDA, there's a thread in the OP3 forums for it). You can check your audio codec on Android devices with logcat, either with a rooted app, or a dump over ADB. The thing to know about aptX is that it isn't a magic bullet that makes everything sound fantastic; most notably, YouTube and SD streaming services are already at 128kbit and the extra bandwidth the codec gives doesn't help. For high bitrate audio (here defined as 320 mp3 and above), it helps from what I can tell. The soundstage on my test songs (selections from deadmau5, tool, and top 40 stuff like the weeknd and T.Swift, plus the song "Berlin" by The Piano Guys) improved in perceived depth and in instrument separation was noticeably better. The sound profile on the Sennheisers is already really good even with standard Bluetooth, but aptX removed some of the "crispy" artifacts that wireless compression can create. For IEMs, I have only my Brainwavez M5s, which are wired. I do think that wired is the gold standard, and when I need it I have a wired passthrough on the Sennheisers. AptX is nice to have, though. Impulse_Vigil Thanks for sharing more info, very well informed take on it and a useful test indeed. If they do end to adding this within O I'll have to make a point of trying it out myself... Not very interested in wireless headphones myself (fintie lifespan, more crap to charge, happy with my can collection, etc) but there's gotta be a BT receiver like my old Sony MW600 which features AptX. It's hard to find decent reviews on those things tho, and so much of SQ still depends on the analog stage or amplification on it... I guess that's one upside of wireless headphones, more likely to be tuned for whatever electronics are in it (as well as more likely to be reviewed by a credible ear). I mostly use the V-Moda XS on ears on the go and I'm not sure I'd notice a big change there, would likely notice with my Ety hf3 IEM or the ER4XR I've been eyeing tho. As my skepticism in the previous comment might've hinted, I'm definitely not expecting anything close to a night and day difference, but what you described seems pretty worthwhile. It's hard to make OEM sound spacious at times. You don't think of the HD1 as IEM btw? Qub4d By HD 1, I refer to the rebranded Momentum 2.0 Wireless, specifically the over-ear variety. Impulse_Vigil Oh, apparently they have a pair of LG-style Bluetoot-IEM-on-a-collar called HD1, thought that's what you were referring to. Edit: Huh, seems they use the same designation for the OEM as well as the Momentum rebrand, that's confusing... Tho they did the same with the Momentum name I guess. Ismail Akram I've Airpods, which when I connect to Pixel XL, I see ACC codec instead of SBC, which sounds decent to my ears. but when I connect Airpods to iPhone 7+, I hear more sound more volume its more enjoying cuz of extra AMP. and when I connect those Airpods with Macbook Air the volume gets even louder. Why it sounds different on different devices? I thought all bluetooth would have at least same amount of volume but its not. Cody Lemley So my V20 can do HiFi over Bluetooth!? Please LG please! RyRyTheFunBun Already has AptX HD Cody Lemley Bull! I have tested it with my buddies Bluetooth studio monitors, was a bit stoned don't remember the model or brand. But it did not display HiFi and I tried turning it on. Unless I'm a complete moron, which is likely the case while being stoned. mattcoz Would this mean it's coming to the Pixel? The Snapdragon 821 is supposed to support it but the Pixel does not. RyRyTheFunBun So does this mean I'll no longer get a loud spike of distortion after playing music for 4hrs? AptX is broken because of this and I never hear anyone mention it. Lawstorant That's great. Since about 3 years Snapdragon = AptX support. I enabled it on my Nexus 6 and with appropriate headphones it sounds much better. Alvester Garnett How'd you acquire Apt-X on a Nexus 6? Lawstorant XDA :) alvester Thanks Ryan They finally going to finally fix the volume issue that was brought about when they went to absolute volume? matteventu Which issue is that? Ryan Absolute volume sets media to max when you connect to a volumeless reciever, causing it to sound blown out. Attempting to change volume on phone doesnt work. They put in a developer option to disable absolute volume but you cant set it. bobEveryman I know what you mean about the absolute volume, I had horrible problems with my nexus 6 and LG tone headset. Adjusting the volume on the headset would adjust the BT volume on the phone, but the lowest BT volume on the phone was too quiet for many things, and the next notch up was WAY too loud on the headset. At least that developer option allowed me to use my headphones properly again, but I guess there are other concerns when using it with those devices that don't have their own volume controls... Ryan You actually got the developer option to set? Mine just goes back to off when I exit the developer options and makes no difference. Not on my 5x, not on the Nexus 9 and not on the girlfriends 5x. Nor on my buddies 6p. I didnt think it worked for anyone. bobEveryman Well, I never actually used the developer option, but when I got the Android upgrade that introduced it, it seemed to have "broken" the linked volume, so I never actually had to touch the setting. Changing the volume on my headset ONLY changes the volume on the headset, and I generally leave the media volume on the phone at 100%.

JD I can't believe this wasn't a thing for so long Shawn Kovalchick I'm going to go the other way here. I have a 2011 Nissan Altima with bluetooth and a Pixel XL. After rebooting my phone, I usually get decent audio through the car's bluetooth connection, but after a while (phone's uptime > 12 hours), bluetooth will start chopping. The only thing that makes it better is rebooting the Pixel. Any idea if this will help at all? whispy_snippet Does the Pixel have the necessary hardware capability to have aptX enabled via the update to O? rskyline Good question /s Alvester Garnett I'm curious about this exact same question. That and LDAC. Bewear I'd say yes. I mean, even the older Nexus devices can have aptX support via LineageOS... bmg1001 I've had aptX on my Nexus 6P for months now through CM/Lineage. Glad it could come to AOSP now. All you need is a newer Bluetooth chip to use it since its a codec and not a replacement for A2DP. P. Sherman My Galaxy Note 3 has had AptX support for years. My Xperia Z2 also had it. That took a while, but will this mean Exynos phones and Mediateks would support the AptX or even Sony's own LDAC codecs as well (because I presumed Qualcomm only licensed AptX to Snapdragons.) jesuguru My Exynos Samsung devices (Note 2 previous, S7E now) support AptX. Looking forward to hopeful aptX-HD support. Jan I always thought aptX was a Snapdragon-only thing? Would be cool to see this across devices, although i find the difference not that big on the MDR-1000x. Reverend_Yeezus it's owned by Qualcomm through acquisition, any manufacturer can technically pick it up if they pay the licensing fee. Reverend_Yeezus Device manufacturers get to decide whether or not these things are included. This certainly does not mean every android device will do it -- This is especially true for LDAC, as Sony's licensing fees are nuts. Example: My AptX-less Pixel XL Parker Reed The point is Android O will add aptX to the Pixel. It's just an included library after all. The only thing stopping it before now was just manufactures deciding not to include it. Reverend_Yeezus That stuff is licensed. If they opted it out at launch, what makes you think they would suddenly add in that +? I don't mean that to be a jerk, just wondering if there is something I don't know about the Pixel's future. Parker Reed Well in the preview everything is there except the library. So yeah it could be left off in final release but it looks hopeful that this is finally aptX for all running O. Parker Reed Seems the support is there but they haven't included the required libraries 03-22 12:06:41.125 6257 6257 D a2dp_codec: createCodec: codec aptX 03-22 12:06:41.128 6257 6257 E a2dp_vendor_aptx_encoder: A2DP_VendorLoadEncoderAptx: cannot open aptX encoder library libaptX_encoder.so: dlopen failed: library "libaptX_encoder.so" not found Serolf Divad APTX is great. I simply won't buy a phone that doesn't support it. If you have an Androidwear watch it's a must, as streamed music sounds horrible without it (too many demands placed on limited Bluetooth bandwidth). Unfortunately, your speakers/headphones must also support it. That's why I bought an Aptx dongle for my Bose SoundLink mini and plug it into the Aux in. I don't use the speaker's own built in Bluetooth receiver because it won't do APTX.

Pilot photo/courtesy Santra family Help us expand our reach! Please share this article Submit a Letter to the Editor TYNGSBORO -- The 2016-2017 Doodle4Google competition officially came to a close March 31, but not before 5th-grader Rianna Santra, a student at the Academy of Notre Dame in Tyngsboro, was named one of four national finalists. Santra was named one of 53 state finalists back in February in the Doodle4Google competition, a national contest that encourages young artists to create a special logo or "doodle" for the Google search homepage. In this year's contest students were challenged to create an environmentally-positive doodle and message on the theme "What I See for the Future...." "I'm really happy and excited, and if I win then I'm going to get even more excited," the 11-year-old told The Pilot in February, after being named a state finalist. While she wasn't the competition winner, as a national finalist she was flown out to Google's headquarters in California and received a $5,000 college scholarship and a Google Chromebook. As a state finalist, she had already received an Android tablet. Cindy Boynton, director of Marketing and Communications at the Academy of Notre Dame, told The Pilot April 4 that she had been touch with Santra's father, Prosenjit Santra, who said the family flew out to California on March 30. They were told that competition had seen 130,000 entrants from across the country, and Santra was among the top five. At the headquarters, Santra had the opportunity to meet Google team members and see a demonstration of a new Google software project, as well as participate in a Q and A session with a NASA representative. In a statement, Elizabeth O'Connell, principal of the Academy of Notre Dame's Lower School, said she is impressed with the "initiative and artistic ability that Rianna demonstrated by entering the contest." "The fact that her vision for the future, as depicted in her artwork, was honored on a national level makes all of us here at the Academy of Notre Dame very proud," she continued. "We are certain that Rianna, and other students like her who share a passion for making this world more sustainable, will pave the way for a healthier future for all of us."

Users in India will have access to “over 40 million local and international hits” and — of course — will be able to access the service on Android, iOS, and the web. Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services Google says that, in India, you’ll be able to “find music by language or by your favorite Bollywood actresses and music directors, and even lets you watch their videos right in the same app.” Per the Google India blog: Listen to music in a number of different languages, from Hindi to English, Tamil to Malayalam or Kannada.  Upload up to 50,000 of your own songs, and access them from any device with your Google Account. Or try a subscription to unlock everything: offline listening and on-demand access to our full catalogue of over 40 million local and international hits. Sign up now and get a free trial on Android, iOS or the web. Google says that you’ll be able to sign up at a “discounted subscription offer” of 89 INR per month if you sign up sometime within the first 45 days. If you want to try out Google Play Music beforehand, though, you can of course choose to go with a free 30 day trial. Spotify, one of Google Play Music’s biggest competitors, isn’t yet available in India. Apple Music is, however, and is notably higher priced. Google Play Music’s intro price is 89 INR per month (its regular price is apparently 99 INR), while Apple Music starts at 120 INR per month.

This button allows you to quickly use Google Assistant in a conversation as shown bellow. As Google explained: The Google Assistant can help you share lots of information and content right in your chats, like movie showtimes, YouTube videos, or even pics of cats in hats (because why not?). So today we’re adding a shortcut to make it faster and easier to bring the Google Assistant into chats with friends. Just tap the Google Assistant icon in the compose box and your Assistant is ready to help. We told you last week that Google Allo could get new ‘quick selfie’ feature, backup & restore, ability to add stickers to photos, and other new features in a forthcoming update. And last month, Google Allo added the ability to share files in group chats. @amitfulay @juberti Is the Assistant button rolling out for everyone? :) #Allo pic.twitter.com/16k9HDxdjx — EvoWizz 🎖️ (@EvoWizz) April 6, 2017 @EvoWizz @juberti @yesno Yes :) — Amit Fulay (@amitfulay) April 6, 2017 Dylan @EvoWizz 9to5Google contributor and French Android fan!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Google updates Material Design Guidelines, releases color tool for creating palettes and testing accessibility Emil Protalinski@EPro April 6, 2017 10:01 AM Tags: Google, Material Design Google today updated its Material Design Guidelines, the living documentation of visual, interactive, and motion design guidance across its platforms and devices. At the same time, the company also launched a new color tool that aims to help developers create, share, and apply color to UI, including creating color palettes and testing accessibility. Google’s Material Design mantra was first introduced at the company’s I/O conference in June 2014. The document, which has been updated every few months, is meant to guide, as well as support and inspire, user interfaces for productivity. More specifically, the updates this month are as follows (historical changelog): Updated guidance on the Material Design color system, usability, and a brand new Color Tool for creating color palettes and testing accessibility Text fields expands on usage basics and introduces text field boxes for increasing text field discoverability Bidirectionality has added resource links to developer guidance on right-to-left (RTL) icons The color tool deserves a little bit more, err, color. You can use it to create, share, and apply color palettes to a sample UI and through components in codepen. You can also use it to evaluate the legibility of text for any color combination. Diving in a bit deeper, Google wants to highlight three features: Create color schemes that include darker and lighter variations of your primary and secondary colors. Check if text is accessible on different-colored backgrounds, as measured using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines legibility standards. Preview the look of your color scheme across a range of Material Design Components, with editable HTML, CSS, or JavaScript in Codepen. Google hopes these improvements will allow developers and designers to provide users with “a richer experience” across everything from Android to Chrome OS to the web. We should also expect Google’s own apps and services to get more color. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

He assured customers that MainOne has evolved from a wholesale provider into a business that is increasingly focused on supporting enterprise clients with bespoke services that helps them to meet their day-to-day IT requirements. These services include pure internet and other connectivity services, as well as value added services such as cloud computing and collocation services. He explained that the company will continue to take feedback from its customer and that the recent launch of its CBD PoP in Accra is in line with its objectives to meet increasing demand for highly efficient communications and value added services it provides. In their reaction, Google’s CSquared Partner Manager, Lord Osei-Ofori observed that his company had built over 650km of fiber infrastructure within Accra, Tema and Kumasi and plans to building more within the next few months as part of its Project Link initiative. In his words, “Project Link is about unleashing better connections across Ghana. The focus is on building better networks with greatly expanded capacity, working with partners like MainOne in building a stronger web in Africa and around the world.” In a related development during the previous week, MainOne expounded its support for the development of homegrown enterprise-led solutions as the panacea to ICT development constraints on the continent. This position was made at the Technology for Business Forum, during the 2017 edition of the Enterprise Africa Summit, hosted by the British Council and the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI). At the three-day forum co-sponsored by MainOne, representatives from government, academia, policy-makers, the private sector, (impact) investors, development partners, civil society groups and entrepreneurs from Sub-Saharan Africa and the UK gathered at the British Council and the Kempinski Hotel Gold Coast City in Accra, Ghana, to explore innovations in policy and practice in enterprise development and strategies towards strengthening entrepreneurship as a viable option for resilient development. MainOne’s General Manager (Sales) for Ghana and Francophone West Africa, Angelo Govina who spoke during a panel session discussing the theme “Making Africa Competitive in the Global Digital Economy”, highlighted the shift from traditional to digital services and noted the role of technology in enabling businesses to not only overcome traditional competition and offer newer and more exciting offers to customers, but also to stay in business. According to him, “Africa can only be competitive and provide homegrown solutions when we take advantage of available technology services that have enabled other countries. The ability of Ghanaian businesses, for example, to emerge as African technology forces is directly impacted by their ability to quickly digitize their value proposition. This is why at MainOne, we envision a connected Africa that enables indigenous businesses in their quest for improved productivity and efficiency through dedicated and reliable connectivity services.” Comments: This article has no comments yet, be the first to comment en <a href="//ghanaweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=e630eaf2b1&cb=148854474332924" ><img src="//ghanaweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537376523&cs=e630eaf2b1&cb=148854474332924" border="0" alt=""></a> GhanaWeb Self Adverts WANT A HONEST SPOUSE?

Aliyun App Store Confirmed To Be Distributing Pirated Android Apps, Many From Another Pirate Site Liam Spradlin Follow View All Posts 2012/09/15 2:48pm PDTSep 15, 2012 279 Plus 1 on G+ 69 Share on Facebook 1 Share on Twitter Total Shares349 Android OS Exclusives News Article Contents 1 The Clues 1.1 'Download to Computer' 1.2 Google Apps 1.3 Temple Run 1.4 Granny Smith 1.5 ROM Toolbox Pro 1.6 Endomondo Pro 1.7 The OTHER Pirate Site 2 The Confirmation 3 The Implications 4 Final Thoughts A couple of days ago, we ran a story about a circulating rumor that Google had expressed strong concerns with the launch of an Acer phone powered by Chinese Internet firm Alibaba's Aliyun OS. As the post explained, Alibaba claimed that Google had warned Acer that releasing the CloudMobile A800 could result in the search giant "terminating its Android-related cooperation and other technology licensing with [Acer]." These rather strong words led to speculation over just what the issue could be with Aliyun, and whether Google had issued the warning at all. Google quickly confirmed its stance, indicating that Aliyun was an incompatible version of Android, and one that could "weaken the ecosystem." Aliyun OS, for those wondering, is a Linux-based operating system built by Alibaba Group, China's largest Internet firm by transactions. While the OS doesn't use Dalvik, it is, for all intents and purposes, an Android clone. The OS is heavily focused on cloud storage, and at launch, Alibaba promised users 100GB of free storage space for media, files, and – of course – applications. Anxious to find more information or some clue as to what spurred Google's alleged "concerns," I began digging. A reader commented on the original story that something seemed fishy about Aliyun's app store, which evidently launched earlier this year. After doing just a bit of research, it would seem our reader had a point – Aliyun's app store appeared to be distributing Android apps scraped from the Play Store and other websites, not only downloadable to Aliyun devices as .apk files, but also provided by third parties not involved with the apps' or games' development. What's more, we've received independent confirmation from the original developers of some of these apps that they did not in fact give consent for their products to be distributed in Aliyun's app store. In this post, we'll take a quick look at some of the evidence that Aliyun is illegally distributing apps, our confirmation from developers, and what this could mean for Android, Aliyun, and piracy in general. The Clues After digging around in Aliyun's app store for a bit, I tracked down several clues to just what is going on. The following is a brief rundown of the pile of evidence. 'Download to Computer' The first clue was the set of buttons that appears in every app listing: The "download to computer" button, while sending up a red flag initially, isn't necessarily surprising on its own – after all, the standard licensing method for apps now functions in such a way as to allow the download of .apk files and simply check licensing with a server when the app runs. What's interesting here though is that in most cases, each app store requires its own type of verification. For example, while the Play Store handles licensing one way, Amazon's App Store offers different guidelines for developers submitting to the market. What this means is that .apk files submitted to Aliyun's store are, at least in some sense, tampered with to support the store's own licensing procedure (if there is one). Whether this involves cracking the existing licensing method is as yet unknown, but it doesn't bode well when we know that many of the apps' original developers are not the ones submitting the apps to Aliyun's store. The first clue I noticed to suggest that the apps were submitted by third parties was the varying app names and "Developer" or "Provider" names for each app or game. The presence of root apps, particularly those used to install custom Android recoveries and ROMs also seemed suspect given Alibaba's "virtual machine" claim. The following are a few examples of suspect apps. Google Apps First up is Google apps. Soon after Google released its statement on the Acer/Aliyun issue, Andy Rubin posted to Google+ specifically calling out the OS' incompatibility issues and the presence of Google apps which he confirmed are pirated. Considering Google's stance on Aliyun, there's zero chance the giant would provide its apps or services, but take a look at what a search for "Google Inc." turns up: The list goes on to include Google Indoor Maps Tool, Finance, Pinyin input method, Voice Search, Maps, Earth, and just about everything else Google. Temple Run Next is Temple Run. The first clue here is that the app is listed as "Temple flee" in Aliyun's store. This, however, could be chalked up to translation. What can't be attributed to poor translation is the "Provider" name – Eloquent. Temple Run was originally created by Imangi Studios, and "Eloquent" is a Provider name that shows up time and time again in Aliyun's app store, along with a few others. Next, the actual details of the app – Aliyun's listing was published August 8th, 2012, the date the Play Store's Temple Run was last updated. What's weird is that the version found here is 1.0.3, whereas Imangi's 8-28 release is version 1.0.7. Further, the app is 26368KB, which translates to roughly 25.75MB, 2.75MB heavier than Imangi's Play Store app.   Both listings contain the same promotional screenshots, but Aliyun's shots are extremely low res and – like with most of Aliyun's listings – distorted when viewed inline. Granny Smith Granny Smith, from the makers of Sprinkle, is a paid app in Google's Play Store, costing users $0.99. Its listing in Aliyun's store faces the same set of issues – this time, the Developer is listed as leiguang888 – a name that also shows up over and over, and probably doesn't translate to Mediocre (the original devs behind Granny Smith). The game was published to Aliyun September 11th under version 1.0.0, while its Play Store counterpart was updated to version 1.0.1 five days earlier on the 6th.   Again, both stores share the same promotional screenshots. ROM Toolbox Pro ROM Toolbox Pro is an especially interesting case. Given Aliyun's limited ability to even deal with Android apks in the first place, it's surprising to see an app listed that aides in the altering of system files and firmware on Android devices. As Andy Rubin stated in a post to Google+, Aliyun is not even fully "successful" at being compatible with Android apps, let alone firmware. Another interesting facet of this listing is that the Developer listing is almost right – it lists JRummy16, the Twitter handle for JRummy, the actual dev behind the app.  The version published at Aliyun is 5.0.5, published August 17th. ROM Toolbox Pro has been at version 5.2.7 in the Play Store since 9-2, and weighs 7.2MB, compared to Aliyun's version which is just over 4MB.   Again, the screenshots are the same (Aliyun's low-res answer to the Play Store's original shot), though this time the Aliyun shots feature a nearly illegible watermark for a Chinese website. Endomondo Pro Endomondo Pro, likewise lists the familiar "Endomondo" as developer, yet version 8.2.0 was published to Aliyun September 3rd 2012. The Play Store's 8.2.0 was published August 27th. The file size is on target, but this time the app's screenshots were a giveaway.   Despite the parity of version numbers between the two listings, Aliyun's listing still shows screenshots from Endomondo's old interface which was ditched back in July. We can also see that watermark again, but this time it's legible – the watermark belongs to NDUOA, another Chinese app market that openly, freely distributes pirated .apk files for paid Android apps. This is bad. The OTHER Pirate Site Nduoa is "the other pirate site" mentioned in the title of this post. Nduoa is an "alternative" Android market mainly localized for Chinese users. The site appears to be based in Shanghai and is owned by the elusive Ndoo Inc., providing thousands of free .apks (many of which would otherwise be paid) for direct download. The site even features a version of Google's Play Store cleverly named "G O O G L E Play." While one would need to have a working Chinese SIM to register for Aliyun's store, absolutely no registration is needed for Nduoa. Of course Nduoa is far from being the only international site offering free downloads of pirated apps, but it would appear that a large number of the otherwise paid apps available from Aliyun's store were yanked directly from Nduoa for the benefit of those set to use Alibaba's new Android clone. The Confirmation The first - and perhaps most important - confirmation available was found in Andy Rubin's post to Google+ I mentioned earlier, which plainly stated that Aliyun facilitated piracy: However, the fact is, Aliyun uses the Android runtime, framework, and tools. And your app store contains Android apps (including pirated Google apps). So there's really no disputing that Aliyun is based on the Android platform and takes advantage of all the hard work that's gone into that platform by the OHA. Aliyun's app store featuring pirated Google apps is, as one commenter put it, "really awkward," but in investigating this issue I wanted to confirm the suspicion that Google apps weren't the only ones illegally listed in the Android clone's web front. To that end, we asked a number of developers if they or their teams had given any form of consent for their paid apps to be distributed there. The response we've gotten so far confirms that Aliyun is distributing pirated apps, more importantly without developer permission. A member of Mediocre, the development team behind hit games like Granny Smith and Sprinkle, had this to say: This is the first time I've ever heard of Aliyun, so the answer no we had no idea that our games were available there. JRummy, the developer behind ROM Toolbox, also confirmed that his app was being distributed illegally through Aliyun, adding some insight about the impact of piracy on Android's overall ecosystem: Warez sites, like Aliyun, only hurt consumers and developers. We all know developers take a hit to their wallets but the impact we so often neglect is how piracy effects innovation. When we stop supporting developers then developers stop supporting their software. We are still waiting on confirmation from a handful of other developers, but this essentially closes the case on whether or not Aliyun is distributing apps illegally. The Implications The implications of Aliyun's app store providing what are – essentially – pirated apps are pretty big. To start with, we know that Chinese piracy accounts for a rather considerable chunk of the Android piracy pie – China is home to about 170 million Android users. Why is piracy such an issue in China? It's likely due to the fact that Google is yet to get paid apps to China in the Play Store. Whether this is due to legal issues (probably), or some other factor is unknown right now. That being said, part of the problem can also be attributed to the development and distribution of Android splinters or incompatible clones like Aliyun, which have no access to the Play Store in the first place. Either way, in this writer's opinion, the lack of an ability to pay for something does not validate the illegal distribution of that thing. Next, Aliyun's app store is, as the name implies, the app store for an entire emerging OS in China, one that is essentially a "fake" version of Android. The presence and distribution of pirated apps through the store not only makes Alibaba Group complicit to app piracy, but extends the complicity to any company who chooses to partner with the firm in bringing Aliyun OS to mobile devices and by extension to the hands of customers. In essence, the presence or emergence of an OS like Aliyun which relies on an app store filled with piracy hurts all involved with Android – first, it undermines the meaning behind the Open Handset Alliance itself. If Aliyun were to be successful, it would put off developers who find that their hard work is being carelessly distributed for free internationally. Once that happens, end users can suffer from a lack of quality apps, a poor development ecosystem, and general dissatisfaction. Though Google's statement on the recent Acer/Aliyun debacle went directly for the (extremely valid) "incompatibility" argument, the evidence presented here may compel one to think that there might have been a second reason behind Google's strong response, which itself was an almost unprecedented reaction from the Mountain View giant regarding the Open Handset Alliance and the protection of Android's ecosystem. Final Thoughts So what happens now? First, it's important to recognize that totally stomping out app piracy is a pipe dream. Jelly Bean saw the introduction of device-specific app encryption in an effort to slow piracy, but the latest available distribution numbers show that just 1.2% of Android devices (approximately 4.8 million devices) are running Jelly Bean so far. Further, existing licensing methods can be broken. As Eric explained in his analysis of the Android piracy problem, when and if Google manages to open up paid apps to China, it will still have piracy issues to face. It is unlikely that existing piracy sites and markets like Nduoa and Aliyun's app store will simply zap out of existence, and there will still be Android forks floating around with users that are willing to get a hold of Play Store apps however they can. The overall point here is that, despite the probable persistence of piracy, Google's response to Acer's proposed union with Aliyun is completely understandable – while Google may not be able to quash piracy once and for all, it recognizes that turning a blind eye while an Open Handset Alliance member releases a platform that copies Android and steals from its app and developer ecosystem is not a good starting place.

Thanks for writing this up. Flpt Well... there is blackmarket and aptoid that have pirated software also... Liam Spradlin The key difference here is that Aliyun's app store is directly espoused by Aliyun OS, which Acer planned (plans?) to release on phones despite their OHA commitments. Hal Motley This is a much bigger scale than that though because Blackmarket, Aptoid and Snappzmart are only hosting pirated apps. This is a huge corperation (Alibaba) who are a Chinese equivalent of Amazon and are making their own OS (which isn't even a true Androd distro from what I am reading) and are hosting pirated Google Play apps and games. Telerim They're one of China's largest software and web services companies (US $2.8 billion in income in 2011) and are closely backed by the Chinese regime. As Hal says, this is no mere piracy - its piracy with the backing of one of China's largest corporate giants and the Chinese regime! denbo68 Why didn't Google just SAY it was because of pirated apps? A number of critics (it isn't just me) who took Rubin's statement at face value thought this smacked of hardline tactics. Had they stated they were protecting the interests of the app developers most people would have been extremely supportive. Artem Russakovskii I'm sure it's not just the pirated apps, it's not that at all, but I'm also sure that didn't help Alibaba's case. denbo68 But it seems to be the strongest argument. Google now looks like a bully for going after Acer (and not OHA member Haier). I doubt Forbes would have written this had Google stated pirated apps as one of their reasons. http://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2012/09/14/google-cant-have-it-both-ways/ Eric Ravenscraft I can imagine Google didn't want to just come right out and say "Look, these guys are dirty, dirty thieves." That's not a good way to deal with potential business partners. They may have problems with Aliyun as is, but if Alibaba and Google could work out their differences, and Aliyun could be made more compatible with Android proper, then Google could have a valuable business partner. That's hard to do if Goog's spent its time trashing them to the press. Also, while Google definitely has a lot riding on the app ecosystem, the problems of forking Android in extremely incompatible ways is a much more pressing problem to Google. Pirated apps will always exist in any market (especially China), but multiple incompatible versions of Android don't have to. In the desktop world, we have things like Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, and about a billion other distributions, not all of which are compatible with each other. This is what Google wants to avoid. Sure, there's a "fragmentation" problem with not every Android device being perfectly up to date, but take any two ICS Android devices, even Amazon ones, and they'll be able to run the same apps. If versions of Android start popping up where that's not the case, it could be an even bigger problem. All of that being said, even if they have reasons to be more concerned with compatibility than pirated apps, and even if they don't want to insult a potential business partner too much, Google actually did come right out and say that pirated apps were a major concern. Andy Rubin specifically said this on Google+ here: https://plus.google.com/112599748506977857728/posts/hRcCi5xgayg The fact that Forbes wrote a scathing piece without understanding all the details is not Google's fault, it's Forbes. It might not be great for Google to have people misunderstanding the situation, but the fact is other people jumped to conclusions and hurried to write editorials trashing Google for it. That says far more about how Forbes operates than about Google's intentions. For example, Liam had been researching this piece since the news first broke about Aliyun. We waited to get all the relevant information together before posting. Something tells me there will always be a Forbes that's willing to jump the gun because of snap judgments no matter how Google handles the PR. PhilNelwyn Amen... Himmat Singh Honestly, I don't all this incompatible talk. "...but multiple incompatible versions of Android don't have to". If Aliyun can run Android APKs seemingly as they are, then how is Aliyun an incompatible version of Android? Surely, only compatible versions of Androids can natively run Android APK files right? Liam Spradlin That's the thing - Aliyun can't. Andy Rubin said as much in his post yesterday. When it -does- run Android apks, it's through a "virtual machine." Himmat Singh If that's the case, then Aliyun really isn't Android (their VP said as much, and ALiyun has never been marketed to run ON Android) - the fact that it can run APKs virtually is a bonus. What if Microsoft decides to allow Android apps to run via a VM - will Google take issue to it as well if say Asus manufacturers such a tablet? Liam Spradlin The difference is that Aliyun is an Android clone, but it has some fatal tweaks that keep it from being fully compatible. There's no comparison between this situation and the hypothetical one where Microsoft runs Android apps. Another difference is that Microsoft isn't running a store filled with pirated Android apps. Eric Ravenscraft Making a broken version of Android doesn't make it not-Android. And any case, that's not the problem. Acer is a member of the Open Handset Alliance. As part of that pledge, they've agreed not to encourage multiple different versions of Android that are incompatible with each other. So, no, Google wouldn't take issue with Microsoft doing this because Microsoft is not an OHA partner. As for whether or not it's compatible, the issue here is that this Android spin-off is compatible, but not fully. The OS is built on Android, but changes things in a way that would cause problems for app developers. This is not, in itself, a problem. Understand, Google isn't going after Aliyun. Alibaba is more than welcome to do whatever it wishes with Android. If it wants to make a partially-working, partially-broken version of Android with an appstore full of pirated apps, it is free to do so. What Google is taking issue with here is that Acer has pledged, as part of the OHA, to promote a consistent Android platform, yet wants to distribute devices that do the exact opposite of that. And not only to distribute insufficiently-compatible versions of Android, but to do so with an appstore that outright steals apps, including some of Google's own. Google isn't saying Alibaba can't do this. Google isn't suing Alibaba or trying to shut down the development of this OS variant. Amazon, for example, is not a member of the OHA and it is free to do with Android as it pleases. What Google is telling Acer is "look, you made a promise to work together on this, and now you're breaking that promise. Which is it gonna be? You gonna go with us, or the people who steal our apps and break our platform?" ganapat I agree with ur point , if ACER is going to market the phone as an android device having Aliyun on it...But he is going to market it as Aliyun device..As long as he is selling Android phone with OHA comaptibility he is fine.. Aliyun is another OS (regardless of whatever it is ) and that their decision to go with it.. you can't go and say to ACER don't build any windows computer as your OHA partner.. Milton Yeung What about Foxconn, supposedly still a member of OHA, manufacturing Amazon's Kindle Fires? I can't use Android widgets and can only sideload Android apps unless I decide to root the whole thing. Or does the Fire still technically meet Google's compatibility requirements? If not, then this would be a case of selective enforcement by Google. PhilNelwyn Supposedly... You'd better check next time. http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_members.html Milton Yeung So both Foxconn and Acer are listed as "Handset Manufacturers" at the OHA website, which still begs my question: why Acer but not Foxconn? One possibility is that preventing Android widgets from operating on Kindle Fire, and making it difficult to use Android apps (sideloading or rooting required) on the Fire still doesn't raise fragmentation/compatibility issues, but this doesn't make intuitive sense. PhilNelwyn Whoops... looks like I'd better check twice next time. ^^ Well, I see a clear difference: Acer would sell the device, Foxconn doesn't sell the Kindle. Would you consider the iPhone a Foxconn device? But that raises another question then: what other Foxconn activity is done "under OHA terms?" Do they sell their own devices or something? ari_free Because if they said it was piracy, Acer would be completely destroyed. Mat_t because it's NOT about the pirated apps? done in one sentence. longer version: it's about one specific thing, which they said, and rang true. You can either: run your own version of android, or run the official version - but you cannot run your own and claim it is compatible if it isn't. That's what aliyun did, and google said they would pull support if they did so. This is just showing how bad they are, and every news site who happened to believe an alleged statement is a shoddy news site as usual. József Király Chinese manufacturers never change. They are protected by the government, and international corporations can't really do anything apart from spending a lot of money to actually get to the court, and in most of the cases, the other half won't even show up. Same is the problem with the actual Android device releasers. Most of them does not give a crap about licensing, just makes a half-ass Android port (and yes, there are still devices released with GINGERBREAD), what barely, but works, then the buyer can go anywhere with their problems, they won't reply. Oh and did I mention, they usually won't even release proper sources for the kernel, or other GPL covered contents! A great example is Urbetter: we've been fighting them for the source codes for years, not just the kernel, but their modified u-boot bootloader too. Or, Rockchip: Google gave them the permission to use their services and applications on the RK3066 platform (they passed the CTS test), yet they refuse to release the kernel source code. Problem is, that while Rockchip makes the SoC, and the boards, the final device is often made by another manufacturer, then another one buys the OEM devices and rebrands them, and so on. So it's impossible to track them down. With my example: RockChip makes the RK3066 SoC, the board, basically every electronics. Then another manufacturer (in this case, the Cube corporation, http://51cube.net/) puts the whole tablet together, with the screen, chassis, etc., boxes, and sells them. I got my tablet for development from Cube, and of course I asked them about the kernel sources. They told me they do not do any development, and for every request, I should go to Rockchip. They did not say too much, but at least replied fast, and were kind in response. So, I wrote to RockChip, on their tech support line. Got an answer, two weeks after sending my message, that they are only releasing documentations and sources to partners. And guess who're the partners? Of course the companies who order 1000's of boards. So no luck with them, can't enforce GPL in any way, and this is sad. This Alibaba stuff also smells. Different package size, manipulative uploads, etcetera. Seems to be another way of the Chinese Great Firewall, watching people, listening to everyone, storing every info. And of course, Google knew about these risks, probably this is the reason they did not let Acer get involved with this "new OS". Actually, I'm yet to find a chinese device, what has no built-in tapping code. ZTE released the Blade with included code what can be easily used for surveillance, even from the other half of the world, and kept these in the updates, till the last, 2.3 release. Huawei had the same in the early models, I'm not sure about the new ones. And I could go on and on about it. Of course, the application rip-off is outrageous. Chinese manufacturers are all ego when someone accidentally breaks their licensing, yet they won't keep themselves to it. A big company distributing warez actually causes more damage than torrent sites, or similar. Why? Because these corporations have agreements with the government. Meaning, they distribute the apps in China, only them (!!), and Google Play Store is blocked. Meaning, that even if the user wanted to buy it, he or she is FORCED to warez it. And the worst part is, that the developers can't do anything. Sure, they can implement a license checking method apart from Google's, but it would be simply a PITA, not to mention the users' discomfort. Something has to be done, and it won't be easy, it will need the cooperation of all members who are damaged by this, including Google. Mat_t if you believe the mindset that chinese manufacturers steal, then you are just as much a part of the "problem" as they are - in fact, responding in the same style as the MPAA/RIAA. Their culture simply doesn't hoard ideas and act as if they own them. As a result, they're more competitive and we tend to fall behind. Something does NOT have to be done. It will need people to reach out to the chinese manufacturers, and educate them in how google is happy to work with them - as long as they're willing to do so. At the end of the day, ignorance such as even labeling this as "chinese manufacturers" is just as much a contributor to the problem as the supposed thieves as well. József Király My problem isn't the way they "steal" ideas, and I never said so. My problem is, with them, that they don't respect their own ideals! Like I said: most of the manufacturers take the GPL-covered Linux kernel, modify it for a given board, then only release the binary. Sometimes they release a few bits of source code, let's say, under Apache, but when a developer modifies the code, and releases something based on it, they demand the developer to release the code. A great example is the case with the RockChip-tools. They got leaked, got no restrictive license, but when a guy made some performance modifications, tools based on them, etc, RockChip was all crazy about the guy, threatening him with a lot of things. Also, here's the source code (he later released the code): http://gitorious.org/rockchip-android/tools Check the licensing in the headers of a few files! Basically my problem is, that they think they are over everything. If they break the license, it's not a problem, but if anyone else does, then... you can see. David Ruddock But the thing is, Google isn't happy to work with most of them. Far too many of these companies do things like turn a blind eye to piracy just to make a buck. I'm not saying their reasons for doing so aren't understandable, but Google isn't going to work with any company shipping devices with app stores that have pirated apps on them. And they have every reason not to. The real problem is what Jozsef has alluded to: the Chinese government. Want the Play Store in China? Can't have it, restrictions of internet content and speech. Want Google Search? Can't have it. Want Gmail? Can't have it. Maps? Nope. Unless you're selling hardware outside China, you simply can't ever get these things on your products legitimately. I feel bad for the plight of these manufacturers, because they'd so obviously be willing to get on board with the OHA if it would actually help them in some way. But the most key parts of building a good Android experience have nothing to do with the Android operating system. Google's services drive demand for Android far more than most people are willing to admit. Without those key Google products, the Play Store especially, these companies can't be competitive unless they resort to less savory means, like we're seeing here. Does it make what they're doing right? Absolutely not, and they deserve to be shunned for it. And so, Google is doing what it can: threatening to blackball legitimate Android partners who think about getting involved with these fly-by-night Chinese knockoffs. Google hopes that this will send the message to the Chinese government that it's been trying to push for years: if you don't open up, don't expect our cooperation. tylerwatt12 I wonder if Acer was aware of this. if so Google's action is completely legitimate. gapps aren't FOSS only AOSP is. Mat_t basically, this issue was a whole lot of nothing, compacted by media not fact checking anything. If you read the initial sources you hear "Alleged comments" or "according to (company)"...yet the company was aliyun and not acer or google. So people immediately started off speculating from the get-go. Every site that reported the initial comments should now be shamed for the poor reporting that resulted in this mess. Not that all the sites aren't worth reading, but that all the sites did a horrible job at being news sites. Joe Simpson It wouldn't be so bad if they just contributed their efforts to AOSP instead of breaking Android (their version at least) and didn't do this pirating shit. Stephen Long How does their OS run all of these apps without Dalvik? jbo1018 I think that's kind of Google's whole point. Liam Spradlin According to Andy Rubin, not well. triangle8 Nice article. Someone needs to translate it into Chinese so that people there understand the situation. Telerim Did you guys see the replies to Andy Rubin's first Google+ post on this topic? *Chinese* users are saying things like: "As a Chinese, I don't support Aliyun OS" "As a Chinese, I will never buy that Ali-s***", "aliyun is s***, as a chinese". Its hilarious - https://plus.google.com/112599748506977857728/posts/H7eC4uaJ12Q! I suspect that Aliyun OS was propped up by the Chinese regime to get back at Google, and allow for a censored version of Android in China. mduran1023 Great work Liam! Telerim Thanks for this fantastic article and great piece of work. FYI, Angry Birds Space is also pirated - http://apps.aliyun.com/detail.htm?id=22473&from_keyword=%B7%DF%C5%AD&from_page=1 . Same leiguang888, and same screenshots as Google Play. I've also written to The Verge and Ars Technica editors to let them know of this post - you do better investigative reporting than those guys! Himmat Singh "Either way, in this writer's opinion, the lack of an ability to pay for something does not validate the illegal distribution of that thing." Come on, you can't speak on this matter, can you? It's easy for you to be in America and say that from your comfy couch...but if I were in China or anywhere else where paid apps were not legally available, I think distributing/using the apps would be all right. Just imagine if you were an Android enthusiast but in China and cannot legally pay for ANY app...then how>? Liam Spradlin I can absolutely speak to this matter (as can anyone). Without restating myself verbatim, whether someone CAN pay for something has nothing to do with whether they should distribute/receive it for free. ari_free People aren't entitled to get everything they want. If you can't get something by the rules then you try to get something else by the rules. Göran Sävström And Acer said they wanted to continue down this particular road? - I'd say that Google's reaction wasn't that tough after all... If it were up to me I'd make sure Acer never made an Android device again... Ever! pepoluan You know, I strongly suspect Aliyun OS is just Android, but with additional code to steal data and/or perform remote invasive monitoring. They don't want to call it Android because they don't want to release the source code. Of course, my opinion is totally a hypothesis. goldenscreen Found other rooted apps - Titanium Backup, Mobile Odin, SuperSU, Cerberus, Tasker. Oh my. And yeah all with watermarked screenshots leading NDUOA. Billy_Joe_Bob NO MORE Acer products in my home! ari_free The sad thing is that there are people who are now against Google because they didn't see this article. They think google is just upset that there's competition. Atomic Why are the screenshots taken at the same time? ProbablyDrew Thanks for investigating this matter. There have been a lot of stories framing this as "Google is being evil and trying to stomp out competing os'es just like Microsoft and Apple" but none of them bothered to mention: 1. This is not independantly developed, it is all based on Android. 2. They are distributing Google Apps and connecting to Google's services without a license 3. They appear to be distributing Android OS open source code without any mention of the Apache license, which is required for derivative code (I can't find a mention of it searching the aliyunos website). 4. They are distributing private developer's apps without permission and presumably without giving them a cut of the revenue. Keshin Understandable? Aliyun can no more be held responsible for the pirated apps on their store than Google can on theirs. There are plenty of pirated applications on both stores, it's the nature of the self-publishing beast and honestly it's extremely hypocritical of Google to point out all the pirated applications on Aliyun while gleefully ignoring the fact that the Play store suffers from the same exact issue. Liam Spradlin Can you provide some examples of pirated apps on the Play Store? I'm curious to see what you mean, because personally I've never encountered one. Also I think the difference here is that Aliyun is distributing pirated apps not just from independent developers but also apps that Google created (Maps, Voice Search, Translate, Earth, etc etc), essentially providing fake copies of Google services that Google would never agree to have connected to the Aliyun OS. Jop Just search for "emulator" on the Play Store. ...Or was that not the case yet in 2012? Pedro Take your pills 1st, and then try to retype your opinion. You'll see that you will make much more sense then :) Bruno Pedro awesome article Marc Under the moniker of 'Kandee', I found 2 Angry Birds, Cut the Rope and 2 Fruit Ninjas in their appstore. The latter even being the 'full version' (according to Google Translate, my Chinese isn't that good). See for yourself: http://apps.aliyun.com/search.htm?keyWord=kandee kroms Yup ,like that's exactly what we need . A site that puts out Pirated Apps. I don't think so. Brad Prichard Just a wonderful article. I live and work in China, and this is more or less typical business ethics, but the fact that this is the Alibaba Group makes it much more concerning. My company makes some iPhone apps, and we've more or less given up on making any money from the domestic market. Selling content for any platform here is a fool's errand, and considering how little the government cares to protect intellectual property, the situation won't be changing in the foreseeable future. Trying to have a conversation with the average pirate here is about the same as discussing Napster with a 14 year old back in the day. There is just no concept that people should pay for software (or music or books). Amos Becker Batto I find Google's stance on these issues to be morally bankrupt when it comes to intellectual property issues. Google takes source code for the Linux kernel and modifies it, but does very little work to try to incorporate its code changes back into the mainline kernel, so it causes fragmentation of the Linux kernel. Then, Google complains when others take their code and make modifications and cause fragmentation of Android. Sun (now Oracle) developed Java and have been trying to stop its fragmentation. Google created their own Java virtual machine and created an incompatible version of Java which fragments the Java developer community, then Google turns around and accuses a couple Chinese companies of fragmenting Android when they make incompatible versions of Android. Google takes GPL software from the community (Linux kernel, MySQL, etc) and heavily modifies it to run its server farms and search engine, but never releases its changes back to the community. Google uses GPL software to make billions of dollars from GPL, but then it spurns the ideals of the Free Software Foundation and encourages developers to not use GPL licences. In fact it deliberately undermines the mission of the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative by confusing the public about whether software is free (as in beer) or free (as in speech) in its Play Store, so that people don't know whether they are using free/open source software or not. Finally, Google wants the Chinese to pay for Android apps, but it doesn't offer the Play Store in China. Moreover, the terms of service for its Play Store makes it illegal for anyone else to copy apps from its Play Store to serve the Chinese market. The Chinese build most of the Android devices for the rest of the world, but Google doesn't give the Chinese a way to legally obtain most of the Android apps. Then Google complains when a Chinese company finds a way to give people the software illegally, because there is no other way to get it legally through Google. (Yes, I know that a Chinese company could contact thousands of app developers and set up an alternative play store, but many Western banks won't accept Chinese credit/debit cards and many Chinese don't even have credit/debit cards, which is probably why Google doesn't bother with the Chinese market.) c933103 China's situation: 1.China government spy on gmail, so Google quit China. (As a side note, some said, NSA also spy on Google's service, then why don't google quit USA?) 2.Because Google quited China, there're no google's verification center in China that's still operating, and thus manufacturer cannot get OHA's verification, which is the prerequisite of installing GMS onto phones, despite some of them are OHA member, and some of them ship phones with GMS outside China. 3.Also, even if some pirated android tablet or some customers install GMS by themselves, because Google no longer operate inside China, their services frequently become inaccessible in China and cost devices a significant amount of battery to try to reconnect to Google's server 4.And for paid apps, there's sth more. Few years ago, Google did attempted to accept payment from mainland China by cooperating with a local partner, but because they lack a certain license that's needed to receive online payment which Apple successfully obtained (probably because Google had ceased their operation in China), their local partner are forced to terminate the cooperation. And Google can't just accept Visa/Master card/paypal payment because they are not common in China which they have China Unionpay as an national variety to these.

Read More , and for saving quick voice memos Why You Should Use Google Keep for Voice Notes Why You Should Use Google Keep for Voice Notes Most note-taking apps support voice memos as a way to dictate notes, but there's a good reason why you should prefer to use Google Keep. Read More . At its core, it’s a super simple app that can be adapted for a variety of uses. But in its simplest form, Google Keep is great for making lists. First, what exactly is Google Keep? Google’s multi-platform note-taking app makes it easy to save text, voice, and photo notes on your phone or computer. It has a variety of organization and sharing features, has some impressive OCR features 10 Creative Ways to Use Google Keep Every Day 10 Creative Ways to Use Google Keep Every Day Google Keep is a simple note-taking app. But its simplicity hides its usefulness. Here are ten tips and ideas to use Google Keep for the little everyday things in life. Read More , and takes advantage of location awareness. At a glance, it looks like a digitized version of post-it notes. To see a brief intro to the app, check out the video below: So why use Google Keep for your list-making? Here are a few reasons. 1. It’s Super Easy to Create Checklists When it comes to creating lists in Google Keep, the easiest way to do this is by creating a checklist. When you create a new note, be sure to do so by hitting the checklist button. This will insert one checkbox in your list and as you add more items to the list, more checkboxes will show up. If you’ve started creating a list and realize after the fact that you want to add checkboxes, select the text, click the More button (three dots) and click Show Checkboxes. After all, while creating lists can be super satisfying, it’s nowhere near as satisfying as when you get to check items you’ve completed off the list. You can also rearrange items on your checklist, and when you check items off, they are still viewable so you can keep track of your progress. 2. Create Checklists From Your Homescreen You can get widgets for both Android and iOS, giving you quick access to creating lists on Keep. Android users can add a widget to their home screen making it easy to create a new checklist. iOS users can add a similar widget to the Today tab, which is accessible from the phone’s lock screen and notification center. 3. You Can Keep Your Lists Organized If you don’t take advantage of Google Keep’s organization features, your lists can quickly become an unwieldy mess. Luckily, those features are surprisingly robust. At first glance, you might not realize that these features exist. Color Coding — You can color code your list (you’ll just have to keep a note of your color coding scheme) right within Keep. Color coding your lists means the entire background of your note will change to that color. This is extremely useful when looking at your list of notes, so you can see the categories at a glance. Labels — You can tag your lists using Google Keep’s Labels feature. You can then filter your notes to view only those that are labeled a certain way. These labels will be viewable in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen. To add labels to a note, open up the note, hit the More button and select Add label. Google encourages you to use the hashtag (#) symbol to organize your labels. This is fine if you want to click labels, but it isn’t very useful if you actually want to conduct a search 4 Google Keep Tips And Tricks For Better Notes, Lists And To-Dos 4 Google Keep Tips And Tricks For Better Notes, Lists And To-Dos Read More . Instead, choose a letter to prefix your labels with a “q” instead. For example, don’t use #MakeUseOf. Instead, use “qMakeUseOf.” This way, search results will be relevant, and won’t be swamped with notes that aren’t included under that label. Archiving — If your list of lists is getting far too long and you need to do some spring cleaning in Google Keep, instead of deleting them, why not archive them. This keeps your Google Keep notes tidy, but also preserves a record of your notes. (And of course if you’ve labeled your lists, you can easily search your archived notes.) 4. It’s Integrated With Google If you’re a fan of Google products, Google Keep fits right in with them. You don’t have to create a new account to use the service — just log in with your Google credentials. You can also copy Google Keep lists to Google Docs. Click the More button and select Copy to Google Doc. Unfortunately, the checklist is converted into a bulleted list, but at least it maintains its hierarchy. 5. It Offers Seamless Cross-Platform Apps Because Google Keep is multi-platform, it means anyone can use it seamlessly across devices. Google Keep is available as a free app for iOS, Android, Chrome, and as a Chrome extension. And if you aren’t a fan of Chrome, you can use Keep in any browser. Multi-platform access is something we now expect from our favorite apps. With Google Keep’s collaboration features, it’s essential that users are able to access the service on the most popular platforms. Google Keep’s multi-platform access is particularly seamless in that the interface and experience (with the exception of some features) is near identical on every device. 6. You Can Collaborate With Others Google Keep is a great app to use by yourself, but its sharing and collaboration features make it a great option for those looking for a way to share lists, notes, and more with family, friends, or colleagues. And because of its seamless, multi-platform user interface, it’s easy to get everyone on board using Google Keep. Because of its simplicity, this is particularly useful for using it with family members who are technophobic. The collaboration features are extremely simple too. You can invite “collaborators” to individual notes. Just open up a note, click the profile icon, and enter the person’s email address. You can use this to share grocery lists, prep lists for travel, or a to-do list for a simple project. It would be useful if Google made it possible to share notes based on label or color-coding because as is, the sharing feature is somewhat barebones. 7. Let Google Keep Remind You While Shopping Google Keep not only includes reminders based on a specific date and time but can even remind you of a specific list at a specific location. When adding a reminder to your note by clicking or tapping the hand icon and clicking Pick Place. You can then either allow your browser or phone to detect your location or enter a specific address. This feature is particularly useful when you’re heading to the grocery store and want to make sure that you remember to stick to your shopping list 7 Tips for Taking Better Notes in Google Keep for Android 7 Tips for Taking Better Notes in Google Keep for Android If you use Google Keep for Android, these tips will make your experience a much better one.

Otherwise its a great App. Chris Reply HildyJ April 7, 2017 at 12:09 am While I find Keep very useful for small things like shared shopping lists, the biggest problem I have is that it's navigation is not phone friendly. Given the limited screen of a phone, I have requested, through feedback and forums, that "show titles only" be an option. Think of how much less useful Calendar would be if it insisted on displaying event details in its lists instead of just the event title.

Name: Subject: Message: How stable is the first Android O Developer Preview? Features Newsby Jimmy Westenberg13 hours ago 9 237 7 A little over a week ago, Google officially announced the next major version of Android. With a new take on notifications, enhanced Bluetooth audio, a redesigned Settings menu and a whole lot more, Android O is shaping up to be quite a release. If all that sounds good to you, you can try it out right now! Alongside the announcement of Android O, Google also released the first developer preview of the new Android version. Everything new in Android O: features and changes How to flash Android O on your Nexus or Pixel But you should know that this is called a “developer preview” for a reason. Google made sure to mention in its announcement post that this first preview is for developers only, and not intended for daily or consumer use. The company isn’t even making it available in the Android Beta Program yet; you’ll have to flash the image manually if you want to give it a shot. So, should you flash Android O on your Pixel or Nexus device? After using the first developer preview for a little over a week, we’ve decided to recount our experiences to help you decide. Kris Carlon Since I wrote the Android O features post I have only been using the O preview intermittently, so I can’t definitively say if I think it’s daily driver material or not. But what I can say is that in the time I’ve been using it, I’ve not seen any more instability or erratic behavior than I would on any stable version of Android. Of course, more frequent flyers might have varying mileage. Lesson learned: don't flash a dev preview on a phone you need overseas One thing that did crop up recently was Project Fi not picking up cellular coverage on a work trip to another country. I’d had Fi working fine on the dev preview before, but for the life of me I couldn’t get it going on that trip, despite repeated attempts. Oddly enough, once I returned home everything started working fine again. Lesson learned: don’t flash a dev preview on a phone you need overseas. I’ve had lots of issues with lock screen notifications showing up reliably though, so if that’s an essential feature for you, stay away. Plenty of apps aren’t supported yet and those that are are temperamental. A lot of other background changes aren’t plugged in properly yet either, so I can’t tell you how “good” they are. I don’t mind the reconfigured Settings menu and other minor changes because they are what they are: if they arrive in Android O I’ll adapt. Easily my favorite thing in Android O though is the ability to add additional soft keys to the nav bar. I’ve long been appalled at Android’s inability to be more precise when moving a cursor in some text to fix a spelling error or whatnot. Apple’s solution has historically been much better, but that’s all going to change in Android O. Just enable the System UI Tuner, go to Navigation bar and add an extra left button with keycode 21 and an extra right button with keycode 22. Give them left and right arrow icons and you now have the most accurate cursor mover imaginable, and it lives down in the keyboard area so you don’t have to stop typing and awkwardly jab at the top of the screen whenever you need to correct a typo. It may seem like no big deal but trust me, set it up and it’ll soon be your favorite feature too. As I said in the new features roundup, if you have a compatible device you should absolutely flash it to see things for yourself before Google starts retracting them in the next preview. But if you only have one Pixel or Nexus I wouldn’t bother. Watch Joe’s great quick look at Android O on YouTube and wait for things to hit the beta program. Because even if I’ve found the first dev preview to be pretty stable on the occasions I’ve used it for extended periods of time, I can easily switch to another phone in a crisis. If you can’t do the same thing it’s definitely not worth it. The last thing you want is to be stranded somewhere with a malfunctioning dev preview and no way to flash a stable ROM. Joe Hindy Android O is a decent experience so far. Despite the many warnings from Google developers, the preview is surprisingly stable. However, I have run into the occasional app that doesn’t want to play nice. Additionally, there are some things around the OS that just mess up from time to time. However, once you get passed these, everything feels kind of like it should. It’s not too different from Nougat and most of the core functions work the same way. Despite the warnings from Google developers, I've found the preview to be surprisingly stable Of course, a lot of the upcoming features haven’t been added yet so there is still a lot left to play with. I’m looking forward to the next couple of developer previews. They should clear up some of these stability issues. The battery life has been good, if that counts. Good stuff, Google, but I’m more excited about tomorrow than today. Dane O’Leary When a new version of Android comes out, I expect to have one of two reactions: Either I’m taken aback by how different it is (á la Lollipop to Marshmallow) or I’m largely and disappointingly underwhelmed by the incremental changes (Marshmallow to Nougat). In other words, there’s a spectrum ranging from anxious anticipation to an anticlimactic letdown. In the case of the Android O Developer Preview, I’ve landed somewhere in-between. On the surface, O looks virtually indistinguishable from N, which reiterated the Material Design aesthetic we first saw in Lollipop and Marshmallow. So I couldn’t help but be disappointed that the style of Android O is “so last season”. However, once that initial disappointment subsided, I came to really appreciate the subtle tweaks and enhancements that are woven throughout the operating system. Perhaps my biggest problem happens to also be one of the biggest changes in Android O, which is—at least for me—the Settings menu revamp. It’s always frustrating when Google changes the Settings menu because you end up aimlessly wandering in and out of pages of menus to find what it is you’re looking for. While the new setup is certainly more organized, I can’t help but feel like Android O puts more menus between me and my destination. Personally, I quite liked how Settings was oriented in Nougat. Personally, I quite liked how Settings was oriented in Nougat As far as what I like about Android Oreo (wishful thinking?), I’m liking the added customization options that, admittedly, some third-party OEMs have offered users for several years at this point. For instance, the custom lock screen shortcuts I wrote about previously could potentially be a godsend. I should also mention the System UI Tuner, which facilitates the custom lock screen shortcuts and somehow feels more ‘official’ in lieu of making me feel like I need to hack my phone to unlock a secret menu. But arguably my favorite change Android O brings is the introduction of advanced codecs such as Sony’s LDAC, Google’s own AAudio API, and Qualcomm’s aptX and aptX HD; in short, audio streamed via Bluetooth will be exponentially better. Although I wouldn’t exactly call myself an audiophile per say, I do appreciate high-quality music and can say these changes make a difference. See also: Bluetooth audio just got a lot better with Android O 2 weeks ago Interestingly, one of my most-anticipated Android O features happens to be one of the least exciting, and that’s the new adaptive icons. Any Android user can sympathize with the frustrating that results from all your apps’ icons being different shapes and sizes. For the OCD among us, I can only imagine the palpitations induced by opening the app drawer. Although this is something that developers and OEMs will have to adopt, making icons adaptive means that we’re approaching a time when our app icons have the harmonious uniformity of iOS, making Android a much cleaner-looking OS. Again, it’s not the sexiest feature, but I welcome it with open arms. Picture-in-picture support could be a game-changer, too. Until now, this is something we’ve only seen in YouTube — unless, of course, your device is made by Samsung. It will be so boss to start a video and have it playing in a window overlay while you continue to use other apps. Although split-screen support is great, this is the kind of multitasking I’ve been waiting for. Virtually all of the changes implemented in Android O either revolve around the new Settings menu or are background enhancements. At least for now, moving from Nougat to O isn’t going to blow minds unless you’re someone who’s been eager for lock screen shortcuts and high-quality Bluetooth audio. But even bigger than the tweaks and enhancements is the potential for Android O to change how you use Android with features like picture-in-picture mode, better password management, and improved peripheral support. And this is only the first Android O Developer Preview, so we’ll have to wait and see if we get anymore new features as Android O is polished and improved. Jimmy Westenberg I’ve been using Android O on my Nexus 6P since the day after it arrived, and I’ve actually been really surprised with the stability thus far. I haven’t been using it as my daily driver, but I have been using it every day to check up on social networks, message coworkers and respond to emails. As far as stability is concerned, I haven’t actually had any applications force close on me, aside from the Settings menu every once in awhile. My 6P can still handle pretty much anything you throw at it, including graphic-intensive games, frequent multitasking, etc. One thing that has been pretty bad though is battery life. Unsurprisingly, battery life is pretty atrocious with this first developer preview. Now, since the stable release of Android 7.1.1 absolutely killed the battery on my Nexus 6P, prior to this I was only getting about three hours of screen on time. Now I’m getting about 2.5 hours of screen on time with Android O, but it will get better. This is an early release, after all, and I have faith that Google’s new background limits in apps will help with battery life in later builds. See also: Android O promises to improve battery life with background limits on apps 2 weeks ago Since a lot of the new features and improvements are behind-the-scenes, I’d have to say my favorite new thing in Android O is the new Settings menu. It’s been awhile since Android has seen a Settings menu redesign. While it’s not the most game changing improvement in this release, it’s still quite refreshing. Anything that Google can do to improve battery consumption is fine in my book I also like the new way Android handles notifications, particularly when it comes to snoozing and grouping by category. The ability to snooze individual notifications is a long-overdue feature, and notification channels will undoubtedly do wonders for keeping your notification shade clean and uncluttered. As far as under-the-hood stuff is concerned, I’m really excited for the new background limits for applications. Aside from my Mate 9, battery life has been a huge frustration for me in recent months, both with the Nexus 6P and HTC 10. So anything that Google can do to improve battery consumption is fine in my book. I can’t tell you that I’ve had a bad experience with this preview, but I can tell you my philosophy on these types of updates. I’m not planning on putting my SIM in the Nexus 6P until the preview at least comes to the Android Beta Program. Also, even though I haven’t complained much about stability, I still wouldn’t trust it to handle navigation in Google Maps or something that I really rely on. All in all, this is a surprisingly stable developer preview so far, and I can’t wait to see what changes Google makes in the next preview. Want to learn more about Android O?

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: News Meningitis, autism top searches on Google Published April 6, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Nigerians last week searched on Google for information related to meningitis and autism, apparently due to reported cases of meningitis, an official said on Thursday. Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, Mr. Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, made this known in a statement in Lagos. The manager said that meningitis outbreak in Nigeria got many people using Google Search to find out more information about the disease. According to him, the one-week search ended on April 5. “The rise in the number of deaths and the Buhari Support Group Centre’s decision to embark on a sensitisation campaign across states affected by the outbreak got people searching for the disease online. “It has search phrases such as, `meningitis outbreak in Nigeria’, `cause of meningitis’, `meningitis outbreak’ and `how to prevent meningitis,’’ the manager said. According to Kola-Ogunlade, parents are advised to seek early medical help against diseases. “Programmes Manager at the Ike Foundation for Autism, Mr. Joshua Anav, on April 3, in Abuja, advised parents to seek medical assistance as early as possible. “This is to prevent full development of autism in toddlers, and as such, many Nigerians have gone onto Google to search for more information about autism. “Nigerians went to search for information using search terms such as `Fewa Otedola’, `meaning of autism’, and `Autistic child,’’ he said. He said that Nigerians also searched for information on Big Brother Nigeria and weekend sports. “Some Nigerians are more concerned about Big Brother Nigeria and the weekend sports, which included the Barcelona match against Granada, than autism or meningitis,’’ he said. He noted that Big Brother Nigeria’s Sunday night eviction show usually attracted a high number of viewers from reality television fans. The manager said that people who missed the live show went to Google to search for the YouTube video of the eviction show. He said that the search phrases included, “Big Brother Nigeria, 2017 eviction”, “Efe and Marvis”, “#bbnaija”, “Africa Magic, and “BBA Naija 2017”. Kola-Ogunlade said that in the world of sports, football lovers searched using terms such as “Granada vs Barcelona highlights”, “Barcelona Granada”, “Granada vs Barcelona” and “Arsenal vs Man City”.

Hahaaa, e fe para yin tan ni! okonko You fool how do you know it’s Muslims or even ethicist? Unless if you are a Muslim and you are amongst the attackers. Braun Read the story again. Or do u need ur reading glasses? The victims are all Christians. Or is boko haram now operated by Christians who shout Allahu akbar? Abeg use the small brain wey God dash u. Babakadi21 Then those that killed over 100 Muslims in Katsina must be Christians since all one need to justify who kill who is by identifying the religion of the killer as shown by your ogogoro joint judgement undilluted Islam is the problem we have in the world today… So it seems PERISCOPE Islam is not the problem it is christian hegemony Sam Christian hegemony leads you to slaughter your fellow Muslims? Why not think before you write. Nadeco Since the North East is becoming a very difficult terrain for Boko Haram to operate, it seems as if they are moving to North West considering recent killings in Katsina and Kaduna states. Hope the government will see to this region now before it becomes uncontrollable. I think there is need to declare emergency in all the troubled areas and not just Yobe, Borno and Adamawa. Lanus Yeah, state of emergency in the northern states……. but is that working in those areas already under the state of emergency? Omotolaaraujo These attacks are going on without resistance. The murder is not going to stop. The least this lousy government could do is provide arms to the citizens there, so they could die fighting instead of being slaughtered outright. The North is a war zone. The FG is complicit. EASTERN_REGION If we Christians don’t realize that what’s going on in the Middle Belt is a religious jihad, then both the South and Northern Christians will be really sorry when the curtain finally drops. Folks, forget all these crap you hear about Fulani herdsmen, because this a well planned and a well orchestrated ethno- religious cleansing. The core-North or Fulani’s wants the Christian North/Middle Belt to bow to them/fall in line or be wiped off slowly. Babakadi21 Mr sentiment, how about the killings of over 100 muslim villagers in Katsina by the same Fulani? What do you call that? crusade? In kaduna case, police said a team had been deployed but that of katsina we were told that there were no security to be deployed because the security were all in katsina to tighten security for Mr president visit! What bigots like you need to know is that most Fulani nomads don’t bother about religion, there cattle is their religion, if you tamper with their cattle particularly in this time that cattle rustling is gaining prominence like kidnapping, you must be prepare to pay dearly for it. EASTERN_REGION Answer: Boko haram-Kanuri’s and Fulani’s are on a mission. Kanuri’s and Fulani’s are more closely related I believe. Reflect, think and ponder on what you just heard. And you said Fulani’s don’t care about religion? Tell us who is Dan Fodio? Who launched or started Jihad in Nigeria? Who occupied Hausaland and Yorubaland. Fulani and Kanuri invaders! Who forcefully converted some Yoruba’s? Fulani’s! pure heart shut up your dirty mouth Odini Adc U are very correct sir, de are just foolings us using d word herdsmen as a cover up. God will show dem wat meks Him God in due course. Iphy Hey folks, can i just divert your attentions for a second? I guess Nigerians should be pushing for decentralized government whereby the states are partially independent from the Federal government. This is what a true Federalism is. The version we have in Nigeria is the fake one and this is why we have many problems and more corruption. If the states were independent crimes like this wouldn’t affect the country the way it is now. And we might not even be having Boko Haram issues. The problem is the police in all the 36 states are funded and receive others from federal government. Nigeria needs state policing. It is more security effective, just look at other countries. New York police, Washington police, Calgary police etc. Why can’t we have Enugu Police, Lagos police, Kaduna kano etc. Nigeria is always known to do things the opposite in as much as it will throw in millions into the pocket of those who are in political office. And the the government made sure that the rest of the citizens are kept in perpetual ignorant with schools on strike and lame educational institutions that produce illiterates and educated but yet ignorant graduates. These leaders send their own children to study abroad yet they go their to live a lavish life without actually studying. Abdul You don’t worth to be in the midst of human with what you’ve just commented. How about if I also say your CAN is behind the killing that goes on in the north with the support of GEJ EASTERN_REGION Sorry, next time I will bite my tongue to cover the truth. But who are the Emir’s, Sarkin and the Shehu’s? Fulani’s mostly! Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, etc etc…..sorry dude, truth hits hard and hurt. OKISI REAL Religious extremism has caught up with Nigeria. While BH is spreading terror up north, christian pastors are raising 419 to an unprecedented height in the south. The victims in both situation are ordinary citizens. Do you still need any soothsayer to convince you that both Islam and Christianity are simply not needed in this country? Soul_brother I’d rather be duped than be slaughtered PERISCOPE BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD EVERYWHERE, GOD PLEASE SAVE NIGERIA FROM DISTRUCTION. greatbiodun What is happening is this country; why is blood everywhere in the north? pure heart where are the so called police men? disqus_KPlS8wWO31 At times, I wonder if these Fulanis are human beings. They are beasts, agents of Satan. elochris Why Muslims everywhere in the world they are making terrorist and why 100% percent of Muslims are terrorist in the name of religious Iphy To say that 100 percent of Muslims are terrorist is wrong and unfair to those who are peaceful Muslims. Don’t say this like this it does not encourage even the peace that you claim to stand for. Iphy I wonder when Nigerians will learn to make sane comments and write their critique without any form of prejudice. Honestly, you cannot openly prejudice against another part of your country for any reason unless you are in Africa. We don’t have respect for fellow human beings. All we do is to blame and take sides based on ethnic and religious ground. If you don’t like people you must not openly say it to their face, tolerate and accommodate each other. There should be no divisions in one country but I will always blame the system of government and the legislatures who refuse to make laws to that would enlighten and develop Nigeria. Booker The “religion of peace” strikes again. First the elementary kids, now this. Saabs Must your brother have to be ur enemy becouse you want to eat? Nigerians are really alienated people, disoriented, stupified, and blindfolded by visionless leadership.

It’s one of the most popular games on Android and iOS, with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems. Like changing their name, transferring a village or switching to a new device. We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems. Instead, most of the questions being asked in forums are about minor things. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum. Then continue on for more details and help with some potential Clash of Clans problems. With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village. With that said we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account or village. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. Among other ways. Additionally, in January of 2017 the developers announced they are ending support for any device running iOS 5 or older. This doesn’t apply to most players, but if it does, learn more details here. Update your device or transfer your village before it’s too late. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail. Perfect in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Read: Clash of Clans Update Problems Frustrate Gamers The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Read: How to Fix Clash of Clans Device Not Compatible Error  With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors. Even the Clan War level can help you find the right one. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below. 76 Responses 12/04/2015 Salinajhone Reply 15 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

In many ways, Shazam pioneered mobile phone-based tune identification, with a service called 2580, where users used the shortcode “2580” to ask Shazam to listen to a piece of music via the device’s microphone. The service would then trawl its audio signature database to identify the track and send a text back to the user. This was way before the era of the smarphone. It later developed an app for Apple’s App Store in 2008, which was available on the iPhone 2 that debuted that year. Shazam was also ported to Android later in 2008. For a company that has been pioneering music identification for over 15 years, technology and the role of the CTO is clearly significant. “I’m passionate about music and have relied on Shazam to discover great new artists and tracks for almost as long as I can remember,” says Sharp. “I couldn’t be more excited to join a company with such a well-loved and ubiquitous product. I’m looking forward to working with our world-class engineering team to extend our leadership in music recognition while continuing to deliver magical new experiences for artists, users and brands,” he says. Ongoing improvements in technology have made it easier for organisations to innovate. The services now available to business are becoming abstracted further up the technology stack, meaning they can focus on innovative ideas without having to worry too much about how to wire everything together from a technology perspective. “People do not have to worry the about the underlying technology,” he says. Read more about innovation Palo Alto Research Center – formerly Xerox Parc – is the home of the modern computer. Computer Weekly speaks to its new CEO about innovation. Innovation often features high on CIOs’ agendas because it is recognised as being an important means by which information systems and technology can contribute positively to the evolution and performance of the business. Shazam is a user of elastic cloud services. For instance, the 2017 Grammy Awards was Shazam-enabled. “When we got a surge in traffic we could just scale up,” says Sharp. Without elastic cloud computing, trying to build the IT infrastructure to support the peaks in demand from the ceremony would be akin to “trying to change the wheels while the car is still moving”. Cloud computing is also linked to the so-called application programming interface (API) economy, another area where Shazam has been developing new ideas. “You can take high-level services and create innovative products,” says Sharp. “This is how Shazam integrated with the Snapchat picture messaging service, which it made available towards the end of 2016. We also provide music recognition as a service.” Cloud computing has also lowered the barrier to entry for machine learning. “When machine learning started out, it was hard to find the right people,” he says. “They came at a high price, and only Google and Facebook could afford it. But now, we have open source frameworks, and the cloud means it can all be automated so someone can apply machine learning easier than before.” Tech culture Sharp discusses the role of the CTO in a business. “You bring someone into a senior role, allow a bit of flexibility, and provide clear responsibility to lead the engineering organisation and connect people.” From a Shazam perspective, this translates into reflecting across the team how the work of individual engineers contributes to the firm, and how it contributes to the wider world. “It is about how lines of code contribute to making the world a better place,” he says. The other big focus area for the CTO is innovation. “We are the world leader in music recognition,” says Sharp. “The company recently extended its platform with augmented reality. We have to ensure we are right at the forefront.” The company is looking at how to integrate music discovery and has developed artist follow cards to widen the appeal of the service. The company is also launching a game show on Fox TV. Beat Shazam, hosted by Jaime Foxx, will see competitors try to identify music faster than the app. “We are combining the show with the mobile device,” says Sharp. “This provides a way to enable viewer participation.” Driving innovation Sharp believes there are a number of tried and tested techniques, such as hack days that can be used to stimulate an innovation culture in organisations, but he says their success depends on people being in the right frame of mind. “You need to get people excited about the organisation,” he says. This is easier if the organisation is fortunate enough to have lots of success. “You don’t want to get in a situation where people just build and release code,” says Sharp. “It is the leader’s responsibility to keep up the excitement. You want people to talk to their friends about new ideas, and even work at on Saturdays.” While he clearly does not advocate having engineers locked up hacking code over the weekends, Sharp believes the idea of people loving the work they do comes about when they get excited enough to celebrate successes and talk enthusiastically about their job. Making breakthroughs Statistically, as many as nine out of 10 ideas will not work. “Taking something from engineering into a product doesn’t happen often, but when it does, we need to shout about it,” says Sharp. At Shazam, there are people who work on pure research and development (R&D), such as hardcore music recognition, and investigate new ways to do it faster. “A lot of engineers work on delivery projects as well as innovation,” he says. “They have an opportunity to work on things that may not pay off.” “Taking something from engineering into a product doesn’t happen often, but when it does, we need to shout about it” Richard Sharp, Shazam The pay-off may not necessarily mean a breakthrough. “I have never seen an R&D project where nothing has come out of it,” says Sharp. “R&D provides new knowledge that delivers on future roadmaps.” R&D still has its ups and downs, and as a CTO who has to manage both the expectations of his staff and the board-level executives, he says it’s important to remain open and honest about expectations, and that sometimes it pays off to take a gamble. For Sharp, being a great engineer is about more than just coding. He believes truly great engineers should be able to come up with opportunities for the company that no one else would be able to spot. “The really great engineers write code and have also got the skills to spot and deliver great ideas,” he says. “They are the people who will become the future leaders in organisations.” CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

The latest entrant to the smart-home market is Google Home, which launched today in the UK – a glacial five months after it became available in the US. With the Amazon Echo now practically a household name and Samsung’s omniscient AI creation Bixby adding yet another to string to the bow of its smart-home supremacy, can Google Home offer enough to upset the apple cart? Read more: Watch out Alexa: Google's AI voice assistant's been released into the wild Connectivity If we’re going to take connected home technology as seriously as the manufacturers want us to, then Internet of Things tech needs to stop acting as innovative, yet very much separate devices, and genuinely start to fit into the ecosystem of the home. Google Home has an instant step up on the competition here. While the Echo’s detractors felt that it was purely a feed for Amazon’s commercial activities, Home will slot seamlessly into the wider Google architecture – which means Home will happily read out your e-mails, play tunes from your Play Music account and beam content to your TV via YouTube Of course, it’s not just about fitting into a single ecosystem. The battle for hearts and minds will truly be won when a device offers seamless and simple connectivity around the home – but Google, as part of its wider framework, is already a step ahead of the competition. Search Engine Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence behind Home, is another massive draw – not least because it’s powered by Google’s souped-up search engine. Our own research at the end of last year found that Google Assistant ranks among the most appealing features of the new breed of smartphone – alongside instant favourites such as the iPhone’s dual lens camera.* It will, however, cause concerns around privacy and data use to rear its ugly head again. Google has insisted that Home will only listen for things that users have given it permission to, yet it may be facing an uphill struggle. Consumers are already perturbed by the (partially substantiated) thought of devices picking up on snippets of conversation and consequently serving up relevant ads on your phone - tech companies are yet to properly calm these fears. Pricing If you’ve been tempted by the Amazon Echo but couldn’t justify taking a punt at that pricepoint, the Google Home’s £129 price tag - £20 less than the Echo - might be the incentive you need. Connected home technology is still a brave new world for a large swathe of the population – Google Home is priced as an entry level product, but with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a voice-activated digital butler. Google Home is offering a lot in a small and fairly-priced package. Aesthetically and practically the device sits toe-to-toe with the Amazon Echo, but with a more affordable price point that should invite fence-sitters into the smart-home space. Its real difficulty will be in winning over consumers who are already on board with the Echo. High profile wins such as being fitted out in the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas shows that the Amazon device has made some serious headway in the market. If Google can be the first to comfortably tie together all the 'connected' devices around your house, then it stands a chance of comfortably leapfrogging all other pretenders to the smart-home throne.

Show More With all the stuff our smartphones can do these days, it's easy to forget that they're also still phones -- y'know, things we use when we want to speak to other humans. (A crazy notion, I realize.) And while voice-call features aren't usually the most attention-grabbing elements of a modern mobile device, Google's Phone app has some genuinely useful tools for making life easier when it comes to good old-fashioned verbal communication. If you've got a Pixel or Nexus device, take a few minutes to make sure you're taking advantage of the following possibilities. (Note that these features are part of Google's own Phone app, which appears on its Nexus and Pixel devices as well as on its partner-made Android One phones. If you have a different phone, this specific info probably doesn't apply to you. Some of these features may also not be available in all countries. Capisce? Capisce.) 1. Integrated business search That search bar at the top of the Phone app isn't just for finding your contacts. Once you activate the app's Nearby Places feature, you can also use it to look up and call businesses in your general area. [ To comment on this story, visit JR's Google+ page. ] First, tap the three-dot menu icon in the upper-right corner of the Phone app, then select "Settings" followed by "Nearby Places." On the next screen, make sure the toggle next to "Nearby Places" is activated -- and if you want your results to include places from your recent search history, too, make sure the toggle next to "Personalized search results" is activated as well. jr The next time you type a few letters in the Phone app's search bar, you should see results for local businesses along with any relevant contacts. Tap the name of the business to call it, or tap the icon to its left to pull up a card with additional info like the company's phone number, address (with the option to launch navigation), and a one-tap link to its website. 2. Caller ID and spam-call warnings The Google Phone app can instantly pull up info on any unknown calls coming into your line -- and in a particularly cool twist, it can also warn you if the number is known for spammy activity. When you get a call from a number that's been flagged, you'll see the words "Suspected Spam Caller" on the incoming call screen. The alert will also show up in your call history (under the app's second tab, with the clock icon above it). jr To make sure you're taking advantage of the spam warning system, head back into the Phone app's settings and select Caller ID & Spam, then confirm that the toggle for that feature is activated. Hasta la vista, robo-calls and telemarketers. 3. A simple and universal call-blocking tool Ready to say so-long to someone forever? With the Google Phone app and Android 7.0 or higher, you can block specific numbers with a couple quick taps -- and your list of banned digits will always stay synced with your Google account and thus will automatically be present on any other phones you use in the future. The easiest way to block a number is to find it in your call history within the Phone app. Tap or long-press on its line, then tap the "Block/report spam" option that appears. (Reporting a number as spam has no immediate effect on your phone, but it does help Google get better at identifying spam calls for everyone -- so use that power wisely, compadre.) If you want to review your list of blocked numbers or manually add a number, go back to the Phone app's settings and select "Call Blocking." jr (Bonus tip: You can also block numbers and manage your blocked list in Google's Messages app, if you use that for texting.) 4. A friendlier way to avoid someone's calls Maybe you've got a "pal" who calls a little too often but doesn't quite warrant the full-on blocking treatment. No problem: Tap the people icon within the Phone app's top bar (the third tab, between your call history and voicemail). Next, find the problematic person in the list or use the "Add new contact" icon in the lower-right corner to add them into your contacts if they aren't already there. Tap the person's name, then tap the three-dot menu icon in the upper-right corner of the info card that appears. Finally, tap the option labeled "Route to voicemail" and breathe a sigh of relief. jr The next time your buddy calls, the most you'll hear is a single after-the-fact voicemail ding. And they'll be none the wiser to your gentle partial-banning action; they'll still hear the standard four-ish rings on their end, and it'll just seem like you didn't pick up.

This one is where the local knowledge panel is not even showing the map in the box. Yes, Google is testing not showing a map for local results in the Google search results. Sergey Alakov, who catches most of these local changes, posted a few screen shots of this on Twitter but here is one: This does not surprise me because Google is constantly testing stuff with maps in search. In fact, I probably only cover 50% of the tests reported to me. So it is almost impossible to track all the different UI tests in search for local, let alone search in general. We do post many of them here but far from all of them. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ hands-on: Betting big on big David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 8:04am PDTMar 29, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Galaxy S8 News Phone Reviews Videos The Galaxy S6 was, by all accounts, a truly transformational moment for Samsung's industrial design. After years of building plastic phones constantly lambasted for their "cheapness," Samsung made radical changes in an attempt to completely redefine its smartphone brand. Those changes were generally well received, but it always felt like they stopped short: the software was still slow, bloated, and the battery life surprisingly poor. With the Note5 and S6 edge+ we saw significant refinement of that reinvention "moment," but not until the S7 and S7 edge did Samsung really build the concept I think they set out to with those first metal and glass sandwiches. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are Samsung's attempt to show us that they can do more than just iterate on that "Eureka" moment they had in 2015, even if those iterations have generally been quite good. And after the Note7 disaster last year, they really need to make good on that promise. After spending some time with the phones last week, I'm still on the fence as to whether Samsung has truly succeeded - but I think the pieces for success are there. Even if I don't think they're all terribly obvious, and even if the phones don't take any real big risks. The hardware Take what you loved about the Galaxy S7 edge and Note7, then just imagine it all being better. More refined, more coherent, more polished. As to that final point: literally. The Galaxy S8 siblings now feature polished aluminum mid-frames, as opposed to the matte anodized finish of years past. In particular - at least in my opinion - this looks good on the Midnight Black version of the phone, which features a shiny black mid-frame to match. The whole phone visually sort of looks like a deep black stone - it's a very interesting and striking effect Samsung has achieved here. As you'd expect of Samsung, the attention to detail is impeccable. The glass meets the aluminum in a very natural, near-seamless way, and the various body colors all have a distinct character. The front of the phones, however, do not: unlike years past, all colors of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will feature black surrounds on the display side of the phone, to accentuate Samsung's "infinity display" and its minimal bezel. I absolutely agree with this design decision, because it brings the canvas - the screen - out as the sole focal point of the front of the device. You're drawn to the screen, and everything surrounding it just sort of falls away. Samsung has been paying attention to the little stuff, too. Everything from the design of the camera module (it now has more of a stylized "lens" effect) to the smooth USB-C cutout seems carefully considered and manufactured with precision. The phones scream quality, and I am continually impressed by Samsung's ability to iterate in this area. Samsung clearly spends a lot of time and energy on its design and manufacturing processes, and it shows. Perhaps most notably, these phones mark the end of one of the last vestigial elements of the Galaxy brand: capacitive navigation keys and the physical home button. It really makes the S8 and S8+ the cleanest-looking handsets Samsung's ever produced. Above the display sit the standard array of sensors, including a new 8MP front-facing camera with software-simulated autofocus (we'll see how that goes) and the iris scanner array. Out back, Samsung says the 12MP rear camera is basically unchanged physically from last year's, with most optimizations happening on the photo processing side. I'm certainly curious to see how photos compare to last year's phones, then. You still get IP68 waterproofing, and 64GB of storage is now standard (with microSD expansion available). Samsung has retained the headphone jack, but made the switch to USB-C it began with the Note7 last year. Wireless charging is intact, too. As to the deceptively giant displays, at 5.8 and 6.2", respectively, the phones are considerably taller this year. But they're also narrowed, meaning they're easier to get a grip on, and they really aren't especially heavy or unwieldy. Ceding so much of what was previously bezel space to the expanded display seems an obvious choice in retrospect, but to me it definitely necessitated the end of the capacitive keys, otherwise all that extra height tends to feel a bit wasted. Speaking of those keys. The software To answer your first and greatest question: Yes, you can switch the order of the navigation keys. You can either have them in Samsung (read: wrong) order, or change them to the standard Android layout of back, home, and recent apps (left to right). Samsung also lets you customize the color of the navigation bar background, which is nice. Sure, the iconography is nowhere near stock, but I couldn't really give a damn what the buttons look like as long as they do what I expect them to. And no, Bixby is not mapped to long-pressing the home key: that's 100% Google Assistant. (Bixby's functional overlap with Assistant is actually quite minimal - for now.) The latest version of I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-TouchWiz is based on Android 7.0 (not 7.1, sigh) and feels basically similar to what we had on the Note7 and now have on the Galaxy S7 phones. "Grace UX" is the easiest on the eyes TouchWiz has ever been, and while there are still a bunch of old features in there I hardly think warrant the real estate in the settings app, Samsung continues to provide its own useful additions. I didn't spend much time with the software in-depth, as I really didn't have time. And Samsung's Bixby assistant was only demoed to us in a controlled, scripted test environment, which is useless from an evaluation perspective. I can give you the overview, though: it's basically Google Goggles meets Google Now meets voice-powered accessibility controls. It's definitely an interesting mesh of features, though Samsung's hardest push seems to be around the idea that people will want to use their voice to control things like their screen brightness, toggling the hotspot, picking a camera mode or filter, and generally controlling their device. I am, to put it bluntly, unconvinced anyone will use this. But maybe it'll win me over when our review units come in and I actually have a chance to put it to the test. But, if you were worried that Bixby was an attempt to subvert Google Assistant and replace it: please, don't be. Not yet, at least. Google Assistant and Bixby happily coexist on the Galaxy S8, and are frankly rather different products. Oh, and this is kind of interesting, I guess: Samsung has also implemented the fingerprint scanner gesture to bring down the notification bar. It's off by default, I think, but it's there. Like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge after their respective Nougat updates, the S8 and S8+ don't actually display in their native, physical resolutions by default (they're set to full HD mode). I remain very divided on this choice: while I know the vast majority of people who own these phones will never, ever notice and reap considerable battery life returns as a result, why put in these more expensive ultra-high-res panels in the first place? Samsung's answer, of course, relies heavily on VR, because you need that Quad HD display mode to provide a good VR experience. But I don't think anyone, even Samsung, has actually produced compelling evidence that consumers care about VR (apart from the companies making VR products). I guess it comes down to the question of how much more a Quad HD panel of this type would cost to produce than a 1080p version. If it's not a big difference, then I guess I get where Samsung is coming from. One feature I found quite interesting is the new home button wake gesture. Simply press your finger on the home button that is shown in the always-on display mode for a moment, and the screen will wake, indicated by a light burst of haptic feedback. While obviously you won't get far if you have a fingerprint scanner lock set, you might be more likely to use Samsung's iris scan or face unlock features (the latter is new to the S8). Given rumors that Samsung intended to place the fingerprint scanner inside the display itself with the S8 but failed to achieve the necessary yields, I have to wonder if this is the compromise they've settled on: pushing customers away from the ubiquitous fingerprint scanner, for now, until their more impressive technology is ready for primetime. As for me, I probably wouldn't use the home button wake regardless - the fingerprint scanner is simply my preferred mode of authentication. The reader is definitely a bit of a reach on these phones, though, and even with my relatively long fingers I found the S8+ would definitely take some getting used to in terms of default hand positioning. Samsung's iris scanner tech is fast and very accurate, but I'm not always looking at my phone when I unlock it. Performance on the phones is not something I feel comfortable expressing any definitive opinion on at this time. They felt fine - not crazy fast, not particularly slow - but given the notoriety Samsung's phones have achieved for slowing down over time, my experience in a controlled demo environment is simply not going to be helpful in assessing these things. It's probably better for me to end that discussion here and save the extended thoughts for our review. I obviously can't judge battery life yet, but Samsung shared an interesting figure with me: the new batteries in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature much better cycle longevity than the ones in last year's phones. Whereas after a year of typical charge and discharge cycles last year's Galaxy S7 and S7 edge would see around 20% of their effective capacity lost, Samsung says that figure is more like 5% of capacity lost over a year on the S8 and S8+. That's definitely encouraging. Final thoughts The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are big, beautiful phones. The larger displays are absolutely great, and the switch to virtual navigation keys is long overdue. I'm sure they'll have great cameras, and I expect battery life will probably be largely comparable to last year's phones (i.e., good). TouchWiz is, as far as user experience goes, the best it's ever been. That may not be saying much for some of you, but I generally find Samsung's UI modifications at the very least aesthetically palatable nowadays, and some of the added features are genuinely useful. A switch to 64GB of storage as standard is absolutely welcome and, I think, should be the bar to meet for any flagship phone in 2017. Bixby, despite the fears of many (myself included), doesn't really seem meant to displace Google Assistant or search on your phone. The Snapdragon 835 version of the S8 and S8+ we'll get here in the US packs a lot of new and potent technology, too - it's not just faster than the 820 and 821, it's more efficient and more capable. What am I not loving yet? Launching with Android 7.0 feels oh so typical Samsung: they can preach all they want about how they test their software endlessly in order to ensure updates are smooth and low on bugs, but I just can't shake the feeling that Samsung really has no intention of changing its approach to Android platform updates. Performance is going to be a big question, too (and it's one Samsung seems uninterested in discussing). I won't even be able to conclusively come to an answer in our review, simply due to the amount of time we'll have to use the phones before publishing. That'll take weeks and months of additional testing. Finally, there's a lot of uncertainty remaining around the value proposition these phones will offer, and without pricing, that's hard to comment on just yet. There's also a lingering feeling that the S8 and S8+ feel iterative in terms of actual user experience versus being showcases for advancements in industrial design and engineering. Samsung itself seems very eager to present the reduced bezel and larger displays as the raison d'etre for the Galaxy S8. But it's hard to tell if beauty is more than skin deep with these phones. Why is the screen curved? Because it's pretty (fragile, and the edge UI experience sucks). Why is the aluminum frame now polished? Because it's pretty (and will get scratched). Why aren't the batteries any bigger? Because thin phones are pretty (even though everyone wants bigger batteries). These are thoughts that I've had a harder time shaking than I expected. There's no doubt the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are exceptional achievements from the standpoint of design and phone-building knowhow, but I think I can distill my feelings about them down to this: I'm really unsure why I'd want one of these that much more than a Galaxy S7 edge or, if it still existed, a Note7. If there's some major improvement to performance I missed, maybe that could be it, but on most other fronts - aside from the switch to virtual nav keys - I'm left scratching my head a bit. But, maybe that's just a result of not having enough time with them. Hopefully, we'll be reviewing these phones soon enough, as I'm eager to get a deeper sense of the changes Samsung's made and how they translate into a real-world product experience.

As for android 7.1 it really doesn't matter as samsung usually incorporates a lot of the new features long before they are available on newer android versions. Eagerly looking forward to the Note 8 though (4K screen for VR is going to be a much needed upgrade). Taylor Vaughn I freelance online, performing basic jobs which simply requires from you a laptop or computer as well as internet accessibility and it is a life-saver for me personally... After 6 months on this job opportunity and i gained so far total of 36,000 dollars... Basicly i make about eighty bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hour most of the days.And marvelous thing about this job is that you can easily manage time while you work and for how long as you like and you get paid weekly >> http://v15.uk/xbRHM MJ I agree 4K is much needed for VR but I would question 4K or VR on a phone. LOL Toss3 Why? Works much better on phones as they aren't tethered to anything. Personally only use it for watching movies on planes or in bed when the gf is sleeping. MJ That is your only use cases? It's more useless than I thought. I watch movies on my big screen TV on my sweet couch when the GF is sleeping. No heavy BDSM head gear needed. Toss3 Pretty much. Never liked watching movies on a TV as TVs are always really small (unless you buy one of those 40k ones that are 100"<). I had a projector (with a 120" screen), but I sold it when I moved to another country, and because I don't watch TV that often a "big-screen" TV just doesn't feel that useful. I also like being thoroughly engrossed in the movies I watch without any distractions and only the Gear VR has offered me anything like that thus far. It's also the first private movie-theater that you can take with you wherever you go. The low resolution is the only thing that could be improved (and the straps of course). MJ Sure if it works for you but I don't like things strapped to my head and face. It must be a pain to unstrap when need a drink, snack, or take a piss. Toss3 You either lift the device (similar to ski goggles or snorkel) or you use the built-in pass-through mode. And there's really no need to unstrap anything when going for a piss. MJ I didn't mean literally unstrap but none of that sounds convenient or practical at all. LOL It must be me... MJ Samsung has made a product I would almost consider buying by cleaning up the UX, going with on-screen buttons, better aspect ratio, and minimizing the edge gimmick (next just get rid of it) while keeping the headphone jack and wireless charging BUT... The placement of the fingerprint is just horrible. David, you went on how Samsung pays attention to the details but they just randomly place the fingerprint reader? OK... They still make me wary of getting timely OS updates. Android 7.0? Really? I like to see if they follow up on their promise of monthly security updates on their unlocked phones. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU My S7 Edge, unlocked, Romania, received Nougat but still on freaking January security update! How bout dat? MJ That sucks but didn't they just make that promise a couple of weeks ago? Cristian-Teodor TATOIU They made that promise months ago but with the new top dog in tow... They'll make good on S8, no doubt, for the first 6-7 months. Then, they'll have the S9 to keep them busy. And so on, and so on... Really, really, really want/need timely security updates? Pixel or whatever Google brings out is the way to go. Not freaking out cause of some security vulnerabilities going unpatched for months? Samsung is an option then... They'll update, sooner or... Jordan L my friend, who is kind of paranoid about security, loves the Galaxy series of phones(probably because they look great). From a data security prospective; do you think Pixel or Galaxy is "more secure". He's worried less about hacks on old versions of the OS, he's worried about his cloud data. I vote for Pixel because you are only logging in with your Google account, and not also logging into your phone with a "Samsung" account. to use features. yes, Google tracks everything you do, but they are a US based company. Samsung is not, ... just a thought. I would THINK he would HATE the fact that he logs into his phone with Samsung account too. (you do have to use a Samsung account to fully use a Galaxy phone, right?) Justin You don't have to log in to Samsung's account to use the phone, but you lose out on things like Samsung Pay if you don't. EcE You don't need a Samsung account unless you want Samsung Pay, themes ( and their crapstore) or VR. Even then, they are two different accounts and AFAIK you don't need to share any private information to the Samsung account unless you use Samsung Pay. Vivek Rameses A non us company is much safer and private. Muh americans love garbage made in the US. dabug91 The Pixel would be the superior choice, as they will get monthly security updates through October 2019 at least. Max Johnson Battery size is concerning, but maybe that's something to do with precaution with the fire issue. Lawrence Fail!: It is way too tall, fingerprint sensor on the back, small battery, new bixie assistant with dedicated button, same old camera. Win. 64gb storage, looks cool. Biga173rd So what's a win in your book that can compare to this new phone? Zsolt V The same phone with a fruity fruit logo Biga173rd Ehhhh lno lol Lawrence Thanks for asking : the S7 and S7 edge... Better battery/size ratio same camera, same ram. Front fingerprint, and they can be hold by humans. Biga173rd Good point I personally will wait for the Note 8. Toss3 Agreed on the fingerprint sensor, but it does have face-unlock which should be a useful alternative (it is on Win 10 devices). I seriously don't understand why these companies are forcing AI assistans on us? Do people really use them? AI is useful, but not for phones. Camera is already good enough; use pro mode and it's amazing. Really can't expect better in a phone right now unless you start increasing the sensor size. EcE " this looks good on the Midnight Black version of the phone, which features a shiny black mid-frame to match" Glad to see the black phone is black on the sides, that chrome version looks horrible. Marcel Mayer hä? the device will show on 5pm? why you publish the article? PhillipeFelut so, whats the actual resolution of the display itself? DeathWolfGaming They are set to 1080p to save battery life. PhillipeFelut 2960x1440 is the number i was looking for. Jesse Lee Samsung is really receptive to their markets; a completely opposite direction from years past and from that being employed by Google Inc. The results are phones that continue to get better and better and more practical. Looks great! Timbets Linux 4.4 kernel Ishimaru I'm surprised. Even Google is still on 3.x. ProductFRED I'm not jumping to sell my S7 Edge Exynos just yet. Gotmilo waiting for the note 8 JD It's a damn solid phone. I wouldn't jump unless I pooped money and was having a bad case of the runs. Winston I'm upgrading from my flat S7 to the small S8. Why? Battery has deteriorated, and Samsung usually does really lucrative trade in deals with older phones, of which I still have an S4. John New smartphone releases are beginning to be as exciting as new dishwasher releases. That's a good thing as it means we can hold on to our phones for longer, smaller manufacturers can catch up to the big boys, and there will be more price competition rather than feature competition. Samsung seems to realize this which is why they're making a big push to differentiate on software. We would benefit from more alternatives to Google's software. I'm just skeptical that Samsung is capable. BC Um, why no images of the Dialer App's interface? It's something that I always want to know but never can readily find. David Ruddock Because I had an hour with the phones total and that wasn't really on my priority list. Sorry. BC It's cool, I'm just a weirdo that likes to know what all the interfaces I'll be interacting with regularly look within OEM apps. Cakefish Just look up the S7 Nougat update UI. I am pretty sure it'll be very similar to that, the rest of the S8's UI is. BC Not good enough for me, though I'll likely preorder the device...I'll be able to see it firsthand this way. Cakefish Check out the bajillion youtube hands-on videos, I'm sure one of them has what you're looking for :) BC I can only hope, though I have a feeling nobody will even care about the Dialer App. Cakefish Found one for ya! Look at 2:12 in the video: https://youtu.be/sZvp4L52QzQ BC Thank you! I had begun the scanning of videos to catch a hint of that app interface. Phone_Addiction Time to ditch my ip7 plus for the gs8+ brararsh Thinking of same. Adil Tajgeer i'm in the same boat but with the regular S8, it seems to be a great blend of big screen in a small package. but will just keep my iphone around. I NEED ALL THE SHINY THINGS. Biga173rd Wow!! that is one gorgeous phone. The build quality is incredible damn Sammy knocked it out of the park. And that metal frame... Nuno G. "You can either have them in Samsung (read: wrong)" Although it's not the standard order for Android, for me it's the natural order, specially for right handed persons!!! When I hold the phone, I hold normally with my right hand, so my thumb finger is the finger that is most near the screen on the right side of it. so it's normal for me to have the back button cause that's the one that I use more.. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Right handed persons" all have different preferences, I am right handed and I use the back button on the left. Middlefinger Im a lefty and Samsungs is still the better positioning. Google just have it wrong but the fanbois on here would never disagree with their Google god. JD Gotta say it wasn't until the S7e that I started to look at Samsung and that Samsung actually got me excited about Android Hardware again. I used to be a Nexus Diehard and when Google and other OEMs just all made glass rectangles, some with really bad software decisions I just gave up. But the S7e was something interesting. The S8 is a really lovely piece of Industrial engineering, like what the OG iPhone and iPhone 4 did to the industry when everyone was doing more of the same. jonzey231 I love that they continue to include wireless charging. iKon It's not even wireless... False advertising more like. jonzey231 Kay. Sharky I've been on Nexus for 5 years but I'm going to give this a go. The bezel-less screen makes it look like something genuinely new, I really wish the Pixel had looked this. I'm still skeptical about Samsung's UI skin but the move to virtual (& customizable!) buttons alleviates that a bit. Hopefully this will encourage Google to step up their efforts with the next Pixel, but it's going to take a big jump from last year's model to get me back. Jay The skin has not been a concern since s7. The whole look can be altered with one click via the theme store. I use one that makes it either look like native android or a jet black theme, that's so enjoyable on these amoled screens. Daniel Tiberius I'm looking forward to playing around with those themes. Middlefinger *S6. Sharky Admittedly the skin does looks quite nice now, I certainly hope I'm converted now I've shelled out $850 on this thing. Kevin Chaos I'm using the S7 and I really want the S8... but I'm going to force myself to wait and at least see what Apple has to offer with their next iPhone. That or Google needs to fix the Android messaging clusterfuck they've created. I've been using Android phones since the Nexus One but iPhones have come a long way and iMessage is starting to look really good. Toss3 Not sure why anyone with an S7/S7E would feel the urge to upgrade. Why not use something like Telegram, Whatsapp, etc. instead of SMS? Kevin Chaos I have a problem with wanting new toys constantly, haha. I think I've gotten a new phone every 6 months. Almost everyone I know uses SMS here. I am also using Google Voice myself. I just don't have enough friends who use those apps. At least that's my case in the United States. Toss3 I used to be like that, but now that Android has matured and caught up with the iPhone in terms of smoothness, I really don't feel the urge to upgrade as often as I used to. Only thing I want right now is an HDR 4K screen for the Note 8 and I'll be happy. Adil Tajgeer iMessage has kept my pixel and OP3 in a drawer for most of their time with me. but the S8 is so pretty i will probably bite the bullet and face the shame of the green bubble. fijisiv Why is the screen curved? Because it's pretty... Why is the aluminum frame now polished? Because it's pretty... Why aren't the batteries any bigger? Because thin phones are pretty... While most AP readers probably do a LOT of research before buying a phone, I'd wager a huge majority of phone purchases are done by people who walk into the store and say "oh that one looks pretty." Toss3 Thankfully we still have the Note-series that should cater to a different audience (hopefully). Adnoxaei It's beautiful, but I'll be skipping it it :/ The fingerprint scanned is just in a terrible spot for my normal usage. I hope one of those scanner techs that can go through the screen can get implimented in the next couple generations. Winston It was reportedly very close to being in the S8, but they couldn't quite get something good enough for it to be signed off. So, Note 8? Adnoxaei The note line got the iris scanner, so it is possible. I already think the S8 is a bit big (really, just too tall), so maybe it can be in the S9 and I'll get it then. At least my bank account will be happuer this year haha. Rann Xeroxx Once you use a scanner on the back of the phone, it actually turns out to be better as that is where your fingers typically are when holding the device. The only problem I can see is if you have it on a table or something and want to use the scanner. (I never do this as I rarely will leave my phone on a table). Miguel Fernandes How can it be better with that limitation? Jan Ibrahim Because in most circumstances for a lot of people , you unlock as you remove from your pocket. This is a lot easier with it on the back. Furthermore, it also means you can achieve a nice clean look on the front of the phone. But no solution is perfect, because the downside is desk use. But i find on the odd occasion I'm using my phone on my desk then pattern lock is fine. But I'd rather have on the back with that limitation than the other way around. Look how ugly the fingerprint scanners look on the front of some of the HTC and oneplus phones for example. John My problem with the S8 is not that the scanner is on the back, which is fine, but that it's all the way up next to the camera. Below the camera would have made more sense. iKon It's only good on the back, if it's in the middle like Huawei devices. Samsung has the worst position out of everyone. My name is…. Google needs to take lessons on how to make pretty phones. Who's gonna prefer a pixel to this? Crazy fanboys only. saf1927 People who actually want a phone. No flat display, no good. My name is…. Pixel was a joke of a phone, i cant believe that Google gave that thing iphone price, so ridiculous. Im sure S8 will be better in every aspect. asian_slaw if you are solely hating on the phone because of the price, you definitely dont understand or have experienced the pixel to it's full potential My name is…. I had a pixel on my hands. i also was an owner of all Nexus phones (after Nexus 4) I would never buy a pixel. There are better phones out there that are better. saf1927 Yes, after coming out half a year later, it doesn't take that much to get a better phone out. By the way, the iPhone 7 will still outperform the S8. it’s me tim-cock. Dude calm your tits. This phone puts the garbage looking iphone and pixel to shame. Your move crapple. saf1927 Come again when Samsung actually puts out a phone that is better than an iPhone in all aspects. A high-res display is nothing to flash your ass out for. Lars Jeppesen Yeah, much better display, more ram, better waterproofness, more freedom (default app anyone? ), wireless charging, fast charging, iris scanner, much higher screen-to-phone ratio, SD card support, bluetooth 5, wifi direct, VR, better assistant (Google Assistant/Bixby),, OH YEAH_, the iPhone sure is better... /s saf1927 >much better display Doesn't make a difference since the iPhone has one of the best and most accurate displays in the market. > more ram Well, with the bloat you get from it, I think it's a plus that it has the RAM to cope with it. >better waterproofness Not a deal-breaker >more freedom Nothing to do with Samsung, it's general Android feature. > fast charging / wireless charging I'll give you the first, the second is a gimmick and not really "wireless". >iris scanner A gimmick you can live without > SD card support Not needed since you can't install apps on it. > bluetooth 5 Nice, but the phone is coming out in 2017, least they could do. > better assistant Google Assistant, yes. Bixby is yet to prove itself. Now, when Samsung and Qualcomm can match the A10 performance, let's talk. Rann Xeroxx Why on Earth would you pay the absurd price for the Pixel compared to a phone like this? Heck, the Pixel is ugly to boot. And purely from an enterprise standpoint, it has real problems with MDM and ActiveSync configurations to where Samsung goes out of their way to make sure it works perfectly on corporate solutions. saf1927 I actually have an iPhone 7 too, which of course is better than anything Samsung puts out. Looks are subjective. I hate edge displays, so this phone is as ugly as it gets. someone755 Agreed, keep it flat so I can put a normal screen protector on it. JohnyNoLegs Can't even do that on the pixel. These days are over someone755 Then I simply won't buy a phone like that, and I advise anyone that sympathizes with my hate of curved screens to do the same. Vote with your wallet. New_Guy Somebody just dropped some world-class knowledge. Kudos Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "the Pixel is ugly" - ever heard looks are subjective? I really like the design of the Google Pixel. More than the edge display on the Galaxy phones. h4rr4r Good you can fix the keys! Can you change the settings menu to be normal? Winston Nope, from my time with the S7. And I imagine that will soon be the new normal. Android O DP already has a similar design. So it will soon become normal. h4rr4r Please google, stop moving shit around for the sake of moving shit around. Winston You are the one moving shit around. I don't know what the hell the incentive is for lying, but I have a Galaxy S7. I have a Fast Charger. I have tried both turning the fast charger off in software, AND using a different cable. They both kept my phone cool while charging when using it, and with fast charging on it would heat up. h4rr4r I did not decide to move the buttons around at random or change the settings to some touchwiz crap. I have no idea what you are talking about with the charger. I said nothing about fast chargers. Of course fast chargers make the phone hotter. How do you think this all works? Winston It's not "considerable battery gains". They're actually fairly small: within 10-15 mins SOT in my experience. Samsung itself said, moving from the 5.7 1080p of the Note 3 to the 1440p of the 4, that the power usage delta was 3.5%. That's in hardware. Imagine how little the change is in software. lsh99 The build and design of this phone is exactly what I've been waiting for: premium finishes with a huge screen-to-body ratio. That said, I'm waiting for the Note 8. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Pricing, for Europe - 799EUR for S8, 899EUR for S8+. These should translate 1:1 to USD + taxes, for US. Of course, unlocked. Turb0wned The question is, if I ordered the US unlocked version from Best Buy, will Samsung screw me out of updates like they did with the unlocked S7E? Trysta After a major Samsung phone reveal, I usually spend the first couple days trying to rationalize how I could buy it even though touchwiz scares me, because the hardware is just so lust-worthy. But this time...not so much. It looks very fancy obviously, and I love the increased screen to body ratio (hopefully all other OEMs....*cough* Google *cough* are paying attention!). But I thought the Note 7, with the extra subtle curves was really the maximum amount of screen curve I was willing to deal with. The curve of the S8/S8+ seems to be going back towards obnoxious taking over 20% of the screen with glare again. Wish they had kept the curved edges the way they were on the Note 7. Batteries are too small, although I understand why they wanted to be careful this year. After my Nexus 6p disappointment, battery life is basically my number one feature for my next phone. And the fingerprint sensor placement is just awful, for seemingly no other reason than to be different from everyone else who has a back fingerprint sensor. I don't want to use iris scanning or face detection. Fingerprint sensors work really well for turning on my phone quickly. This is a major feature of all current flagships. Why did they think this was something that was ok to experiment with/mess up? But in the end, just like every year, I was never going to buy this phone anyway. I hope that it is a great phone for Samsung fans (I'm sure it will be). Shame-sung C.E.O Absolutely horrible looking phone.that it lacks innovation and nothing but gimmicky features. Dominic D ok it’s me tim-cock. As if anyone expect anything diffraction from you. Shame-sung C.E.O Why would anyone expect anything positive from a CORRUPT, thief company? Middlefinger Doesnt do thieving Apple or LG much harm though, or HTC with their new iPhone rip-offs. Shame-sung C.E.O You are mistaken the Corrupt Swinesung Machine that has been sued by. Apple,Dyson,BlackBerry,Microsoft,LG,TSMC And countless other manufactures for stealing. Hmm you sound like those Swinesung guys that were getting paid to Shill and got caught. You can only wish that Apple and LG and anyone else was as horrible as corrupt company as Swinesung. But unlike you i stand by Facts, go ahead and get upset. Not going to change history. : ) Middlefinger Selectively sued in countries with crap IP laws where you can patent anything vague and sue for it even if you never actually made the thing yourself. They failed to sue in countries with reasonable laws. Samsung also counter sued and won, so whatever... Shame-sung C.E.O That's a beautiful excuse. But not a good one. Funny how Swinesung has lost multiple times and agrees to settle after it has uses stolen designs and software and technology. Swingeing has lost all across the world from its home country to the the US. This is the problem with the fanboy mentality. They make poor excuses but everything is online. Swinesung has convicted 2 times of corruption in south korea alone. From Racketeering, Tax Evasion. Fraud and Embezzlement and countless other charges. Also they have the highest return in TV's in the industry with defects. Heck in the S7 and S6,5,4 have all suffered from low quality screens and having image retention issues (again all the information is online if you search) to burn in issues and lets not forget the exploding issues because they choose quantity over quality. Shamesung will always be just that. A low quality company who cares about numbers then quality. Middlefinger You're just a troll, yuor username proves that all by itself. Most of the thing Samsung have been sued for related directly to Android itself, so is Googles fault if anything, not anything they have done. You know this but just troll this site because you are a child with nothing better to do. Dont bother replying, your blocked as of now. Shame-sung C.E.O AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Facts hurt and hurt so dam much . Man how pathetic. Jay Not sure how your kind of comments continue to survive on this site. Shame-sung C.E.O Because people are entitled to facts and opinions. Just because Swinesung is a horrible corrupt company does not mean bling ignorance does not exist. I mean i like Android and think its amazing and useful, And i feel the same way about Apple , Microsoft LG ect. But Swinesung... Naw i draw the line on the most corrupt company in the tech industry by Parsec's. Dominic D I just wish Samsung would update all their devices at the same time like Apple. Okay, maybe not all... but definitely their S series of devices. It's holding me back from purchasing a Samsung phone again. My AT&T S6 Edge was beautiful but didn't receive Marshmallow for a year. It was nearly unusable on Lollipop with barely an hour and a half of screen-on time. I love my 6P and I'm soon looking to upgrade, but I'm nervous about purchasing another Samsung device. Berkay Wait for the pixel 2 Ilya Kushnir Linux Kernel 4.4.16. This happened! Maha Rashtrian TAKE MY MONEY NOW! How much does it cost though? Mix If Samsung made a phone with stock Android, that had Google's updates I would be in love. My Pixel is nice but Samsung phones just feel nicer. JSo Remember Google Play Edition devices? Those were the days. Mix I do not! My first was Android was a Nexus 4 and I came from a BB Bold! Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Galaxy S6, Pixel Xl, Pixel Xl, Pixel Xl....(I am on my third Pixel, lol) JSo Well other OEMs used to make versions of there devices with stock android on it and they were sold in the Play Store. The Galaxy S4 was one of them. Jaime May I ask why? Were your phones faulty? Mix Mic died on the 1st Pixel and the 2nd one bricked and both were RMA'd through the play store for brand new devices. someone755 "The Pixel is totally worth it, it's a great investment." You alone are proof of the contrary. Mix Just pop on over to GooglePixel on Reddit. Some people are on their 5th phone...when it works it works but my experience? This is the worst Android phone I have ever owned! My 3rd one has been great though so fingers crossed I am done RMA'ing it. someone755 Exactly. There are so many apologists out there of this phone that keep saying that the phone is worth its price, that other phones are just as flawed etc. Meanwhile there are hundreds if not thousands of customers like you. VAVAMk_2 Why? Mix Mic died on the 1st Pixel and the 2nd one bricked and both were RMA'd through the play store for brand new devices. Support has been great but my phone experience has been terrible. francoism My sister came from a BB Bold too. The initial part of pushing the contact onto Google was the only headache. Then on, it was smooth sailing. That was during the Galaxy S3 times. And for myself, months before her. Perplexed and intrigued by Android as a whole on my One X after making the move from the iPhone 3GS. I miss those times. 2kool4skool Agreed, google gets their software right but their hardware could use a lot of improvement. JohnyNoLegs Yea like messenger, allo, duo, hangouts. And pixel now has apps you can't uninstall. Google will be the next Samsung! 2kool4skool Well, should I say partly right, then? JohnyNoLegs Let's just say Samsung does it better than google recently, and that's saying something. Btw I'm on pixel xl coming from note 7. iKon Any phone looks better than the Pixels because #Bezels Bojan Radovanović well, that is true, but it's not a picture to stand in front of it and admire how it looks... Ra1nb0wD4sh DE On my pictures the bezels (aka frames) are mostly wanted though... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Samsung made the phone with stock Android, nobody except a bunch of geeks would buy it. Consumers want the features Samsung adds to Android. Mix Would the average user and purchaser of Samsung phones even know they had stock Android device? Probably not. Samsung makes mach better hardware but their updates and support after the sale freaking suck. Took something like 8 months for my SG6 phone to get an update since Google gives it to Samsung to add shit, then Telus gets to add shit, then I get it. That type of update system is pure trash. theProffer It's the same group of people that can't tell the difference between the new iPhones. You know, the ones Jimmy Kimmel makes fun of once a year. Middlefinger Samsung have to fix Googles mess first, because lets face it, Stock android is a buggy unreliable mess. You cant blame the OEMs for wanting to wait until the software is viable before they risk putting it on their customers devices. Google doesn't care, that's why the Nexus didnt sell well, and the pixel has needed fix after fix after fix. whispy_snippet No. Middlefinger Yes, but Google shills dont like to hear it. whispy_snippet Still no! Middlefinger Denial is pretty powerful. Jay Nothing in the pixel has been so broken, that's its stopped from being a consistent daily driver with over 6.5 hours SOT and over a day of standby. Issues have been present yes, but so have been with any phone. My iPhone 7+ ended up getting replaced twice... once because the damn camera unit entirely died 2 days later and secondly when the screen stopped responding. Then iOS 10.2 decided to suffer from Wi-Fi issues and all sorts of weird documented bugs. Nothing is ever 'PERFECT' However since that does not fit your narrative, it's not a thing. Middlefinger Most pixe issues are software/driver related, and thats always been the way with Google devices, although the Nexus range also had terrible build quality as well. At least the Pixel is better on that front. The problem is stock android, which is why the OEMs need to modify it to be production worthy. Im sure you will make excuses, but thats the reality. LineOS for exynos! What Better quality? The besel king! This and the iPhone Middlefinger Like it or not the Pixel is a step up over the likes of the N5, which was terrible. There was a reason the older Nexus devices were cheap, and it had nothing to do with Google 'subsidising' them. LineOS for exynos! Compared to Nexus the pixel are good but is nothing compar to Galaxy or even Huawei. The Nexus is meant to race with the iPhone.. in the meantime they​ only race to the biggest bezels Middlefinger I agree, but what i mean is purely construction quality. The Nexus was cheaply made, and it showed, especially the 4 and 5 and the tablets. The Samsungs pre-S6 were a bit cheap feeling, but at least they were made with good components and were reliable, the Nexus' were neither. whispy_snippet Well, no. Every average Joe consumer would buy it PLUS a heap of stock Android nerds. Average consumers don't have a freakin clue what TouchWiz or stock Android even are. Who gives a shit anyway. It's never going to happen. trapchan Nah, stock Android can't even block sms spam by phrase, and it took them how many years just to implement call blocking? I had it since iPhone 5. Middlefinger Oh god no. Bargain basement software that isnt reliable isnt what people want. Im sure even a stock S8 would have less issues than the trouble prone Nexus and Pixel phones, but even so, it would be commercial suicide for Samsung to rely on an unfiltered Google experience. someone755 It would net them a few thousand customers though. I know I'd be switching to a Samsung if they only made some AOSP-style software possible. Middlefinger Apple could probably sell more iPhones if they had an Android version, but it still doesnt mean it will happen. It would cheapen the Samsung brand to launch an AOSP version, and the only people that would care could just run a custom ROM anyway. someone755 Agreed on all but that last part -- That's why I'm not already a Samsung customer, as they make great efforts to prevent people from running custom ROMs. Middlefinger and yet suck ROM exist, so.. xyz It was called a Galaxy Nexus. JohnyNoLegs I prefer Samsung software. My pixel xl is barron, has nothing in comparison. Can't wait to sell and get the s8 gacl The Pure Google experience of Nexus + Pixel is nice, but Samsung hardware is nicer. A Google Play Edition Samsung would be better, but it's not that big a deal. TouchWiz is nice too. Cakefish The fact that I'm currently unemplyed will prevent me from giving in to my uncontrollable urges to always have the latest tech. S8 looks great. Switchable nav keys, 10nm processors, batteries that lose significantly less of their capacity over time. narrower dimensions for one-handed use, 64GB storage, and a Samsung equivalent to Google's HDR+ camera processing are my personal highlights. Cakefish P.S. for UK users you can get it on the 19th April if you preorder (8 days early). Also, UK pricing: S8 = £689.00, S8+ = £779.00 Middlefinger Yeah but will be cheap enough on contract which is how most people buy phones. Cakefish But I prefer to buy unlocked :( Lars Jeppesen Blame Brexit for that.. the phones are the same prices as the S7 for me here in Denmark Cakefish I do blame Brexit :( ddevito Nice phone, but no thanks. Perfectly comfy with my OP3. Then again I've never owned a Samsuck and never will james fuston jeeeesus the price point. S8 is anywhere from 720-750 and the S8+ is 850? We are getting dangerously close to breaking the 1K mark with standard configurations for phones. I can't justify paying twice the street price of an S7/S7E for one of these. This will be a hard pass for me. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The LG G6 is $750 and the Pixel XL is $869, and those two phones look pitiful compared to the S8 and S8 Plus. What are you complaining about? Cakefish 21% (S8 vs S7) and 22% (S8+ vs S7 edge) price rises for UK (thanks Brexit) hkklife Pixel XL is the biggest rip-off on the market that's not made by Apple. Google was redefining the $/performance ratio back in 2012 and 2013 with the Nexus 4/5 and Nexus 7s. And then they got greedy and cozied back up to the carriers and went sky-high with their pricing. I'd love to see the BoM for HTC and Google on the Pixels. Gotta give Samsung credit for not jettisoning important features while truly redefining what a rectangular slab handset should be. I still think that the S8 line is one step from greatness---an unlocked model updated in a timely fashion with a 6/128GB RAM/storage variant for all markets and a 500mAh battery boost would make it a world-beater. David Williams I agree. The price point should not be surprising to anyone. james fuston The Pixel XL is $779. Not sure where you're pulling that extra $100 from. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The 128 GB model is $869. There is no 64GB model. Regardless, the price differences aren't very big either way, and the Pixel XL doesn't hold a candle to the S8 Plus in terms of form OR function. james fuston Yeah, you're either entirely missing or intentionally glossing over the "standard configuration" part. Either way, I can tell you're all aboard the hype train for new technology by the amount of hyperbole you're spouting. Not sure why you felt like chiming in on my comment about the cost/value of the S8 vs the S7, but I think we're done here. Diego Kaku Why no one talks about the stupid position of the fingerprint scanner? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I hate the location of the fingerprint scanner on the S8/Plus. Absolutely despise it. But the rest of the phone is f'in amazing. And it's possible I'd end up using iris or facial recognition anyway. I'm not buying one, but that's only because I'm waiting for the Note 8. Fresh360 Well that was depressing, has all of those leaks left us jaded? What if there were no leaks and only whispers and then we saw a nearly bezel-less phone with a massive screen in a small body? I really think this preview would have had a very different tone. Suresh Aryal Nothing about speakers yet. GSMArena says it has stereo speakers. invinciblegod OH GOD MY OCD!! Those ports are not centered!!!!!!! Groud Frank Samsung Mobile is maturing as a tech company. It's no longer "Let's just copy Apple and cram features into our phones to compete with the iPhone." From Samsung Pass to Samsung Pay to Bixby to DeX, this is a beautiful phone with useful features. I can actually see this phone making my life easier, especially in the password management department. Less navigating, less touching, a focus on user experience and practicality - well done Samsung. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I think Samsung is going to break sales records with these phones. Max Gromada Well, they just "copied" those features: - google's HDR+, - the next iphone's screen proportions; - apple pay, - modern ai voice assistant (they've bought the company that had made the Siri), - apple's augmented reality tech - Nokia's / MS iris scanner. They're welcome to implement a feature-rich phone, but those innovations did not come from Samsung. Tech Writer -Combining multiple photos into one has been a thing much before google did it. Does anyone remember OPPO's 50MP super hi-def mode? Plus I'm sure the implementation is different than Pixel's HDR+. For example, this one works without HDR, and with HDR too. -Next iPhone's screen proportions? Dude, are you kidding me. Samsung is the one who is going to provide those screens to Apple. Plus, this phone is probably in development much before the iPhone. -Apple pay: No. Samsung pay uses MST, not NFC. It's a unique patented tech by looppay, which Samsung acquired. Apple can't even use it and hence Apple pay can't operate in legacy terminals. -modern ai voice assistant: Bixby is not a voice assistant. The phone has google assistant for that. Bixby is more of helper and tells you what is around you. It isn't meant to tell you a joke or search things, you have assistant for that. -apple's augmented reality tech: I really don't know what you are talking about. -Iris scanner: I'll give you that. Most of these are Samsung's own innovations, or acquisitions which are patented. Max Gromada Tech Writer, man, combining multiple photos into one has been a thing since the invention of photography ) It's just Google that made it ideal for the phones - combining multiple pics of several milliseconds of exposure into one is a brilliant idea, it greatly expands the dynamic range of small sensors, and i think every manufacturer should just copy that tecnique. Doesn't matter if they call it "hdr" or not. It improves dr, that's all we need. No, i'm not kidding - some time ago, Apple approached Koreans with the question if they could supply the screens of some specs - and voila - while Apple is still playing with the idea, figuring out if the screen should be curved or not, and how the f.. are they going to install the fingerprint scanner right into the screen... the Koreans just rolled out the phones of very similar screen proportions. I don't think this is just a coincidence. Call it a controversial bull..it ) The idea behind Apple pay was simply to pay by phone conveniently. Dunno, maybe Samsung's tech is better, but they were following Apple. I think augmented reality features are the next big thing for smartphones. Project Tango did not start well, but apple is working on it, samsung is working on it - NOT a coincidence. I don't argue with the point that Samsung is a great tech company. The point of my comment was that Samsung is still some way into "Let's copy Apple and cram features into our phones to compete with the iPhone." They definitely are set into direct competition with iphone, and at this moment, from my point of view, there are no features that apple would like to copy from samsung to compete with it. Blomsternisse I think (and hope) that most of his claims were just just jokes. Groud Frank "The next iPhone". They copied features from a phone that doesn't even exist? Are you serious? Dude, stop making a fool of yourself😂 Middlefinger Quite a bit of salt in this article. Samsungs nav buttons are not in the 'wrong' order, Googles are. Argue all you like but the fact remains its subjective and not objective. Im glad Samsung doesnt use Googles staid UX. and you cant complain about Samsung not being as innovative in the software as they are in the hardware and simultaneously get snarky about them not using Googles way of doing things. Google hasnt innovated a damn thing since ICS so if they did make a stock S8 it would be worse, based on your own claim. dabug91 Actually, you're wrong. When you use just about any web browser on the planet, where is the back button located? Top Left. Same for when you use just about any file explorer: Top Left. Same for when you use iOS devices, where do they generally place the back button? Top Left. It makes perfect sense for the back button to be on the left side of the device, because that IS the ergonomically and aesthetically superior place for it. You're wrong, get over yourself. Middlefinger Use with a mouse is different than touch use, and 2 handed touch use is different than one. You are comparing completely different UI element, so your point is invalid. dabug91 Actually, people's thumbs can very easily reach the bottom left hand side of their device, so your distraction about UI's is invalid and you're still wrong. Kys. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I hold my phone in my left hand, and use it with my right hand. The position of the back button makes no difference to me, but I like it on the right. It's not an objective thing. Give up trying to make it so. Middlefinger Right is still better for the most often used function. Given the option most people I know have that set up. Google cant be trusted to know whats best in a UI. This is the company that gave us material design, an admittedly pretty interface that gives you hardly any information per page. Its cumbersome, and this is proven by the fact that they cant even keep it consistent in their own apps, because it just doesnt work properly. Max Gromada Regarding 2-handed touch use, find the "Esc" key on your keyboard ) But, imho, when you're doing it all with your thumb, it does not matter what side the "back" key is placed. I was comfortable with the both layouts. trapchan Do you even realize that Backspace key is always placed on the right side of the keyboard, and not on the left side? You point is invalid, get over it. dabug91 The escape key, which also has a function of backing out of something is always placed on the left-hand side. The back button in Android is akin to an escape key, not a backspace key, dumbass. Your point is invalid. Get over it. trapchan try it on web browser smartass AbbyZFresh I'm sure that this new phone will be a hot commodity likurges I was about to make a joke about the bezzels but there are none.. unlike on the pixel where I have parked my airplane, built a house and a f1 track with some space left. SAM While improvements are welcomed, battery and camera didn't get much attention this year. Lets hope after everything other is taken care of this year, battery and camera will be next. I have a feeling that with what google achieved in pixel's camera, next iPhone(maybe) and pixel 2 will blow the shit out of competition. Max Gromada Actually, the camera is improverd in S8: there is a multi-exposure mode, aka pixel's HDR+, a very welcome feature. SAM I really wish this is the case. They didn't talk much about camera in live stream. Ace Time to buy gs7 _jsw_ Is that the new Gear 360 I see in the background? It's in the image of the S8+ on the stand. Max Gromada Yes, they've introduced the new Gear 360 someone755 That's all great and all, but these prices are getting ridiculous. r0xp0x Too bad even the regular sized one is a tad bit too big for me, and I don't like having a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, but it sure is gorgeous. whispy_snippet The headline feature is a big, bezzeless display. Meh. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, never mind the 835, the two types of wireless charging, the Samsung Pay, the HDR screen, the... oh, never mind. You wouldn't care, anyway. whispy_snippet No. I don't. They're just iterations on stuff Samsung always offers. They bring very little to the table that wasn't already there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Then buy a Pixel. You'll love its football field sized bezels, and the wonderful halos in its pictures. Yeah, I keep hearing that halos are rare. Another site just published a comparison of 22 pictures between the LG G6 and the Pixel. 4 of the 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the G6 pictures had halos. So it's not so rare, unless you think 18% of photos is rare. whispy_snippet I have a Pixel. I've experienced the halo effect maybe twice ever. I barely see it because you don't generally shoot straight into strong light sources because it results in crappy shots with any camera. The most important thing for me is user experience. What's the device like to use and own on a daily basis? The Pixel is exceptional in this metric. Great software, great ergonomics, great camera, regular updates, excellent performance. The S8 looks really beautiful, but I see UX compromises everywhere. The off centre, rear mounted fingerprint scanner next to the camera; the glass back; the curved edge display; two voice assistants (yes, they don't fully overlap but Samsung's end goal will be to bump Google Assistant). The S8 is just another new phone. Semianonymous Having voice control over the camera can actually be pretty useful. I have the speak to capture feature enabled on my S7 and it's enabled me to capture some tricky shots that might not have turned out as nicely if I had moved my hand to take the shot. If it's intelligent enough to do stuff like recognize the target and focus/zoom etc, then that could be potentially be really cool. Renan I'd wish Samsung would made a flat version of this... I find the Edge... edges useless. mchalakov Dear Samsung, Just because you think that a curved screen is really cool(it is but just for a presentation) doesn't mean that everybody will like it. Also who the fuck decided it's a good idea to put the fingerprint reader there? Best wishes and less explosions, Yours (some) part of the Internet PVL_93_RU To think that if Samsung didn't keep the archaic home and capacitive buttons for as long as they did - many more of their devices could look just as beautiful as S8 Teja The best thing I like about S8 is that they have made it without compromising on any of the features from their last generation despite having a big change in design. *cough* Headphone Jack *cough* Rocket Can I give this post more than one like? Teja haha. thank you :P Stadi I don't like the polished frame. Shiny metal has been out of fashion for some time. gacl I'm disappointed the S8 has no s-pen stylus support. It seems like Samsung deliberately withheld that to justify a separate Note8, but the Note line is basically the same as the Galaxy line. The S8+ is already a phablet. Just merge the two. Or at least let Galaxy users get s-pen support even if the device doesn't hold the pen internally. trapchan kinda underwhelming. no under screen fingerprint sensor, same kind of screen as LG G6, same camera as S7, and the "scream quality" thing is not even close to iPhone. Compare the charging port and speaker hole side by side, and you'll know which one "scream quality". Đức Thành It certainly looks nice, but I have a feeling it's still more gimmicky than functional. For example, most people would have this phone in a case, because if they don't, it's going to scratch very easily—so there's no real point to it looking that pretty. And those curved edges look great, but does it make it more useful or less? I'd say less, and a few drops will prove how this was not the best choice to make. I understand why Samsung decided to go with these, though, much in the same vein they go with the current approach to software: They need to sell products, and this is a marketing strategy that seems to be working quite well. That's not to say there isn't a better approach, though. This will take time, but eventually when people have wised up, the products themselves will also turn into more rational choices for consumers. francoism Thank you addressing one of my biggest concerns with the Samsung devices! Their updates take forever to get pushed out and it always bugged me so much. I can't wait for the Pixel 3 (sorry not sorry if being overly ambitious here) but when my contract is over next year, I'll just get an iPhone to sell off and sell that off to get that. Rocket I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-TouchWiz I can see that on a Samsung advertisement in the I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Butter font.

How is that even possible? Chris Merriman @ChrisTheDJ 06 April 2017 Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   0 Comments IF YOU'VE just taken delivery of a Google Home and thought "she sounds fit…." then you're not alone, apparently. According to a new study, one in four have fantasised about their personal assistant, be it Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant or Siri. A survey of over 1,000 UK adults who use voice technology on their smartphone, and an additional 100 Amazon Echo users, was published this week by Mindshare and the JWT ad agency. It found that 26 per cent of users "fantasised" about their assistant while 37 per cent "love their voice assistant so much they wish it was a real person". These people are, to use a technical term, tw*ts. It's not surprising that as technology becomes more advanced and human-like that our thoughts turn to whether or not they are as hot in "real life" as they sound. Already popular culture is full of examples of relationships with AI, including Raj's courtship of Siri in The Big Bang Theory and the 2013 Spike Jonze film Her. Thew survey also found that a third of respondents were excited by the idea of assistants being able to preempt and predict their "masters" needs, like some weird electronic dominatrix. We're a long way from all that of course. At the moment, Alexa can't tell the difference between two voices in the same household and treats each instance of itself in isolation, which is a far cry from the omnipotent assistant of an intelligent home. "To successfully integrate voice into their offerings, brands need to understand how the technology can simplify everyday tasks by adding value and removing friction from their experience. This is not about tech for tech's sake," said Elizabeth Cherian, UK director at JWT's Innovation Group. "Thoughtful and helpful interactions which genuinely enhance the experience will drive engagement and deeper relationships between consumers and brands." Equally, owners need to understand the need to get out from their Mum's basement and meet real girls. Jus' sayin.

By Michael Simon Staff Writer, Greenbot | Apr 6, 2017 9:01 AM PT Credit: Greenbot More like this Gboard beta gains translation skills, revamped theme selector Google finally releases Gboard for Android, bringing search to the keyboard Gboard 6.1 beta refines voice input, GIF search Video Is Alexa as good on your phone? It might have taken longer than we would have liked for the Gboard keyboard to make it to Android, but Google hasn’t rested on its laurels. Since its release in December, Google has steadily added new features and interface tweaks to Gboard on Android, and the latest update may be the biggest yet. The most noticeable change is the addition of a new toolbar option. When you tap the arrow to the left of the predictive text row (or the G button if you’ve enabled “Show Search and more” in the Search settings), you’ll see a new button that looks like a capital “I” flanked by two arrows. Tap it and you’ll enter Gboard’s new text selection mode, which turns the keyboard into a series of options related to editing text. There are copy, paste, select, home, and four arrow keys, which work together to reduce the time you need to spend messing with the text selection handles. You’ll also get a better resizable keyboard, to aid with one-handed typing on larger screens. Tap the menu icon in the toolbar (which isn’t visible in the “G” search mode for some reason) and select one-handed mode. There will be a new resizing icon that lets you make the keyboard slightly smaller and move it around in the box. Elsewhere, you’ll now be able to customize the toolbar and type in numerous new languages, and Google has also tweaked the design of the keys, adding rounded corners and shadows. In its traditional APK teardown, Android Police also spotted a few additional changes. Based on its deep dive into the code, it appears that Google may be merging handwriting mode into the main keyboard and adding a new incognito mode for those times when you don’t want you words recorded. The update is currently rolling out to users in the Play Store, but you can get it early by side-loading the Google-signed APK from APK Mirror. Just our type: Gboard is our favorite keyboard on Android, and it's great to see Google putting so much effort into it. We wouldn't be surprised to see it become the default keyboard when Android O ships this fall, but even if it's not, it'll still be one of  the first changes we make when we get a new phone. Even if you don't utilize its primary function of searching, Gboard is still a fantastic keyboard, and the new text selection mode just makes it that much better.

Make sure it stays safe. Your Google account includes email, photos, Drive documents, YouTube videos, and maybe even a Google Maps review or two. Between all those features, you've got a lot of important information packed away behind a single password. If it falls into the wrong hands, you're looking at a lot of unwelcome consequences. The good news is that Google takes online security just as seriously as you (should) do. The tech giant offers a variety of account protection and security measures designed to keep unwelcome visitors out while letting you easily log in. Sign in safely Like many other online portals, Google supports two-step verification. That means logging on to Google on a new device will require an email address, a password, and a code generated by your phone. The process places an extra barrier against anyone who might have gotten hold of your email address and password. To set up two-step verification, and access all of your other Google account security settings, head to the My Account page on the web. Click the Signing into Google link, and you can configure two-step verification, as well as changing your password and security questions if you need to. David Nield/Popular Science Google sign-in options Google will take you through its own security check-up if you want to bolster your account security. Whatever else you do to protect your account, the usual advice about choosing a strong password still applies. Make it at least 10 characters long; a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols; and ensure it's as difficult to guess as possible. Don't reuse passwords either: Choose a code that's specific to your Google account (so a data hack of a different account won't compromise your Google account as well). While you're adjusting your security settings, double-check your recovery email and phone number options too. These will help you regain access if you ever find yourself locked out of your account. Of course, you also need to make sure these accounts are well-protected and secure, or someone could use them to force a password reset on your Google account. Choose which devices have access Between your smartphone, tablet, laptop, and work computer, you probably access your Google account on several devices. On the other hand, if a computer halfway across the world is logged into your account, that's a red flag that something shady is going on. So Google lets you check on the devices that are using your account. Lower down on that same Sign-in & security page, click the Manage Settings link under the Security alerts heading. This tells Google how you want to be notified if a new computer or mobile device accesses your account. You can set it up to receive immediate alerts about suspicious activity, which can make all the difference in keeping your accounts protected. Look under Device activity & notifications to see computers, phones and tablets with access to your account. If you see something in the list you don't recognize or that you haven't used for a long time, select it and click Remove. Don't worry about being overly cautious, because you can always sign back in on those devices if you need to. David Nield/Popular Science Device removal Remove any computers and phones you haven't used in a while. The security page is not the only place you can find a screen like this. There's also a link at the bottom of your Gmail inbox that tells you where else your account is being used. Click on the Details link in Gmail, and you can sign out of all the other currently active sessions on the list. We also recommend doing a regular audit of third-party apps connected to your Gmail, which again can be done from the Sign-in & security page. While these apps can be useful for improving your Gmail experience, the fewer you have connected, the better from a security standpoint. So get rid of any apps that you don't use regularly or haven't used in a long time. Secure your smartphone If you have an Android phone, your Google account is tied pretty tightly to it, so it's important to review your security settings here too. Whatever type of phone you have, you should be putting up barriers via its lock screen. But on Android phones, you can find some extra security settings specific to your Google account. From the Settings app, tap Google then Security. You'll see some of the same options we've mentioned above, as well as a few extra ones. You can, for example, turn on the feature that lets you remotely locate your phone from a computer, which can come in very handy if someone else gets hold of it. We'd also advise turning the Verify apps feature on, as this monitors for suspicious activity in the apps you've installed on your device. David Nield/Popular Science Android Smart Lock Android includes several tricks for keeping your phone secure. If you go to Settings then Security, you can turn on an Android feature called Smart Lock, which lets you specify certain places where the lock screen is disabled. That way you don't have to bother with a password when you're in the safety of your own home. (You can also set up your phone to be used in place of a password on a Chromebook—perhaps a glimpse of the password-free future we can all look forward to.) Once someone gets into your phone, apps like Gmail and Chrome are wide open, so it's important to have a lengthy PIN code or fingerprint protection in place to stop that from happening. If your devices do fall into the wrong hands, use Android Device Manager to lock and wipe them remotely before any damage is done. Preserve your privacy Sometimes the line gets blurred between security (keeping people out of your account) and privacy (controlling what you're sharing about yourself). Even if you set up solid layers of security to protect yourself from hackers, you might want to put walls between your online identity and Google itself, which collects lots of data about your search habits and more. Luckily, Google has plenty of options you can explore in both categories. From the My Account screen, click Personal info & privacy to make an audit of what Google knows about you. You'll find lots to explore here: You can wipe your Google search history (even if you regularly clear your browser history, Google logs your searches independently), stop Google from tracking your location, and even personalize the sorts of ads you see on Google services. David Nield/Popular Science Google privacy settings Google gives you simple controls for limiting the data it collects about you. For example, click on Go To Activity Controls and then click Manage Activity under YouTube History to review and delete any searches you've carried out on the video sharing site. Meanwhile, if you want to pause any of the data-collecting Google is doing, use the simple toggle switches on the Activity Controls screen. It's easy enough to sift through, and where necessary delete, the information Google has collected about your online habits. It ultimately comes down to how much you trust Google. For clarification on how it uses that data, you can read Google's privacy policy online. For example, those YouTube searches are used to recommend new videos you might like, and that location history lets Google do smart stuff such as tell you about commute times to the office. But it's up to you where you draw the line. Online security has never been more important. For more information, check out our guide to protecting all your accounts.

With Google Strategic Partner Manager Matt Targett, members of the MassLive Media team discussed ways businesses can target their customers better and use data to sell their products and services. A group of more than 20 people asked about the best ways to use Internet tools to learn more about their audience and capture more customers over coffee and breakfast. MassLive Media Director of Digital Solutions Rob Madrid explained to guests how their businesses can use "big data" to learn more about their customer base. Targett talked about how businesses can take advantage of "micro-moments," reaching customers and clients when they are most receptive to doing business. The breakfast also featured remarks from MassLive President Tim Kennedy about the constantly changing landscape of media and the Internet.  MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive on YouTube Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

Google hopeful the mobile-first index will launch by year’s end But Gary Illyes says it might not go live until 2018. Barry Schwartz on April 6, 2017 at 10:39 am More Kashin / Shutterstock.com In November 2016, Google launched their mobile-first index experiment and hoped to do enough testing to launch it sometime in the near future. Well, it seems this mobile-first index has proven to be a challenge for Google, and they may not even launch it this year. At the Next10x Conference in Boston yesterday, Gary Illyes from Google said that while the team is hopeful that they will launch the mobile-first index by the end of the year, he feels that it is unlikely. We asked Gary to confirm, and he told us that he did indeed say that at the event. He said the team working on the mobile-first index at Google “would like to launch by end of the year,” but Gary added he thinks “that’s unlikely to happen, at least fully.” So if you are anxious about the mobile-first index going live with Google, there’s no need to panic right now — you have some time to get ready.

Published: 18:01 April 6, 2017 Naushad K. Cherrayil, Staff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: Nokia is here for the long run and sees a bright feature for its smartphones after making a comeback, the regional head of HMD Global told Gulf News in an interview. “We believe the partners who are with us are in it for a long run. That is the commitment we have,” said Per Ekman, Vice-President for Middle East and North Africa at HMD Global, the company that owns the rights to sell Nokia-branded smartphones and tablets for 10 years. It develops, builds and sells the phones with inputs from Nokia. Ekman said the unique proposition and the strategic partnerships with trade partners such as Foxconn, Nokia and Google are going to be the key differentiators. “Most of the smartphones in the market do not have the Android OS in the way it should be. Vendors are adding a skin on top of the OS. Consumers have the right to have the latest version of the OS and we will be pushing the latest version and the patches as soon as it is available from Google,” he said. He added that users will find the true Nokia brand attitudes such as reliability, simplicity, ease of use, human touch and quality in the devices. “We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant,” Ekman said. At its peak in 2008, Nokia was the world’s top mobile phone company. It shipped 468 million handsets, of which 60 million were smartphones. It had a mobile market share of whopping 41 per cent then, compared to the current leader Samsung which just had a 19 per cent share in 2016. Nokia lost its leadership position in 2011 to Samsung and in 2014, sold its business to Microsoft for $7.2 billion (Dh26.44 billion). But the company is still making the feature [basic] phones which are still used in many countries, especially in Africa. According to research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), 215.33 million mobile handsets were shipped in Africa during 2016. Out of this, feature phones totalled 119.97 million units with a 16.1 per cent year-on-year increase compared to 3.4 per cent year-on-year increase in smartphone shipments to 95.37 million units. This growth saw feature phones increase their unit share of Africa’s overall handset market from 53 per cent in 2015 to 56 per cent in 2016. “Feature phones are still a sizeable business globally. In the region, Nokia has a market share of between six and seven per cent,” Ekman said. He added that Nokia tested the launch this year in January in the toughest market — China, with Nokia 6, to see if customers are happy with the brand and the device. HMD sold more than one million handsets in pre-registration within 23 seconds of the announcement in China. “It is a fantastic opportunity that we have now. Android is the consumer choice for the smartphone platform. Symbian and Microsoft were more of a niche platform, and did not deal with the consumer appeal in terms of apps,” he said. The first wave of products to hit the market in this quarter is Nokia 3, Nokia 5, Nokia 6 and Nokia 3310. He did not give the exact date or month of launch but industry experts say the launch would happen by the end of May or early June in 120 markets.

Pratham Books StoryWeaver, Pratham Education Foundation, Million Sparks Foundation and Learning Equality are the four NGOs that will receive the grants over the next two years "to expand and scale the work" they have been doing. "We believe technology can help bridge the gap, it can get more books to students, more lesson plans to teachers, and classrooms to kids who can't get there themselves," Nick Cain, Programme Manager at Google.Org, said. According to the company, the grants will be used to offer languge-oriented learning material, better training and support to teachers, and to support students beyond classroom learning. The Million Sparks Foundations with its digital content platform and social community 'ChalkLit' provides teachers with lessons plans, learning modules and videos, which are organised in accordance with the government certified curriculum standards. In December last year, the NGO was selected by Delhi State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) and currently provides training to over 60,000 school teachers through the ChalkLit app. "Our vision is to create a platform using which anyone can teach a child one lesson at a time. What we are trying to create are bite-sized curriculum-aligned sources, which are basically around one particular chapter. We are trying to create resources that are 360 degree learning solutions," Abhinav Mathur, Founder-Director, Million Sparks Foundation, said. While Pratham Education's hybrid learning program provides students with "self-driven" tablet-based solution, Pratham Books' StoryWeaver is an open-source online platform which allows teachers and parents to create and translate stories in over 67 languages. "So far we have provided about 26,000 children with 2,400 tablets in 400 villages of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The cost of this model is USD 10 per year per child, which is quite less compared to government's spending of USD 250 per year per child on primary education," Vinod Khanna of Pratham Education said. In association with local partner Motivation for Excellence, Learning Equality aims to "help educators access, organize and customize digital content, even in the most remote locations" through their platform 'Kolibri'.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Use a 64-bit Web Browser on Windows By Chris Hoffman on April 6th, 2017 Google and Mozilla now offer 64-bit versions of Chrome and Firefox for Windows. Here’s how to find out what version you’re running and how to upgrade. Most platforms use 64-bit browsers by default when you’re using a 64-bit operating system. 64-bit web browsers tend to be faster and more secure thanks to the additional security features available. Unfortunately, if you’re running Windows, you may not get the 64-bit version of your browser automatically. To make the move, you first need to ensure that you’re running a 64-bit version of Windows. You also need to make sure that you don’t rely on any old browser plugins that are only available in 32-bit. After that, you’ll just need to download and install the 64-bit version of whatever browser you use. RELATED ARTICLES What’s the Difference Between 32-bit and 64-bit Windows? Why the 64-bit Version of Windows is More Secure Step One: Make Sure You’re Running 64-bit Windows RELATED ARTICLE How Do I Know if I’m Running 32-bit or 64-bit Windows? You’ll need a 64-bit version of Windows to run a 64-bit web browser. To check which version you’re running on Windows 7, 8, or 10, navigate to Control Panel > System and Security > System. On the right side of the window, check the “System type” entry. It will tell you whether you’re using a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system. RELATED ARTICLE How to Switch From 32-bit Windows 10 to 64-bit Windows 10 If you see that you’re using a 32-bit version of Windows on a x64-based processor, you can probably switch to the 64-bit version of Windows. If your system has a 32-bit processor, you can’t install a 64-bit operating system and won’t be able to use a 64-bit browser. Step Two: Check for Old Browser Plug-Ins RELATED ARTICLE How to Use Java, Silverlight, and Other Plugins in Modern Browsers Some older browser plug-ins only function in 32-bit browsers. However, the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge don’t support browser plug-ins aside from Flash, anyway. So there’s no downside to switching if you’re running one of these new browsers. You can still use normal browser extensions with these browsers—just not “plugins” like Java and Silverlight. Step Three: Update Your Browser to 64-bit After making sure that you’re running a 64-bit version of Windows and that you don’t rely on any old 32-bit-only browser plugins, it’s time to update to the 64-bit browser of your choice. Google Chrome Google released a 64-bit version of Google Chrome back in 2014. However, Google didn’t automatically upgrade everyone to the 64-bit version of Google Chrome, so you may still be running the 32-bit version. If you are, you should definitely upgrade to the 64-bit version of Chrome. It’s faster and more secure. RELATED ARTICLES You Should Upgrade to 64-bit Chrome. It’s More Secure, Stable, and Speedy How to Tell If You Have the 32-bit or 64-Bit Version of Google Chrome To check if you’re running the 64-bit version of Google Chrome, open the Settings menu and head to Help > About. Look to the right of the version number. If you see “(64-bit)” at the end, you’re running the 64-bit version. If you don’t, you’re running the 32-bit version. To upgrade, head to the Chrome download page, download the 64-bit version for Windows, and install it. You won’t lose any of your Chrome settings when you upgrade. Mozilla Firefox RELATED ARTICLE How to Check if You Are Running a 32-bit or 64-bit Version of Firefox Mozilla released a 64-bit version of Firefox at the end of 2015. However, like Google, Mozilla hasn’t automatically upgraded everyone to the 64-bit version of Firefox. You may still be running the 32-bit version. To check if you’re running the 64-bit version of Firefox, open the Settings menu and head to Help > About Firefox (The “Help” button is the question mark icon at the bottom of the menu). You’ll see either “(32-bit)” or “(64-bit)” displayed to the right of the version number here. To upgrade, head to the Firefox download page, click “Firefox for Other Platforms & Languages”, download the 64-bit version for Windows, and install it. You won’t lose any of your Firefox settings when you upgrade. Microsoft Edge Microsoft Edge is always a 64-bit application on 64-bit versions of Windows 10, so you don’t need to worry about it. Internet Explorer Microsoft provides both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer on 64-bit versions of Windows. On a 64-bit version of Windows 10, the standard “Internet Explorer” shortcut in your Start menu launches the 64-bit version of Internet Explorer. So, just use the default and you’ll be using a 64-bit browser. If you want to find the 32-bit version of Internet Explorer, open a File Explorer window and browse to C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer. Launch the “iexplore.exe” program from here and you’ll get the 32-bit version of IE. On a 64-bit version of Windows 7, you’ll see two different shortcuts in your Start menu. One is named simply “Internet Explorer,” and it launches the 32-bit version. The other shortcut is named “Internet Explorer (64-bit),” and it launches the 64-bit version. In the Windows 7 days, browsers used traditional NPAPI and ActiveX browser plugins, which did not work well in 32-bit. Windows made the 32-bit Internet Explorer the default so that people would run into fewer problems. Now that those browser plugins have mostly been abandoned, you shouldn’t notice any problems while running the 64-bit version. Whatever the rationale for not automatically updating capable PCs with the 64-bit versions of web browsers, it’s generally better to run a 64-bit version if you can. It offers greater speed and security. Fortunately, it’s easy enough to make the switch if your system can handle it.

CFO Staff April 6, 2017 | CFO Magazine share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Venture capital money is flowing freely. Cloud infrastructure is enabling startup companies to operate on scant fixed investment. Next-generation technologies are promising to revolutionize business processes. In many ways, it is a boon time for enterprise technology. But for finance chiefs trying to pick their way through whitepapers, conferences, product pitches, and webinars, the array of products and vendors can be dizzying. And new companies pop up continually, making it difficult to keep up with the latest and greatest. To give CFOs a sense of the exciting tech developments going on, as well as alert them to innovative solutions, the editors of CFO decided to filter the marketing noise generated by tech firms. The goal was to produce a short list of promising companies and applications geared toward the next-generation enterprise. Since CFOs have a large hand in technology adoption, we considered solutions for finance as well as other parts of the organization. The result is our first-ever list of 20 tech companies to watch, determined solely by the editorial team. Why did we select the companies on the following pages? We think they offer compelling products that address definable pain points in many businesses, and while many of these vendors are privately held, they look to be formidable players in their categories. In choosing a company, the editors do not vouch for the quality, cost-effectiveness, or reliability of its products—that level of analysis is beyond our technological capabilities. Instead, we are indicating that the solution or product category chosen deserves a CFO’s attention and warrants further research. We are also suggesting that, if one of these company names shows up on a manager’s expense report or a business unit’s budget, a CFO would be smart to explore whether the solution can provide value to other parts of the organization. Plenty of other companies could have made our list, but for better or worse, the ones on the following pages are those we deem worthy of examination in 2017. The profiles were written by deputy editors David M. Katz and David McCann, web editor Sean Allocca, and editor-in-chief Vincent Ryan. Avalara HEADACHE REMEDY Unhappy customers, goods that sit idle in warehouses, visits from revenue auditors, class-action lawsuits—those are the dangers of calculating sales and other indirect taxes incorrectly. But keeping track of all the changes from thousands of state and local, as well as international, tax jurisdictions to collect and pay the accurate amount is time-consuming and complicated. Enter Avalara and its products that simplify sales tax compliance. The Avalara solution sits within a customer’s financial, billing, e-commerce, or point-of-sale system and delivers tax calculations in real time over the Internet. It validates the physical transaction address and uses geolocation technology to calculate the tax. Avalara does this for U.S. sales taxes, the goods and services taxes (GST) in Canada and other countries, value-added taxes (VAT), and excise taxes. “We capture all the complexity and variations across countries and U.S. states, and we’ve implemented into software code a range of different taxes and made it simple and affordable,” says Richard Asquith, Avalara’s vice president of global indirect tax. What Avalara does well—accuracy combined with speed—is becoming crucial in the indirect tax arena. “The days of submitting a U.S. sales tax or VAT return months after doing a transaction, which allows lots of time to rethink everything, get the calculations right, and consult counsel, are coming to an end,” says Asquith. “Through digitization, taxing authorities are able to peer into transactions through live feeds from ERP and accounting systems.” Using analytics, revenue auditors can check the calculations of tax rates and reconcile those to tax receipts, Asquith says. “We’re starting to see tax audits where the tax authorities know more than the CFO, because the authorities have the comparable matching transactions from throughout the supply chain.” Internationally, this is happening in various forms in China, Brazil, Spain, and Poland, and is starting to arrive in the United States, Asquith adds. Another pressing issue Avalara addresses for companies is cross-border e-commerce sales. Businesses selling into another state or foreign country to a consumer often have to pay customs duties or local sales or import taxes. But if the e-commerce provider doesn’t calculate and settle the tax before the product ships, the delivery service has to collect the tax from the customer. Asquith calls it a “choke point” for small firms selling goods online. “Our Landed Cost product is one of our fastest-growing products at the moment,” says Asquith. Besides providing tools for calculating, reporting, and filing, Avalara advises companies on whether they have a “nexus,” and therefore a tax obligation, in a particular state. “Companies going national or global can choose to license our software or employ our tax teams and outsource tax compliance,” Asquith says. How does Avalara keep up with about 10,000 U.S. taxing jurisdictions and tax rules in 200 countries? Avalara has tax accountants and tax lawyers scouring tax authority websites for updates and publications, researching court cases, and staying alert for legislative changes. In addition, since its founding in 2004, Avalara has acquired 17 companies, many of which specialize in tax compliance for specific localities and industries. The company landed $96 million in funding in 2016, so it may continue to roll up other providers of tax compliance engines. An initial public offering may also be on the horizon. “Having to maintain all the records and reports needed for filing returns was a headache we no longer have,” writes one user of Avalara’s products on the G2 Crowd peer-to-peer software review forum. “We have freed up at least 50 hours per month that we now put to better use.” —Vincent Ryan Automation Anywhere FRONT AND BACK In a global business environment where companies are fixated on automation and grow more so by the day, a software vendor could certainly choose a worse name than Automation Anywhere. There is such a company, and it has a lot more going for it than its name. Automation Anywhere is the clear market leader in the burgeoning field of robotic process automation (RPA), and 2017 is shaping up as a year when demand for RPA could explode. Automation Anywhere counts 27 channel partnerships that generate about 50% of its revenue, but it didn’t get where it is via crafty marketing. Forrester Research ranks it first, among many strong competitors, in both the strength of its product and the strength of its overall strategy. Everest Group, another analyst firm, recently identified the company as one of two RPA players that are market leaders and “star performers” in a matrix evaluation of vendors’ product features, implementation quality, and impact on the market. There’s no doubt the company has had an impact: Automation Anywhere says it has more than 500 enterprise clients worldwide and that it experienced net growth of 167 customers in 2016. Like other RPA vendors, it sells robotics software designed to automatically replicate keystrokes that humans make to complete back-office processes. In the case of Automation Anywhere, such processes include procure-to-pay, quote-to-cash, human resources administration, and claims processing. But Automation Anywhere works in the front office too, with “good depth” in call-center and other customer-service environments, where humans interact with bots, according to Forrester analyst Craig Le Clair. In fact, Le Clair says that’s the single thing that most distinguishes the company from its competition. “Most of these companies specialized in or evolved from either the back office or front office, but Automation Anywhere has struck a balance,” he says. The company is also balanced across several important RPA performance categories, including strength in desktop integration and in the analytics that drive reporting capabilities, Le Clair says. He adds that Automation Anywhere “has a good road map for analytics in the future.” CEO Mihir Shukla refers to the company’s mission as building a global “digital workforce.” He says Automation Anywhere has deployed 450,000 bots to date and is aiming to have 3 million placed by 2020. That kind of growth augurs a potential transformation for companies’ decisions on where to locate operations. “The interesting thing about the digital workforce is that it’s geography-neutral—once it happens anywhere, it can happen everywhere,” Shukla tells CFO. Shukla talks frequently about instilling cognitive capabilities and artificial intelligence into the company’s products, but at present those initiatives are in their early stages. The company recently released a capability called IQ Bot, which offers machine learning—that is, the technology continually monitors the keystrokes humans make to complete processes and thereby improves bot performance without the need for additional programming by humans. But to many observers, that’s not artificial intelligence. “All RPA today is what I call obtuse RPA,” says Le Clair. “It handles dumb tasks, there’s no decision-making, and the rules are static.” But Le Clair suggests that AI will arrive in the RPA space within two or three years. “It will allow bots to handle advanced exceptions, making decisions about taking one path or another,” he says. —David McCann FinancialForce RECOGNIZING OPPORTUNITY With President Donald Trump’s executive order requiring federal agencies to cut two regulations for every one they issue and with at least three regulatory reform bills launched in Congress, slashing governmental red tape is very much the rage. The many executives who have long complained about regulations’ stranglehold on their businesses apparently have a good chance of getting their way. Yet for other companies, new rules and standards aren’t such a bad thing—in fact, they might provide ample fuel for growth. FinancialForce, an enterprise resource planning vendor with apps that sprouted from the cloud-based platform of Salesforce, is a case in point. FinancialForce expects a big sales boost from the new revenue recognition reporting standard that will go into effect over the next few years. “From a business perspective, it’s frankly a boon to us,” says CFO John Bonney. Public companies are hustling to comply with the complicated standard, which they must start applying to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. That deadline puts FinancialForce in the catbird seat, Bonney thinks. Under the standard, companies must match a range of performance obligations to revenue. “You can’t charge somebody $0 for a widget and $100 for the services [enabled by the widget] and pretend that the widget doesn’t have any revenue,” the CFO says. Many companies today have multi-element revenue arrangements, including both products and services, that include different kinds of billing for each element. Bonney contends that the firm’s billing and revenue recognition software “allows users to isolate each element of the relationship they have” with clients to make it easier to comply with the new standard. Thus, the firm is currently seeing its greatest demand for and growth in its revenue management and recognition apps, according to Bonney. Aiming to automate the administrative functions of health care, real estate, management consulting, and other professional services organizations, the vendor’s offerings also include accounting and finance, spending, inventory, and talent management tools. Overall, FinancialForce is growing strongly, according to a vendor profile by IDC. “The company has consistently been in the top five of growing technology vendors in the ERP market,” according to the report, which noted that FinancialForce has more than 650 employees worldwide, as well as 1,300 customers. Late last year, FinancialForce reported that it expected to reach a run rate of $100 million in revenue early in 2017. Asserting that the company is growing just north of 40% a year in revenue, Bonney notes that it’s at an inflection point. That means FinancialForce must ramp up to meet its next goal: becoming a $1 billion company. FinancialForce will face obstacles on the way to its next milestone. The main challenge is that it is still a relatively young company, according to IDC. Although “the team is adding functionality to its solutions very quickly, it has very stiff competition as it seeks to win over enterprise customers.” In competing for such high-end business, FinancialForce “will need to cater to a wide variety of localities and regulatory environments and eventually forge partnerships outside the Salesforce platform,” according to the profile. That’s a lot to ask of a firm with fewer than 1,000 employees, IDC acknowledges. But FinancialForce’s recent success “proves that the company is on the right track.” —David M. Katz Sprinklr BACK TO THE FUTURE Sprinklr thinks it knows what the future looks like. The company is trying to spark an evolution in customer relationship management by collecting and leveraging social-media data alongside traditional CRM information. Imagine a system like Salesforce that also collects data about customers from their tweets and Facebook posts. Sprinklr manages more than 4 billion social connections in 150 countries and mines some two dozen social media channels for information about clients’ individual customers. Sprinklr incorporates that data directly into a client’s existing CRM system. The company co-exists with industry Goliaths, like Salesforce and products from Adobe and Oracle, and provides extra value for businesses that are looking to include social media in their advertising and marketing campaigns. With more than 1,300 employees in 14 offices worldwide, the six-year-old company now lists 9 of the world’s 10 most valuable global brands as clients, including the likes of Nike, McDonald’s, and Microsoft. Annualized recurring revenue hit the $100 million mark in 2015, up 150% from the prior period. “We’re in a very interesting space,” says Carlos Dominguez, Sprinklr president and COO. While the “big players” already supply CRM systems, “they really don’t do social.” The social media management platform mines posts on well-known channels, from Facebook to LinkedIn to the European social media service VK. Dominguez says clients can use the information to do things such as reach out to customers with highly targeted email campaigns or provide a more personalized experience when customers call company help lines. In one example, a customer called Nike inquiring about a pair of shoes that hadn’t been delivered on time. The agent quickly used social networking information from Sprinklr to learn that the woman was running in an upcoming marathon. The agent took the opportunity to sell her additional merchandise. Dominguez says the $200 pair of running shoes turned into a $400 purchase. In July, the company raised $105 million in funding led by the Singapore-based investment firm Temasek. The capital might be used to help feed Sprinklr’s healthy merger appetite. The company has acquired 11 businesses to date, 10 in the past two years alone. The laundry list of tech start-ups includes Postano, a social media visualization platform, and Little Bird, an audience insight company. Sprinklr has raised $239 million in funding and is currently valued at $1.8 billion. In addition, Sprinklr rewrote the code for these acquired technologies from scratch, meaning clients can spend less time integrating applications or worrying about customer service, thus saving time and money, Dominguez says. The most recent acquisitions allow Sprinklr to tailor its services to some of its most prominent clients. Little Bird, for example, helps brands discover top influencers who can promote a company by word of mouth. As for the future, business spending on social media is expected to reach $27.4 billion by 2020, according to Forrester Research. That includes in-feed and out-of-feed ads on social networks as well as agency fees and technology spending. If that market projection proves accurate, it represents a 122% surge from the $12.3 billion spent in 2015. Until then, Sprinklr is patiently waiting. “Our greatest risk is that we’re looking at the world in a future-backwards way,” Dominguez says. Although Sprinklr already calls half of all Fortune 50 companies clients, there remains a learning curve when teaching prospective patrons the value of leveraging social data. In fact, many companies are just not ready to take the plunge. “We spend an inordinate amount of time educating and showing folks what the new world will look like,” Dominguez says. “We know where the future is and we’re helping clients get there.” —Sean Allocca Oomnitza TRACKER OF ‘THINGS’ Most vendors of IT management services focus mainly on “things” that by now are considered at least a generation or more old: desktop computers, laptops, cell phones, and servers. Oomnitza, which raised a modest $2.3 million of funding in 2014 and since then has grown quickly, has a software-as-a-service subscription offering flexible enough to manage a lot more than laptops and cell phones: its product manages the sensors and other new-age capital equipment that make up the Internet of Things. One Oomnitza client, for example, provides geospatial information tools; Oomnitza manages its lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) aerial mapping systems. Another customer offers turnkey systems for outfitting trade shows with equipment. Oomnitza also manages prototype self-driving cars for an automaker, and Internet-powered information kiosks for a city government. It even works with a major brewer that installs sensors in its kegs, taps, and refrigeration units. How can a software program be that flexible? “A server, a self-driving car, and lidar equipment seem very different from the outside,” says Oomnitza CEO Arthur Lozinski. “But when you think about managing them they are quite similar, because they go through similar steps.” That’s a reference to the essence of IT asset management. Oomnitza’s software tracks the lifecycle of those devices and objects—from the time they’re budgeted pre-purchase, all the way to archiving the data generated by obsolete assets earmarked for destruction. The software allows customers to track where assets are, who has control of them, whether they’re working or need maintenance, and so on. The software also allows users to run reports on any of those variables. Oomnitza started serving its first 10 customers in 2014. It landed them through cold-calling. “Our first customer management system consisted of printed-out company logos along with the names of the CIOs and IT managers we wanted to talk to at those companies,” says Lozinski. “Six months later we had an entire wall covered with logos of customers we had signed on.” The company has done no marketing to date, and no analysts have written reports on it. It relies on a proactive sales approach and word of mouth. “Lots of people come to us because they have a friend at a company that uses us, or they used us at a previous company,” the CEO says. While Oomnitza has moved far beyond simply tracking computers and cell phones, its success in that area is a harbinger of continued broader growth. “Somehow they cracked the code on how to handle those devices and made it easy for companies to manage the assets,” says Timothy Chou, a former Oracle executive who teaches cloud computing at Stanford University. (He also owns shares in Oomnitza and is a frequent contributor to CFO.) “And,” Chou continues, “many future [technologies] will consist of a bunch of sensors and actuators with cell-phone-like technology sitting in the middle. The reason I say that is, just look at a cell phone: it’s a computer that has maybe a dozen sensors and it already connects to three networks—Bluetooth, 3G or 4G, and WiFi.” Given that General Electric, for example, has poured more than $1 billion into developing an IoT management business, why should we pay attention to a small, young company like Oomnitza? Because such companies often bring a new way of looking at business and create disruptive technology. “If only large players could enter markets,” Chou says, “Google wouldn’t exist. Microsoft had way more money and engineers than everyone else. Oomnitza has built modern software from the ground up that offers unique advantages in flexibility and ease of deployment.” —D.M. Workiva CONTROLS, COMPLIANCE, AND COLLABORATION The only publicly held company in CFO’s tech watchlist, Workiva has products that are as essential to the offices of the CFO and the controller as oxygen is. The company’s Wdesk cloud-based platform features proprietary word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation applications built on top of a data management engine. But don’t mistake Wdesk for a desktop application suite, because it’s in a whole other league. The platform offers synchronized data, controlled collaboration, granular permissions, and a full audit trail. Companies trust it for reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission, managing audits, and complying with Sarbanes-Oxley. Stuart Miller, CFO of Workiva, points to what differentiates the platform: it’s “massively collaborative” (several hundred people can work on the same document); it has a full audit trail (changes are perpetually time-stamped); and it features a live-linking capability, around which Workiva has built a patent. “I can open up my [earnings] press release, my script for the [earnings] call, and my board presentation and see numbers that are all driven by the same spreadsheet, and they are linked,” Miller says. “If I change a number in the spreadsheet it changes in all the other documents. It reduces ticking and tying and the chance of making an error.” Miller says CFOs like that Workiva’s platform “brings order to the chaos” of financial reporting, but the people who really “feel the pain” and thus understand the complete benefits of the platform are the finance and compliance team members assembling the reports. Workiva started its business by calling on business users and allowing them to sign quarterly contracts. But once several groups within an organization adopt Wdesk, its IT department contacts Workiva. “The message from IT is that you need to improve your user management so I can add thousands of people instead of hundreds,” Miller says. Once Workiva is deployed, companies are saving money through lower costs of compliance. According to a Forrester Research case study, a large auto parts retailer using the Wdesk SOX solution to streamline its monitoring and testing of internal controls slashed the time to finalize a control from two weeks to two days and saved 240 hours annually on SOX certifications. The net present value per user over a three-year horizon was more than $6,000. Miller says Workiva has a 50% market share among accelerated SEC filers. It also has 480 customers for its SOX product. While Workiva started out in 2008 taking business from financial printers, its ambitions are broader now. It is being adopted by customers for auditing, risk and compliance (including Dodd-Frank stress testing), and operations (managing and tracking key performance indicators). For auditing, finance teams use the workflow capability for task assignments and a digital support binder to attach substantiating documents for auditors. Workiva is also working on a data application programming interface to enterprise resource planning systems. “If you run analytics outside of ERP, you have to get that data out. Companies have been dumping it into Excel spreadsheets, but the data is too large for Excel spreadsheets,” says Miller, forcing companies to export it piecemeal and reassemble it. Workiva’s API will allow users to dump an entire trial balance into the Wdesk cloud-based spreadsheet. Workiva spends about 30% of revenue on R&D, but it’s also trying to meet Wall Street’s expectations. The $200 million company is posting quarterly net losses, and its sales growth slowed in 2016, to 23%. According to analysts, though, non-SEC use cases of Workiva’s platform could constitute half of the company’s bookings in 2017. —V.R. SecurityScorecard KEEPING SCORE The spark for SecurityScorecard, a firm that rates companies based on their cyber defenses, was kindled when Aleksandr Yampolskiy suddenly realized that he could be fired. That fact dawned on Yampolskiy when he was chief information security officer of Gilt Groupe. The shopping website was considering doing business with a firm that analyzed e-commerce to unearth potential fraud. Under the arrangement, Gilt Groupe would have had to share all of its customer data with the analytics firm. As part of the vetting process, Yampolskiy’s team looked at a copy of the 30-page questionnaire that the analytics firm had filled out as part of Gilt Groupe’s security audit. “It looked great, and they answered all the questions positively,” he recalls. But when he asked his team to “poke around” publicly available data to find out about the company’s security vulnerabilities, “at the last minute we found that there was unencrypted credit card data, [which meant] that we could lose all our customer information if we partnered with them.” Previously, Yampolskiy believed that if you worked hard and did a good job, then you should be promoted, regardless of outcomes based on external circumstances. But after his team unearthed the credit card risk, “for the first time I felt that if one of the cloud services that I used got hacked, then I could be fired,” he said. That led him to ask himself a question: To reduce career risks like the one he’d faced, was it possible to rate the security risks of vendors in the way that credit rating agencies rate borrowers? The result was SecurityScorecard. Founded in 2013 by Yampolskiy and Sam Kassoumeh, the former head of security and compliance at Gilt Groupe, the software-as-a-service provider collects “thousands of signals every second” regarding the cybersecurity of companies. After gathering that data via a proprietary search engine and subscription services, the firm then assigns a company a letter grade from A to F. In language that’s a bit thick with tech jargon, the firm’s website gives an overview of the sources its search engine scans: “malware analysis pipelines, monitored hacker chatter crawlers, honeypot/sinkhole infrastructures, vulnerability cadence checkers, and deep social engineering sensors.” The idea of the grades is to give CFOs and security professionals a quick way to limit their employers’ exposures to vulnerable vendors. “They can do business only with those companies they believe can do a good job in maintaining the security of data,” Yampolskiy says. They can also limit their relationships with vendors that have weak cybersecurity practices or avoid them altogether. Although the cybersecurity-rating market is in its infancy, competition is picking up. SecurityScorecard’s prime rival, BitSight, was launched two years earlier and appears to have an equally good reputation for the accuracy of its grades. Last June, FICO, the well-known credit score provider, signaled its entry into the business with the acquisition of QuadMetrics, a firm that uses predictive analytics to rate an organization’s cyber defenses. For its part, SecurityScorecard has been making impressive strides of late. In 2016, the firm secured $20 million in funding from GV (formerly Google Ventures) to go with the $12.5 million provided by Sequoia Capital the prior year. Early in 2017, it announced two efforts that could boost its sales and marketing. In January, it launched a channel partner program aimed at resellers that can find new markets for its services. And in February the firm announced that it was launching Malware Grader, a free security rating tool built on its broader platform. Given their informational tight-fistedness, it’s almost impossible to confirm the competitive claims of firms in the cyber ratings space. SecurityScorecard, at any rate, touts a big advantage in the scope of its ratings. “We have over 100,000 companies that we rate on a daily basis. Nobody else has that,” Yampolskiy says. —D.M.K. Slack YOU HAVEN’T GOT MAIL For a company attempting the almost impossible feat of toppling traditional email platforms, the enterprise-messaging company Slack is off to a capable start. The San Francisco–based startup launched with only 16,000 users in February 2014, but at the time it raised $200 million in April 2016 it was valued at nearly $4 billion. In truth, Slack has grown so explosively it’s probably better suited to a unicorns-likely-to-price list. The company now claims 77 Fortune 100 companies as clients. Slack also made some waves late last year by partnering with more mature companies like Google and IBM—moves that could continue to fuel its meteoric growth. Slack’s secret is its simplicity. The platform lets users keep track of their messages by organizing them into channels. Instead of sending individual emails that get lost in inboxes, users can communicate directly with colleagues in real time. The conversations are searchable and highly transparent, although they can also be private. The company even rolled out voice and video chatting to users last year. According to Slack, its plug-ins, including popular ones for Trello, Skype, and Dropbox, are downloaded 415,000 times each month, making it one of the fastest-growing enterprise-messaging companies. But Slack’s simplicity doesn’t stop at messaging. The platform also allows users to share files by dragging them from the desktop and dropping them directly into the Slack app. It’s that efficiency and integration that Slack is betting on to boost growth in 2017. In December, the company announced a partnership with Google to incorporate some of the best-loved Google services into its platform. Millions of Google Drive files are shared on Slack each month, the company said. But, previously, requests to access and edit those files still had to pass through traditional venues, namely email. The partnership integrates those popular Google services into Slack’s app. Slack also teamed up with IBM and its cognitive-computing platform, Watson. Slack hopes the artificial intelligence system will improve troubleshooting on its customer service platform by learning what answers work best for its users. “We want Slack to become better and smarter the more you use it,” said CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield, who previously co-founded the photo-sharing website Flickr. Finally, in January 2017 Slack launched Enterprise Grid, a version geared toward large enterprises that features an unlimited number of workspaces and gives IT administrators the ability to add new layers of security and identity management. At launch, Snap also announced a portfolio of bots to integrate with SAP services, including a Concur travel and expense bot and a bot that connects with the HANA cloud platform. With seven offices, including locations in Dublin, London, and Melbourne, Slack is hoping to expand its influence beyond the U.S. There are about 5 million daily active users on Slack, 1.5 million of whom pay, and the company is looking for more. Almost half of Slack’s daily active users are from countries outside North America, mostly in the UK, Japan, and Germany. In posts on peer-to-peer software review site G2 Crowd, users say they like Slack’s integration with other apps and its usability, especially the ability to share files and pin important messages. But some users also consider Slack expensive, at $6.67 per month per active user (although there is a free version). So, is Slack the answer to traditional email services? According to a survey conducted by the company, Slack users cut back on company emails by 50% when using the product. While that seems like it could take a significant chunk out of traditional email services, only time will tell if Slack will deliver. —S.A. DocuSign DOCUMENT DUMP The global market for e-signature technology currently tops out at about $500 million annually, according to some estimates. So how has DocuSign, even though it’s the market leader with an estimated 30% to 40% share, managed to pocket $500 million in funding? What justifies the unicorn’s $3 billion valuation? In large part it’s about the potential to further reduce companies’ reliance on paper documents and thereby trigger large efficiencies and cost savings. E-signature has been a fast-growing niche for several years, and DocuSign says the volume of transactions it facilitated increased by 70% in 2016 alone. But that pace will inevitably wind down, so the company is forging ahead with an agenda to take on management of a much broader array of digital transactions. “A tremendous number of business activities are still burdened by paper and analog processes, and DocuSign is well-positioned to help companies digitize them,” says Forrester Research analyst Craig Le Clair. Daniel Singer, an experienced public-company CEO, came aboard as DocuSign’s chief executive in January, replacing Keith Krach, who remains the company’s chairman. Wall Street has been anticipating an IPO, and the only thing standing in the way is Singer’s wish to get comfortable with the predictability of earnings, he says. “The core things required for [software-as-a-service] companies to go public are there—we have hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and strong growth,” Singer tells CFO. Le Clair says going public likely will help DocuSign. While the company has made a good case to analysts that it’s not burning through much of its cash and is financially sound, he notes, the market won’t truly know where the company stands until an IPO. “Going public means their financials will be transparent, which would relieve any fears in those areas,” the analyst says. An IPO also would bring a cash infusion that could help DocuSign make acquisitions that would speed its transformation into a more well-rounded transaction management firm, according to Le Clair. Singer, for his part, envisions that growth will stem more from the efforts of the company’s engineering team. “We want primarily to be a builder rather than a buyer,” he says. Transaction management use cases, all driven by the same platform DocuSign uses to provide e-signature capabilities, already are expanding. Examples of moving away from paper-based processes, from DocuSign’s client base, include banks digitizing approvals for internal transactions and purchase orders; human-resources departments sending offer letters to job candidates; and sales departments more securely managing compensation programs. A big part of the push is adding workflow capabilities around payments. That’s not a new technological capability, but it fits well with DocuSign’s established business. “We’re not going to be a payments company per se, taking a piece of transactions,” says Singer. “But the first thing people tend to do after signing a contract is pay for what they just purchased. It’s a natural extension. So we’re helping companies leverage the top payment protocols to integrate payments on top of transactions.” In particular, there may be great opportunities for DocuSign in regulated industries—even though most regulations, other than some recently approved ones, require a physical paper trail to establish compliance. “It’s not that there’s an actual need for paper,” says Singer, “it’s just that regulations were written that way and people don’t want to take a regulatory risk. But one by one we’re seeing banks looking at this and saying it makes sense for their customers and for their business. There should be plenty of opportunity.” —D.M. Neo Technology WHAT’S THE CONNECTION? As with most tech companies, Neo Technology was founded when a technologist got frustrated. In this case, Emil Eifrem, Neo Technology’s CEO, was at a small startup in Sweden trying to build a content management system on top of a relational database. Specifically, Eifrem needed to represent a complex pricing model for stock photos. “We spent a majority of our time fighting against the relational database,” says Eifrem. “The shape of our data was a mismatch with its building blocks.” Many years later, Neo Technology is the creator of a leading open-source “graph” database, called Neo4j, that has been adopted in financial services, retail, government, and telecommunications. The product and its tools are used for real-time pricing, online product and service recommendations, fraud detection, and enterprise search. In November 2016, Neo Technology raised $36 million in a series D venture capital funding. According to Forrester Research, one-quarter of enterprises will be using graph databases by 2017. Gartner, on the other hand, predicts that over 70% of leading companies will pilot test a graph database by 2018. What is a graph, or graph-oriented, database? Essentially, it’s a database that uses graph theory to store, map, and query relationships. While traditional relational databases store data in rows and columns, graph databases plot data points and the connections between them as objects or nodes on a graph. “There’s a lot of data that fits into rows and columns,” Eifrem explains. “But with the advent of the Internet, and connected devices, data is not always that simple.” Graph databases enable organizations to understand the value of connections, influences, and relationships in data. A commonly cited application is a social networking company using a graph database to map out the connections of its users. But there are many other use cases, including online purchase recommendation engines for retailers and fraud detection for financial institutions. Supply chain analysis for some of the biggest food brands, by which they can trace a product back to the farm it originally came from, is another use case, says Eifrem. The most widely publicized use of Neo Technology’s product was the Panama Papers—the leaked confidential documents of a Panama-based law firm that revealed the secretive offshore companies used by the rich and powerful to hide wealth and evade taxes. Journalists used Neo4j to connect the dots in the 11.5 million documents and link individuals to offshore accounts. The Panama Papers raised awareness of graph databases, but so has the entrée of SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle into the space—all of them have announced graph database products. Those announcements were one of the reasons Neo Technology accepted $36 million in funding last year. “We have a three- to-five-year head start,” says Eifrem, “but they are big companies and can throw a lot of money at this.” Still, with 100 or more organizations using Neo4j in mission-critical systems, analysts see Neo Technology as the leader. Noel Yuhanna, a principal analyst at Forrester, says Neo’s product is different because it uses a native graph model—data is stored, processed, and accessed in graph format. Larger vendors’ offerings are not necessarily native. Being native, Neo’s product is faster and more secure. “And it can scale very well—customers are running billions of connections with Neo,” Yuhanna adds. It’s no surprise, then, that eBay, Cisco Systems, Novartis, Orange, Marriott International, and UBS are using Neo4j. As Neo Technology’s website notes, “Your data volume will definitely increase in the future, but what’s going to increase at an even faster clip is the connections (or relationships) between your data.” And, as Eifrem once found out, relational databases don’t handle relationships well. —V.R. 10 to Keep An Eye On These companies hope to be major disruptors in key enterprise information technology markets. 1. Zuora Category: Subscription management platform Pick your adjective for the subscription-based business model: booming, sizzling, skyrocketing, exploding. Zuora is in the heart of the action as a provider (a subscription-based one, of course) of billing and finance services for such businesses. The company has pocketed more than 800 customers, with potential new ones being formed every day. 2. Reckon Point Category: Indoor positioning Founded in 2015, Reckon Point uses WiFi and magnetic signals to create indoor maps that can track customers, assets, or employees within one meter of their exact location in real time. The system allows for a wide range of location-based services like enabling personalized ads to be displayed to customers moving within a space, or tracking patterns and trends in asset analytics that can optimize warehouse processes. 3. Atomiton Category: IoT computing It’s early days for Atomiton. But then, Microsoft started out small, too, on its way to becoming the dominant maker of personal computer operating systems. Atomiton’s “industrial Internet” software stack has already gained traction, with uses found in oil and gas, smart cities, and industrial automation. The company’s intelligent architecture could propel it to a leadership position in optimizing the performance of companies’ Internet-connected devices and products. 4. Rubrik Category: Data backup and recovery Data-backup and recovery technologies have weathered plenty of criticism for being either prohibitively expensive or difficult to use. Rubrik aims to counter that criticism with products that are neither. The company’s cloud data management platform delivers data protection, search, analytics, and compliance using a hybrid cloud setup. In February 2017, the two-year-old company reported a $100 million annual revenue run rate after just six quarters of selling. 5. Adyen Category: Online payment services Adyen, based in the Netherlands, is the Rosetta stone of online payments. It provides merchant online services for accepting electronic payments by credit or debit card, bank transfer, and other means. Its online platform connects to 250 different payment methods, from Visa to WeChatPay. In February, the company reported transaction volume of $90 billion in 2016, an 80% year-over-year increase. It services 7 of the 10 largest Internet companies. 6. Aviso Category: Sales forecasting and analytics Gone is the gut. CFOs impatient with sales forecasts based on intuition can now allay their anxieties via data science. Founded in 2012, Aviso aims to help clients “crush the quarter” by using predictive analytics to prioritize which targets to go after. The company has raised $31 million to date and its customers include Apttus, HubSpot, Nutanix, Pandora, and Splunk. 7. Agari Category: Email security Although the presidential election is over, politically motivated email crime still claims headlines. Agari, a cybersecurity firm that aims to block sophisticated phishing attacks, expects the prominence of government hacking to spur burgeoning attacks against companies. Its cloud-based Email Trust platform identifies the true sender of emails. The $24 million in funding Agari picked up in 2016 should provide ample fuel to address the opportunity. 8. Veem Category: Cross-border payments Small businesses represent $6 trillion of the $25 trillion market in cross-border payments. But they pay $50 billion in fees due to an antiquated wire transfer system that is cumbersome to use and provides little visibility into the status of transfers, according to Veem (formerly Align Commerce). The company’s multi-rail technology connects disparate parts of the international payments process, allowing SMBs to send and receive payments using only an email address. 9. Qlik Technologies Category: Business intelligence Qlik’s portfolio of cloud-based and on-premise solutions changes basic Excel data and other information into visualizations and analyses that can be shared by teams across many types of devices. The company says the intuitive design of its tools enables users of all technical skill levels to quickly and easily create, manage, and collaborate. Qlik has 40,000 customers worldwide. 10. Zoom Category: Videoconferencing Is Zoom the answer to web-conferencing woes? Its service unifies cloud video conferencing, online meetings, group messaging, and conference-room solutions. The platform, which does not require a complex video infrastructure, is used to hold webinars and host conference-room meetings on large HD displays, and provides a range of other conferencing capabilities. Zoom was founded in 2011 and is valued at $1 billion.

The startup, founded in 2012 by a group of former Googlers, will develop products for Volkswagen models and possibly other brands based on its voice-recognition and natural language processing technology. That includes a smart rear view mirror that provides navigation, messaging and information through voice input, the company said in a statement. Chinese tech giants are pushing into technologies that have the potential to transform the auto industry. Last month, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led an investment in WayRay, which makes holographic displays for cars. It’s also invested in Banma Technologies, a startup working with China’s SAIC Motor to develop internet systems for cars. And WeChat operator Tencent Holdings Ltd. has taken a 5 percent stake in Tesla Inc. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Alphabet Inc.’s Google led Mobvoi’s last round of financing in 2015, valuing the company at $300 million. That marked Google’s first direct investment in China since pulling its search service out of the country in 2010 because of disagreements with the government. Mobvoi’s other investors include prominent venture capital firms Sequoia and ZhenFund. Last year, Mobvoi became an official partner to Google’s Android Wear software, meaning its voice-search services are embedded in the U.S. company’s operating system for wearable devices. The startup has been making its own forays into the U.S.: it started selling its second-generation smartwatch device in the country last year. Mobvoi’s Ticwatch became a hit in China with its voice-activated search and features such as a touch-sensitive strip for scrolling. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Li Zhifei has said the company may consider a U.S. stock market listing if sales in the country match its success at home.

It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. johnforamerica Man, I swung back around because just upvoting you wasn't enough. Thanks for listening, considering, and acknowledging my points. I think I assumed that any additional responses would be intractable... thanks for proving me wrong. That's some good interneting brotha! Dennis Ulijn No problem. Normally people here reply to everything with "they should just make it a choice. Toggle it on or off". But not all problems are solved by giving people a toggle. What my initial response was: They should make it that photos in certain folders aren't backed up. Last week i made 20 pictures for work and don't want to keep them, but also don't want to completely delete them... Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time? Fruity101079 It took time yes, wait tomorrow, but i did it (I'm in France) and it's working (you can disable the vpn as soon as the option is ticked. towo Oh, great, it actually does work. Thanks. :) Jack Smith I need to be able to tag my pets Fruity101079 We still can't change the location of the picture (don't know why, some of them are completely wrong...) thespacecowboy This has been a feature for a long time. Go to Assistant, then Search, then it'll bring a long horizontal list of photos. Click on those, and it will bring all the people it 'knows'. Click on someone it doesn't know and name them, and it'll tag those people in all your photos so you can search them. therealbiglou Yes, we are all aware. This isn't the point of this article. Rita El Khoury That's not what this is. Re-read the post please. thespacecowboy But Rita.

Cecil Hardwood This only works for faces/people Google sees. I have lots of photos that for whatever reason Google has not identified any people in them or maybe 1 out of 3. It would be nice to be able to go back and add the ones Google missed. 4Ui812 You're a good looking lady Rita. It's a nice picture , you should use this one as your avatar. Peter Garlinski I'm assuming you're going to get at least a couple good bottles of beer for giving your friend publicity. Rita El Khoury Given how many times I've screenshotted stuff with him in it, I have to ask for at least one Pixel XL :p Vinayak Prabhu This is completely off topic. I noticed that you are using a S7 Edge.. How has it hold up after a year? Is there noticeably lag every now and then? m33d Rita's eyebrows be lookin' "on fleek!" Rita El Khoury Had to Google that. Thanks :) Kevin Chapple But, regrettably STILL not available in the UK.. ANY idea when this will be 'fixed' for the UK? jwildman16 Some others here stated that you can enable a VPN to a U.S. location, start adding names to faces, and then it will continue to do so after the VPN is disconnected. Matthew Merrick Doesn't matter. My Google Photos facial recognition wipes itself every 2 weeks for some godforsaken reason, rendering the service's most useful ability irrelevant, considering it rebuilds at not even one photo per day.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Google’s dedicated TensorFlow processor, or TPU, crushes Intel, Nvidia in inference workloads Google’s dedicated TensorFlow processor, or TPU, crushes Intel, Nvidia in inference workloads By Joel Hruska on April 6, 2017 at 9:48 am Comment Several years ago, Google began working on its own custom software for machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads, dubbed TensorFlow. Last year, the company announced that it had designed its own tensor processing unit (TPU), an ASIC designed for high throughput of low-precision arithmetic. Now, Google has released some performance data for their TPU and how it compares to Intel’s Haswell CPUs and Nvidia’s K80 (Kepler-based) data center dual GPU. Before we dive into the data we need to talk about the workloads Google is discussing. All of Google’s benchmarks measure inference performance as opposed to initial neural network training. Nvidia has a graphic that summarizes the differences between the two: Click to enlarge. Teaching a neural network what to recognize and how to recognize it is referred to as training, and these workloads are still typically run on CPUs or GPUs. Inference refers to the neural network’s ability to apply what it learned from training. Google makes it clear that it’s only interested in low-latency operations and that it’s imposed strict criteria for responsiveness on the benchmarks we’ll discuss below. Google’s TPU design, benchmarks The first part of Google’s paper discusses the various types of deep neural networks it deploys, the specific benchmarks it uses, and offers a diagram of the TPU’s physical layout, pictured below. The TPU is specifically designed for 8-bit integer workloads and prioritizes consistently low latency over raw throughput (both CPUs and GPUs tend to prioritize throughput over latency, particularly GPUs). Click to enlarge Google writes (PDF): “Rather than be tightly integrated with a CPU, to reduce the chances of delaying deployment, the TPU was designed to be a coprocessor on the PCIe I/O bus, allowing it to plug into existing servers just as a GPU does. Moreover, to simplify hardware design and debugging, the host server sends TPU instructions for it to execute rather than fetching them itself. Hence, the TPU is closer in spirit to an FPU (floating-point unit) coprocessor than it is to a GPU.” Click to enlarge Each TPU also has an off-chip 8GiB DRAM pool, which Google calls Weight Memory, while intermediate results are held in a 24MiB pool of on-chip memory (that’s the Unified Buffer in the diagram above). The TPU has a four-stage pipeline and executes CISC instructions, with some instructions taking thousands of clock cycles to execute as opposed to the typical RISC pipeline of one clock cycle per pipeline stage. The table below shows how the E5-2699v3 (Haswell), Nvidia K80, and TPU compare against each other in various metrics. Click to enlarge Before we hit the benchmark results, there are a few things we need to note. First, Turbo mode and GPU Boost were disabled for both the Haswell and Nvidia GPUs, not to artificially tilt the score in favor of the TPU, but because Google’s data centers prioritize dense hardware packing over raw performance. Higher turbo clock rates for the v3 Xeon are dependent on not using AVX, which Google’s neural networks all tend to use. As for Nvidia’s K80, the test server in question deployed four K80 cards with two GPUs per card, for a total of eight GPU cores. Packed that tightly, the only way to take advantage of the GPU’s boost clock without causing an overheat would have been to remove two of the K80 cards. Since the clock frequency increase isn’t nearly as potent as doubling the total number of GPUs in the server, Google leaves boost disabled on these server configurations. Google’s benchmark figures all use the roofline performance model. The advantage of this model is that it creates an intuitive image of overall performance. The flat roofline represents theoretical peak performance, while the various data points show real-world results. In this case, the Y-axis is integer operations per second, while the “Operational Intensity” X-axis corresponds to integer operations per byte of weights read (emphasis Google’s). The gap between an application’s observed performance and the curve directly above it shows how much additional performance might be gained if the benchmark was better optimized for the architecture in question, while data points on the slanted portion of the roofline indicate that the benchmark is running into memory bandwidth limitations. The slideshow below shows Google’s results in various benchmarks for its CPU, GPU, and TPU tests. As always, each slide can be clicked to open a larger image in a new window. Google’s TPU isn’t just a high performance engine; it offers substantially improved performance per watt as well, both in the original TPU and for improved variants Google has modeled (TPU’). Click to enlarge The chief limiting factor between Google’s TPU and higher performance is memory bandwidth. Google’s models show TPU performance improving 3x if memory bandwidth is increased 4x over current designs. No other set of enhancements, including clock rate improvements, larger accumulators, or a combination of multiple factors has much of an impact on performance. The last section of Google’s paper is dedicated to dispelling various fallacies and correcting misunderstandings, a number of which relate to the choice of the K80 GPU. One section is particularly worth quoting: Fallacy: CPU and GPU results would be comparable to the TPU if we used them more efficiently or compared to newer versions. We originally had 8-bit results for just one DNN on the CPU, due to the significant work to use AVX2 integer support efficiently. The benefit was ~3.5X. It was less confusing (and space) to present all CPU results in floating point, rather than having one exception, with its own roofline. If all DNNs had similar speedup, performance/Watt ratio would drop from 41-83X to 12-24X. The new 16-nm, 1.5GHz, 250W P40 datacenter GPU can perform 47 Tera 8-bit ops/sec, but was unavailable in early 2015, so isn’t contemporary with our three platforms. We also can’t know the fraction of P40 peak delivered within our rigid time bounds. If we compared newer chips, Section 7 shows that we could triple performance of the 28-nm, 0.7GHz, 40W TPU just by using the K80’s GDDR5 memory (at a cost of an additional 10W). This kind of announcement isn’t the sort of thing Nvidia is going to be happy to hear. To be clear, Google’s TPU results today are applicable to inference workloads, not the initial task of training the neural network — that’s still done on GPUs. But, with respect to Nvidia and AMD both, we’ve also seen this kind of cycle play out before. Once upon a time, CPUs were the unquestioned kings of cryptocurrency mining. Then, as difficulty rose, GPUs became dominant, thanks to vastly higher hash rates. In the long run, however, custom ASICs took over the market. Both AMD and Nvidia recently added (Nvidia) or announced (AMD) support for 8-bit operations to improve total GPU throughput in deep learning and AI workloads, but it will take significant improvements over and above these steps to address the advantage ASICs would possess if they start moving into these markets. That’s not to say we expect custom ASIC designs to own the market — Google and Microsoft may be able to afford to build their own custom hardware, but most customers won’t have the funds or expertise to take that on.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Orin Kerr By Orin Kerr April 6 at 11:00 AM President Trump recently signed a congressional resolution completing the repeal of broadband privacy rules announced by the Obama-era Federal Communications Commission. According to news reports, the purpose of the repeal was to allow broadband Internet service providers to conduct the same sort of monitoring of user online activities, such as Web-surfing habits, that companies like Google and Facebook can conduct. I don’t know much about communications law or the proposed regulations. But the description of what the repeal was designed to do made me wonder: Isn’t that kind of monitoring mostly illegal under the Wiretap Act? As I see it, the Wiretap Act substantially limits what kinds of surveillance broadband providers can conduct even without the Obama-era rules. Given that, it’s not clear to me how much the repeal actually matters. Conversely, if broadband providers wrongly think the repeal gives them a green light to monitor how users surf the Web, they may face some pretty significant class-action lawsuits they don’t currently expect. Depending on the details, those class-action suits may very possibly be meritorious — and if so, could carry statutory damages so high that the lawsuits could be “bet the company” litigation. This post will given an overview of that legal risk. I. Introduction to the Wiretap Act The Wiretap Act, for those who don’t know it, is a federal criminal and civil statute that prohibits intercepting contents of communications without the consent of a party to the communication. It started as a telephone privacy statute — it prohibited third-party wiretapping of a telephone call — but was expanded to the Internet in 1986. Today the Wiretap Act applies to pretty much every communications network and gives telephone and Internet users pretty strong privacy protections. Violating the Wiretap Act is a big deal. It is not only a federal felony but also triggers powerful civil remedies. Under 18 U.S.C. 2520, any person who has been unlawfully wiretapped can get civil damages from the violator that can include “statutory damages of whichever is the greater of $100 a day for each day of violation or $10,000,” or actual damages, if they are greater than that; includes “punitive damages in appropriate cases”; and includes “a reasonable attorney’s fee and other litigation costs reasonably incurred.” With statutory damages at $10,000 for each person wiretapped, a company that violates the Wiretap Act with respect to its customers on a large scale risks a super-high damage award. Next let’s go through the key elements of the statute to see why monitoring of Web-surfing might violate it. II. Interception of Contents Violating the Wiretap Act generally requires intercepting “contents” of communications. The leading case on the meaning of contents in the context of Web-surfing is In re Google Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation Litigation, 806 F.3d 125 (3d Cir. 2015), a case I blogged about at length when it was handed down. The basic idea is that URLs can contain contents under the Wiretap Act because whether information is contents depends on what the computer is doing with it. If a computer is merely passing on information that it doesn’t actually use, acting only as a conduit, the information passed on counts as contents with respect to that computer and collecting it collects contents under the Wiretap Act. The 3rd Circuit didn’t decide exactly where the content/non-content line was. But the court strongly hinted that, for a delivery service such as a broadband provider, the part of URLs that aren’t about the IP address needed to deliver the Web page counts as contents. See slip op. at 26. If that is right, then a broadband provider that collects the full URLs its users are requesting is obtaining the contents of its users’ communications. What can broadband providers do to avoid liability? They can limit the collection of Web-surfing information to what they need to gather to deliver the communication. That means the provider can collect IP addresses but generally can’t collect full URLs without triggering the Wiretap Act. (Interception also requires real-time acquisition, but I assume that’s how broadband providers would collect the information anyway, so I won’t dwell on that element.) III. Did a Party to the Communication Consent? The next big issue is consent. Interception is legal if a “party to the communication” — that is, the person who is surfing the Internet and having URLs collected — has consented to the acquisition. I’ve heard some people say that Terms of Service found in broadband contracts should suffice and avoid liability. But I don’t think this works, for two reasons. The first reason involves the consent standard, and the second reason involves who is a party to the communication. The first reason is that the standard for consent is very likely not met by Terms of Service. The relevant circuit caselaw on the consent standard was mostly handed down in the context of telephone calls, in part because there’s a suppression remedy for unlawful interception of telephone calls. (The suppression remedy gives defendants an incentive to litigate the issue and has led to a significant body of circuit court caselaw.) The circuit cases indicate that consent exists when a person has received clear notice of the monitoring and has elected to proceed anyway. The classic example is monitoring of prison phones, where there is clear written notice all over and right next to the phone indicating that the phone calls will be monitored. See, e.g, United States v. Amen, 831 F.2d 373, 378 (2d Cir. 1987). Importantly, however, the standard is consent in fact rather than constructive consent. The issue is whether the person did consent because he received notice and proceeded, rather than whether he should have known about the monitoring. Here’s how the First Circuit summarized the law in United States v. Lanoue, 571 F.3d 966 (1st Cir. 1995): Deficient notice will almost always defeat a claim of implied consent. See Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 282 (1st Cir.1993); Campiti, 611 F.2d at 390, 393. Keeping in mind that implied consent is not constructive consent but “ ‘consent in fact,’ ” consent might be implied in spite of deficient notice, but only in a rare case where the court can conclude with assurance “ ‘from surrounding circumstances … that the [party] knowingly agreed to the surveillance.’” Griggs–Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 116–17 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting Amen, 831 F.2d at 378) (emphasis supplied). We emphasize that “consent should not casually be inferred,” Griggs–Ryan, 904 F.2d at 117, particularly in a case of deficient notice. The surrounding circumstances must convincingly show that the party knew about and consented to the interception in spite of the lack of formal notice or deficient formal notice. Under that standard, a provision in a Terms of Service somewhere shouldn’t be enough to generate consent unless the particular user actually saw the notice of monitoring. Because most users don’t read Terms of Service — I certainly don’t — the fact that there is a term tucked away that a person theoretically should read (but no one actually does) shouldn’t be sufficient under the circuit caselaw to generate Wiretap Act consent. Clearer notice is required under the relevant circuit precedent, such as something that really gets in a user’s face and really puts them on notice. As far as I know, the broadband providers don’t have anything that clear and direct in mind. Granted, there is some precedent in some district courts suggesting a looser standard for consent. In particular, Judge Lucy Koh has handed down some decisions suggesting that clear Terms of Service governing scanning practices for an email account generate Wiretap Act consent. See, e.g., In re Google Inc., 2013 WL 5423918, at *14 (N.D. Cal. 2013); In re Yahoo Mail Litigation, 7 F.Supp.3d 1016 (N.D. Cal. 2014). In those cases, it was not contested that people read the Terms of Service when they set up an email account. The question was therefore whether the Terms of Service, when read, were clear enough to put users on notice of the monitoring. I don’t think Koh’s reasoning should give much comfort to broadband providers hoping to get Wiretap Act consent through Terms of Service, though. As I noted, most people don’t read Terms of Service. That reality may not have been pointed out (for reasons unclear) in the specific cases before Koh. But it’s the reality, and I think it’s reality that matters. Cf. Jandak v. Village of Brookfield, 520 F. Supp. 815, 820 n. 5 (N.D. Ill. 1981) (noting that Wiretap Act consent hinges on whether the party to the communication actually knew of the monitoring, not whether “the party reasonably should have known”). The second problem with a Terms-of-Service-as-consent theory is that the Wiretap Act gives statutory rights to parties to communications rather than to account holders. Let’s say you agree with Koh that Terms of Service are enough to generate consent for subscribers. Even if that’s right, that would be only enough to avoid liability for those people who signed up for the broadband accounts. It’s common for one person to set up the account and for everyone else in the family or house to use it. That means most people who use the service never consented to anything: They just hopped on the network and started to use it without knowing anything about the provider’s policies. Even assuming that most people read Terms of Service when they set up an account with a broadband provider, most people don’t read Terms of Service when they just hop on a wireless network with a broadband provider that someone else set up. It’s hard to see how such users consented. A reader not familiar with the Wiretap Act might think this is a little strange: Shouldn’t the rights go with the person who set up the account rather than the person who happens to use it? But the Wiretap Act’s answer is emphatically “no.” The whole structure of the Wiretap Act is that it’s the party to the communication — the person actually talking on the phone, or the person actually using the computer network — who has rights. And if you didn’t set up the account, and you just happened to hop on to a wireless hotspot and have no idea who the provider is or what its policies are, I don’t see how you consented to monitoring based on Terms of Service you never saw or (in some cases) couldn’t see even if you tried. IV. Possible Defenses That’s the basic case for liability if broadband providers try to collect beyond IP addresses. Are there possible defenses to liability? Yes, although I don’t see any as a clear winner. I’ll run through four possibilities below. The first defense might be to invoke arbitration clauses. From what I understand, broadband contracts include an arbitration clause. Does that mean account holders can’t sue in federal court? Maybe. But again, the Wiretap Act gives rights to parties to communications rather than to account holders. I don’t know much about arbitration clauses, but I would be surprised if you can be bound by an arbitration clause in a contract you never entered into. I would think that the people who use the monitored services but didn’t have the contract for the account can still sue (as could the websites visited, I suppose). A second defense might be to try to invoke the extension telephone exception, 18 U.S.C. § 2510(5)(a), which exempts from the definition of intercept “any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof … being used by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business[.]” Maybe what the broadband providers want to do is in the ordinary course of their business, and is therefore allowed? That argument is weak. The extension telephone exception is a telephone-specific exception to the statute that allows employers to listen in on employee calls. It doesn’t allow businesses to wiretap customers just because they do it broadly. See generally Briggs v. American Air Filter Co., 630 F.2d 414, 418 (5th Cir. 1980) (reviewing legislative history of Title III). A third defense would be to argue that the trial court should decline to award statutory damages. Several circuits have held that trial courts maintain the discretion not to award statutory damages under Title III. See, e.g., Nalley v. Nalley, 53 F.3d 649 (4th Cir. 1995); Dorris v. Absher, 179 F.3d 420 (6th Cir. 1999). Under these cases, statutory damages are all or nothing: The trial judge can either award each person illegally wiretapped the statutory $10,000 or else award them zero. Companies might argue that an award of $10,000 per person monitored would amount to such massive liability that trial judges should exercise their discretion and instead award damages of zero. This seems like a possible argument, but I gather it’s a claim made at the end of a case rather than the beginning. Given that, it’s not without considerable risk. A fourth defense is the trickiest. Under the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, which I explained in relevant part here, network providers can intercept communications “for a cybersecurity purpose.” A broadband provider might come up with the following scheme: First, create a program that intercepts full URLs and other contents for a cybersecurity purpose as permitted by the Cybersecurity Act of 2015. Then, after those contents are collected, disclose the communications for a different purpose such as to sell the data thanks to the repeal of the broadband rules. I would think the disclosure for a different purpose would be governed by the bar on disclosure under 18 U.S.C. 2702 of the Stored Communications Act as it relates to contents. The trick is that providers could argue under a range of various theories that perhaps the Section 2702 ban didn’t apply. The details of the arguments are complex, as they’re really about the ECS/RCS distinction that is the source of endless confusion to a lot of lawyers who study the Stored Communications Act. Given that this post is long enough, I won’t bother to go into the details. Suffice it to say that these are possible arguments but very technical ones and not at all obviously correct. And they would also hinge on the court accepting that the collecting the full URLs was really for a cybersecurity purpose and not for the purpose of collecting the information to use it for other reasons. The litigation risks would be considerable. V. Conclusion I have been told that the arguments above never entered the debate over the FCC regulations because communications lawyers just don’t think about the Wiretap Act. The Wiretap Act is a criminal statute in Title 18, and it’s just something off the radar screen of lawyers who practice communications law. If so, that should change. Depending on what the broadband providers want to do, the Wiretap Act may be a serious bar to the companies doing it legally. And given the hammer of statutory damages that the Wiretap Act allows, a mistake that implicates the Wiretap Act might end up as a very costly mistake. opinions volokh-conspiracy Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Google Home price, design specs, how it compares to Amazon Echo and where to buy – from Maplin and PC World to Argos Tech giant's gadget records your words and stores them within its mysterious data centres By Jasper Hamill 6th April 2017, 3:23 pm Updated: 6th April 2017, 3:52 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments AMAZON Echo better watch out, because there is a rival in town. Google has just released a smart speaker in the UK called Google Home, which lets users search for information or control music using their voice. Reuters 2 This innocent-looking gadget is called Google Home and is always listening out for its owner’s orders What is Google Home? Google is hoping we’ll all just get over our understandable fears about Big Brother-style surveillance and opt to buy its new Home device. The electronic device is a voice controlled speaker that connects to your WiFi network and lets you talk to the device as if it were a human. The tech titans insist there’s nothing creepy about installing microphones in ordinary people’s homes. Yet their reassurances are unlikely to win over people who find it difficult to entirely trust promises made by gigantic corporations with a vested interest in gathering as much data about their customers as possible. PA:Press Association 2 The electronic device is a voice controlled speaker that connects to your WiFi network We're in the Home stretch; Google Home is coming to the UK soon, stay tuned for more pic.twitter.com/P6uL0wqly9 — Google UK (@GoogleUK) February 28, 2017 How does Google Home work? The small cone-like device is a voice-controlled personal assistant that seeks to replace smartphones. All owners need to do is utter the words “OK Google” followed by an order of some kind. The answer to their query is then read out by a computerised voice. If you want Google Home to stop listening to you, you can press a microphone mute button. Google launches its voice-controlled Google Home to rival the Amazon Echo What is the price of Google Home? At around £129, Google Home is slightly cheaper than the similar Amazon Echo. Typically Amazon Echo devices sell for around £149.99. You can also purchase a base to go with your speaker, with £18 fabric bases and £36 metal bases allowing users to customise their device in a range of colours. In comparison, Amazon Echo just comes in two formats, black and white. New toy! #googlehome #google A post shared by James Waddington (@jwad86) on Apr 6, 2017 at 5:21am PDT Is Google Home like Amazon Echo? Google Home works a bit like Amazon's Echo in that it allows owners to perform small tasks using voice commands. However, Google Home is slightly different to its Amazon counterpart, because it allows users to ask follow up questions to their initial request. Another difference are the resources the devices use in their smart speakers. Google uses YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn, and iHeart Radio. Meanwhile Amazon Echo opts for Amazon Music, Prime Music, Spotify Premium, Pandora, TuneIn, iHeartRadio and Audible. Both Google and Amazon's gadgets take recordings of their owners' words and beam them back to back to base. When the devices are switched on, they are more or less always listening. It's Google Home UK launch day and thanks to the lovely people at @google I'll be testing this little fella in my connected home! #London #bemoreathome #ai #iot‬ #google #googlehome #tech #gagdet #gadgets #innovation #productdesign #product #design #connectedhome A post shared by Dean Johnson (@activrightbrain) on Apr 6, 2017 at 5:33am PDT Where can you buy Google Home?

The device will be released in the UK in June, the tech giant told the BBC.  Got a Google home for free when we upgraded our phones. Have no idea what I'm doing with this thing😕 #thanksbutwhy #soconfused #googlehome #isitworthit #help A post shared by Ashley Day (@ashleylynn_92) on Apr 5, 2017 at 11:23am PDT What can Google Home do? There are many different functions of Google Home. These include (among others): Music control Asking for weather forecasts Local area guides Calculator Alarm Calendar Dictionary Flight information Light control Traffic information Live sporting updates Lamguage translation TV control Here's what Google says about the privacy implications of its 'Home' gadget "Google Home listens in short (a few seconds) snippets for the hotword [which activates the device]. "Those snippets are deleted if the hotword is not detected, and none of that information leaves your device until the hotword is heard. "When Google Home detects that you've said "Ok Google," the LEDs on top of the device light up to tell you that recording is happening, Google Home records what you say, and sends that recording (including the few-second hotword recording) to Google in order to fulfill your request. "Google stores data about our conversations on its servers, which reside in its data centers. "We use data to make our services faster, smarter, and more useful to you, such as by providing better search results and timely traffic updates. "Data also helps protect you from malware, phishing, and other suspicious activity." Is Google Home safe? Of course, one thing Google's device won't understand is the feelings of people who don't want microphones inside their home. Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh told the BBC: "The trick... in these products is trying to really understand what people are asking for. "We've got so much history with people using our search products and people using voice queries through Android phones... that we're able to much better answer these types of questions. "All this data really helps in us making sure we understand what the user is looking for." Is it worth really trading your privacy for the ability to ask a computer to tell you the football scores?

While this may be true, you still need to eat, pay bills, and have a place to live. A lawsuit between Waymo and Uber has revealed what kind of income can be made by a talented (we presume) engineer who is experienced with autonomous cars. Apparently, Mr. Anthony Levandowski, a former employee of Google, collected over $120 million in incentive payments from the Mountain View giant, Automotive News reports. The detailed nature of those incentives is not mentioned, but do not dream of earning that much money as a junior engineer if you don't have a clue about this type of work. The figures came to public attention after the conglomerate’s autonomous car division, renamed Waymo, asked for arbitration against its former employee. Levandowski was accused of breaching his contract with the conglomerate after attempting to recruit people from its ranks for its rivals, while he was still working there. The current employer of Mr. Levandowski is Uber, which bought Otto, a company where the former Google employee had participation without mentioning it to his employers. The Otto company was not started from scratch, as it was renamed from Tyto, a start-up that Google once considered acquiring. Tyto Lidar LCC was investigated for purchase by Google, and Levandowski was a part of that process, in spite of the fact that he had participation in the firm. Moreover, he was also involved in another business, which is named Odin Wave LLC. This involvement was more than just owning stocks, as the former Google employee helped found both enterprises. All of the facts above were discovered in a lawsuit between Waymo and Uber, which was started after a supplier accidentally CC’d the former in reply to the latter. Until that response, the theft of intellectual property had not been discovered. Evidence that pointed to a tech theft were still in the company-issued laptop’s logs after one of the employees who stole proprietary designs copied it to an external drive. The defendant in the latest trial is one of those employees. autonomous cars Google Uber waymo self-driving cars self-driving vehicle autonomous   Has Ford Pulled a Prank on Everyone With the 2017 GT?

The report was based on an eye-tracking study conducted using the Sticky platform. As part of the study, 100 consumers were shown desktop Google search engine results pages (SERPs) for three hotel names (Capitol Hill Hotel, Park Lane Hotel, and The New Yorker Hotel). Participants' eye-movements were tracked as they looked at each SERP for 15 seconds. In past studies, consumers tended to look at desktop SERPs in an F pattern: starting at the top with paid ads, then moving down to organic results, then across to the ads in the right column. The rollout of new right column units by Google that display a hotel's business listing and metasearch price results has changed this behavior, the analysis found. Consumers now focus intently on the top of the page at the paid ads and hotel business listing. Organic results receive significantly less attention. The researchers found that when looking at hotel SERPs, consumers tend to look at the paid ads at the top first, the business listing second, and then either the organic results or metasearch prices. In addition to tracking eye movements, the researchers asked participants which links on the SERPs they would be most likely to click on. More than half (55%) said they would click on a paid link, 28% on an organic listing, 10% on a metasearch link, and 7% elsewhere (e.g., on the hotel photo in the business listing). About the research: The report was based on an eye-tracking study conducted using the Sticky platform. As part of the study, 100 consumers were shown Google search engine results pages (SERPs) for three hotel name keywords (Capitol Hill Hotel, Park Lane Hotel, and The New Yorker Hotel). Participants' eye-movements were tracked as they looked at each SERP for 15 seconds.

Create a note called Activities and you and your fellow planner can each add suggestions. Just click the collaborator icon on the note and enter your coworker’s email address in the pop-up box. They will receive an email with the title of the note and a link to open it in Google Keep. For that weekend retreat, you and several others may want to work on the itinerary or schedule together. Create your Schedule note and follow the same steps as above to share it. Then, any updates your collaborators make will appear automatically along with the time. Keep in mind that if you have more than one person helping, you can add several collaborators. Plus, you can use this sharing feature with several additional features below like annotations and lists. Mark Up Event Materials Google Keep has a handy annotation feature that can help you annotate photos, images, and documents to get the perfect result for your event. First, click the Add image button to upload your file and when you are ready to edit it. If you are planning a bridal shower for your best friend, getting the invitations and menu just right are important. Maybe you scanned a photo of the invitation or received an image of the menu from the caterer. Just click the image in the note and then select the Annotate Image icon from the top right. The image will then open in a small window with pen, marker, and highlighter tools. Perhaps you want to use a seating chart for the event you are planning like an engagement party for your daughter. You can use different colors to indicate seating for friends, each side of the family, and the head table. Using colors is also convenient if you are collaborating. You can assign each person a different color for their edits for easy organizing.

With the Google Keep checklist feature, you can stay on track and make sure that you do not forget a thing or even a person. For parties, picnics, reunions, and showers, you know that you need at least one list. Click the New list button in the new note box to begin. You can start with a guest list and use the checkbox feature in a variety of ways. Mark checkboxes as you prepare the invitations, to show those who have responded that they are attending, or to indicate those who cannot attend. No matter how you use the checkboxes, just be sure to take advantage of this handy feature. Next, you might create a to-do list for your event. Before the event, you may need to reserve a venue, order a cake, prepare the invitations, secure a caterer, and pick up the party supplies. Make a list of all tasks that need to take place before and even after the event. Another helpful list for your event is for supplies. Whether an indoor event like a baby shower or an outdoor celebration like a birthday party, you do not want to forget the supplies. And if you add a collaborator who will pick up items as well, you can mark off those you get as you purchase them. For successful event planning from start to finish, create and keep those lists handy. If you use Google Keep on your mobile device, this is perfect for marking off items on-the-go. Download — Google Keep for Android (Free) | iOS (Free) Take Advantage of Reminders You might need to call and confirm a venue reservation for a family reunion or mail graduation party invitations when you visit the post office next week.

Simply click the Remind me button and then Pick date & time. In addition to time-based reminders, you can use those that are location-based on your mobile device. Pop open the note you created for the invitations, click the Reminder button, Pick place, and begin typing a location.

Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, made this known in a statement in Lagos. The manager said that meningitis outbreak in Nigeria got many people using Google Search to find out more information about the disease. According to him, the one-week search ended on April 5. “The rise in the number of deaths and the Buhari Support Group Centre’s (BSGC) decision to embark on a sensitisation campaign across states affected by the outbreak got people searching for the disease online. “It has search phrases such as, `meningitis outbreak in Nigeria’, `cause of meningitis’, `meningitis outbreak’ and `how to prevent meningitis,’’ the manager said. Read: Emir of Kano blasts Gov. Yari, says statement on Meningitis were horrendous, Islamically incorrect According to Kola-Ogunlade, parents are advised to seek early medical help against diseases. “Mr Joshua Anav, Programmes Manager at the Ike Foundation for Autism on April 3, in Abuja, advised parents to seek medical assistance as early as possible. “This is to prevent full development of autism in toddlers, and as such, many Nigerians have gone onto Google to search for more information about autism. “Nigerians went to search for information using search terms such as `Fewa Otedola’, `meaning of autism’, and `Autistic child,’’ he said. He said that Nigerians also searched for information on Big Brother Nigeria and weekend sports. “Some Nigerians are more concerned about Big Brother Nigeria and the weekend sports, which included the Barcelona match against Granada, than autism or meningitis,’’ he said. He noted that Big Brother Nigeria’s Sunday night eviction show usually attracted a high number of viewers from reality television fans. The manager said that people who missed the live show went to Google to search for the YouTube video of the eviction show. He said that the search phrases included, “Big Brother Nigeria, 2017 eviction”, “Efe and Marvis”, “#bbnaija”, “Africa Magic, and “BBA Naija 2017”. Kola-Ogunlade said that in the world of sports, football lovers searched using terms such as “Granada vs Barcelona highlights”, “Barcelona Granada”, “Granada vs Barcelona” and “Arsenal vs Man City”. Kola-Ogunlade added that the arrest and detention of a U.S.-trained journalist, Kemi Olunloyo, also trended on Google after newspapers reported that Port Harcourt-based Pastor David Ibiyeomie laid charges against her over alleged defamation of character. “Popular faces such as Nollywood actress, Uche Nnanna, questioned the legitimacy of the case Ibiyeomie holds against Kemi. “Nnanna posted her reaction on Instagram, citing that a man of God should not have a journalist arrested for doing her job, if indeed the man is practising what he preaches, as this is something Jesus will not do,” he said. He also said that the hashtag #KeepTheChangeBae trended on the popular social network, Twitter, for over 24 hours. “It all started when Pablo Ayodeji, a young bachelor took a lady out on a date, hoping it would be a start to a relationship with young and beautiful Ore. “But when she said: “No, there will not be a second date or a relationship here”, Pablo took to Twitter to rant about a date gone wrong. “Ore, seeing Pablo’s rants on twitter, decided to payback N5,000 into Pablo’s account, which is N1,200 more to what he spent on the date, asking Pablo to keep the `change’. “Internet users used Google Search to query “keep the change bae”, “Pablo Escobar” and “Ibada”,’’ he said. Google Trends launched in May, 2006, allows one to see how popular search terms and their demography has been overtime on Google.

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares111 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Justin W This is an instant buy for me if it's true.

Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? Luxferro I've spent tons of $$$ on new routers throughout my years of being a computer geek. I tried Eeros for a month or so during their beta period, before I realized that I don't like dumbed down devices that you can't fully control. I'm anti-corporate-cloud based products. I have my own server and prefer my data be only on my server. After the Eero experience I gave Ubiquiti a try, and haven't looked back. Ordeith Ubiquiti is awesome. Google is crap. Luxferro You stalking me from the Chromebook thread? ;p Ordeith Are you using their EdgeRouter? How do you like it? Luxferro I have both, but switched from the edgeRouter to the UniFi router after buying more UniFi access points and UniFi switches. You manage all UniFi devices from one interface (the UniFi controller). Both are good, but the UniFi router is behind the edge in UI features. But pretty much anything lacking in the UI can be done via CLI. They update the UniFi router regularly, and have different branches so you can test new features, etc, if you want. But eventually the UI features will be on par with the edge. All the images I posted above are from the UniFi controller, which you can run in a VM, docker, or any PC on your network (windows, linux), or buy the dedicated CloudKey controller that can be powered by PoE. I really like it, and think it's awesome if you like to control everything and have oversight of your network. Also the developers actually interact with their customers via their forums (are not clueless customer support types), take feedback, help narrow down bugs, and are quick to patch in fixes. Ordeith I've used their access points in a number of projects, but not their routers. I have one site that has a need for ingress bandwidth control (rate limiting) on a per vlan basis. How is ubiquiti's stuff at handling configurations like that? Luxferro I haven't played with vlans or used any bandwidth limiting features. They do have vlan capabilities though, which are exposed in the controller UI. But not sure about the bandwidth limiting features. Ordeith Thanks. I'll research further. supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ? Why it's Google home version 3 which will be released 2 years after version 2. And Google wouldn't be Google if they didn't remove something from that was useful in the previous iteration. Version 3 will lack a voice assistant because ..... Hey it's Google. That's reason enough. bekifft I hope along with this they announce a major upgrade of the existing Home's Assistant functionality. Starting to feel like I wasted my money Nicholas Conrad Don't forget, Home has pogo pins under a sticker on the bottom. Portable battery powered Home with charging base also inbound. Maybe the charging base doubles as the wifi puck. #MakesTOOMuchSense Ordeith All your data are belong to us. -Google Mike I Just a note. This home Assistant is supposed to conjure up the image of a cup of latte.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel Emily Ferron April 6, 2017 A spec-by-spec comparison of Samsung's bezel free S8 flagship and the made-by-Google Pixel View gallery - 35 images In one corner, we have the Galaxy S8 – Samsung's latest premium flagship sporting a sophisticated build and impressive Infinity Display. In the other corner, we have the Google Pixel, with its Apple-like presentation and pure Android experience. How do the specs and features of these two top-shelf smartphones compare? Size Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information Overall, the Galaxy S8 is about 3-percent taller and narrower than the Google Pixel. The Galaxy S8 is also the thicker of the two. Weight The Galaxy S8 would mean about 8-percent more heft in your pocket or purse. For reference, the 12 g difference is about the weight of a triple-A battery. Build The Galaxy S8's entire back is glass. Its curved edges are rimmed with a minimal aluminum frame. The Google Pixel has an iPhone-like aluminum unibody with a glass panel on the upper back portion only. Colors The S8 comes in five colors, but only black, silver and orchid gray will be available in the US at launch. The Pixel comes in black, blue or silver. Water resistance The S8 series has an industry-leading IP68 water resistance rating. The Pixel is not similarly protected. Display size Despite being only a slightly taller phone, the Galaxy S8 packs in a significantly larger display. The 5.8-inch display covers nearly the entire front side of the phone, and offers about 19-percent more overall screen area than the Pixel. Display resolution The Galaxy S8 display, which has received resounding approval from one of the world's top independent analysts, also has higher resolution. It packs in about 23-percent more pixels per inch. Note that the larger Pixel XL – not included in this comparison – makes a more worthy resolution rival to the S8. Display type Both makers opt for AMOLED over IPS technology. HDR Another feather in Samsung's cap – the S8 series phones are the first to receive the Mobile HDR Premium designation, which certifies its support of HDR content. Curved display In the past, the smaller size of Samsung's Galaxy S-flagships have had standard flat displays. This year, both the S8 and S8+ have the curved displays previously reserved for Samsung's "Edge" products. Home button Both phones have onscreen home buttons. Samsung also introduced some pressure sensitivity into the onscreen home button, which could make for easier navigation shortcuts. (We'll explore this more in our full-length review.) Fingerprint sensor Both phones have back-mounted fingerprint sensors. The Pixel's fingerprint sensor is centered; on the S8, it is to the right of the camera. Face recognition Samsung added face recognition technology to the Galaxy S8. It is shaping up to be a fast, convenient way to unlock your phone, but it is reportedly easy to trick. Iris scanning Samsung also included a third type of biometric security: iris scanning. The method may be more secure than fingerprints or face recognition, but in our experience (so far) it is less easy to use and requires holding the phone at a specific angle. Processor In the US and a few other markets, Samsung uses the latest Snapdragon 835 chip. Elsewhere, it uses its own octa core Exynos 8895 chip instead. The Pixel, meanwhile, has a previous generation (but still capable) Snapdragon 821. RAM Both phones have 4 GB of RAM. Storage Samsung offers the S8 in only one 64 GB size. The Pixel is available with either 32 or 128 GB of built-in storage. MicroSD If 64 GB isn't enough for you, Samsung still has you covered with a microSD slot for expandable storage. No such luck with the Pixel. Headphone jack Don't worry – neither of these makers pulled an Apple. The headphone jack remains intact. Bundled headphones Samsung includes a pair of AKG earbuds that retail on their own for US$99. In most markets, the Pixel does not come with any headphones. Battery The two phones have very similar battery sizes, but there are many factors that go into overall battery life. By Google's estimate, the Pixel gets up to 13 hours of internet use, while Samsung claims up to 14 hours of internet use (over Wi-Fi). We'll do our own testing on the Galaxy S8 in our full-length review. Wireless charging Of these, only the S8 supports wireless charging (with a wireless charging pad, sold separately). It even supports fast wireless charging, if you splurge for a special Samsung-made charging pad. Fast charging Both phones offer (wired) quick charging capabilities. Camera megapixels This pair of phones has identical megapixel counts in the front and back cameras. Camera aperture (rear) Here, the Galaxy S8 camera has a larger aperture (the smaller the f-stop, the larger the aperture). That could pan out to mean perks like improved shooting in low-light conditions. Dual-lens camera To be clear, neither of these makers have opted for a dual-lens camera, one of the hot trends in recent smartphone flagships. Optical image stabilization (OIS) Samsung included optical image stabilization (OIS) for preventing photo blur caused by shaky hands. OIS is missing from the Pixel, though its multi-frame, algorithm-based approach to photography may make this requirement null and void. Mobile payments The S8's Samsung Pay mobile payment system has one advantage over Android Pay – it can mimic magnetic stripe cards, so it can be accepted at merchants without an NFC reader. Voice assistant The Pixel premiered Google Assistant, more or less the Android answer to Siri, which has since rolled out to all recent Android flagships. The S8 also includes Bixby, Samsung's new virtual assistant. The company envisions Bixby compatibility within its whole fleet of electronics and smart appliances in the future. There's a dedicated Bixby activation button on the side of the phone. VR headset The S8 supports the Samsung Gear VR mobile headset, while the Pixel is Google Daydream-ready. Both are capable, but the Gear VR's content library is much bigger and better. Desktop dock Samsung unveiled the DeX dock at its S8 launch event. DeX uses the S8 to power a desktop-like experience on a (sold separately) monitor, keyboard and mouse. Release The Galaxy S8 hits shelves later this month. The first made-by-Google phone was released last October. Software Both run Android Nougat, but Samsung skins it with its own TouchWiz UI. The Pixel provides a pure Android experience, and is first in line for software updates in the near future. Starting price (full retail) Prices for the S8 vary with carrier and payment plan, but you can count on spending about $720 or more when all is said and done. If you're thinking about scoring one, you may want to act fast – there are some pre-order specials available for early adopters. On the other hand, the Google Pixel starts at $649, the same price as an iPhone 7. Overall, these are two top-shelf Androids with rather different approaches, but some overlapping features. For the type of info that can't be found on a spec sheet, check out our review of the Google Pixel or our hands-on impressions of the Samsung Galaxy S8. Stay tuned – we will post full-length reviews of the newest Samsung flagships in due course.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Why All Your Gadgets Want You to Talk to Them Jake Swearingen Select AllApril 6, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Why all the electronic stuff in your life are suddenly so desperate to start up a conversation.More Unveiled last week, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 has many new features its top-of-the-line competitors don’t: bezel-free screen, Bluetooth 5.0, an OLED screen that looks better than 95 percent of TVs available on the market. But it also has something they all do: a voice assistant. Meet Bixby, Samsung’s new voice assistant (or, as they’re technically known, intelligent personal assistant). Previous Samsung phones used S Voice, a voice assistant that was little loved and annoying to use (and, indeed, was outclassed by Google itself toward the end of its life cycle). Bixby is Samsung’s attempt to start fresh. It will, ostensibly, one day let you do anything with voice you can do with touch (right now, that’s limited to ten or so Android apps and some basic phone functions). Bixby also has visual search, which lets you point your phone’s camera at something and get information about it, whether that’s where to buy a dress or information about the Flatiron Building; Bixby will also perform “passive” artificial intelligence, using what it knows about your schedule and location to provide information before you even ask for it. (Is traffic going to suck on the route to pick kids up from school? Bixby will let you know.) And you can use Bixby to control various smart objects in your home, whether that’s dimming the lights before movie night, or gradually waking the house up by turning on your coffee maker and your favorite radio station. But I wonder about Bixby. Google Assistant promised to be a game changer, but I’ve been using a Pixel XL for half a year now, and use it mainly to set timers and alarm clocks. I’ve used it occasionally to send texts (something I’d imagine I’d use a lot more if I drove on any regular basis), but for the most part, Google Assistant goes unused and unspoken to. Siri was a minor sensation when it first launched on phones — I eagerly upgraded my own iPhone in 2012 because I was moving to L.A., and figured being able to ask for directions or send a text on the go would be helpful while driving. But Siri was less than advertised, so text messages were hilariously garbled, and map directions (especially via the still-buggy Apple Maps) were often less helpful than just relying on the fact that the highways always sucked and side streets were the way to go anywhere, so Siri quickly became another voice assistant I just stopped talking to. But in the six years since voice assistants have hit the scene, from Siri to Bixby, they’ve stopped really being about your smartphone. (And, in the case of Amazon’s Echo, stopped being about your phone at all.) Oh, sure, they’re all still information devices — any of the options listed above will tell you what time the Cubs play the Cardinals today, or how the weather is going to look for today or tomorrow, or when the next showing of The Boss Baby will play at the local multiplex. But the sense I get talking to various people in industry is that the true promise for tech companies and voice assistants isn’t in being a walking, talking information directory. Instead, it’s about the industry’s strong belief that the smart home, despite slow adoption rates, is coming — and that the smart home is going to need a voice operating system, one that can understand and respond primarily via voice commands. Ask anyone who uses an Echo or Google Home on a regular basis — having to go back to pulling your phone out of your pocket just to check the weather can suddenly feel like a chore. Just writing out these examples makes me cringe with first-world privilege, but it’s true! I would much rather bug Alexa about playing WNYC in the morning, or finding out if the Mets won last night (they did not), than doing any of those things from my smartphone. Now imagine that same feeling, but for turning off your lights, or locking your doors, or closing the shades. Speech, now that voice recognition has hit a certain level of competence, is simply a more frictionless way to interact with your devices, particularly when you’re busy doing other things, like making dinner or taking care of kids. Samsung has made no secret that it wants to be at the center of the smart-home revolution. Unlike Google or Apple or Amazon, Samsung also produces refrigerators and washing machines and microwaves, and has been pushing the Samsung Smart Things Hub for years, a way to get your Samsung fridge and dishwasher and oven talking to each other and on the same page. It didn’t gain as much notice as the new Galaxy S8, but Samsung is quietly releasing its own set of mesh Wi-Fi routers to compete with things like Eero, Luma, and Google Wifi — and each will also work as a Samsung Smart Thing Hub. Samsung is also seemingly ready to really open up its ecosystem to third-party appliance makers, seeing how quickly Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s HomeKit have taken the world by storm. Read More There’s one final piece of the smart-home puzzle. When I talk to people who actually make devices for the smart home, most will quietly admit that the average consumer is not installing a smart lock on their front door, or ripping out and replacing their existing thermostat. When the smart-home revolution comes, it will be done by a few very techy DIYers, but mainly by home contractors who are increasingly being asked to either upgrade existing homes to include smart functionality, or are building new homes whole cloth with smart features built in. But to control all those Neato functions will mean you need something to talk to. The consumer choice, in other words, will not be between which smart-home-security system to install, but how they control that home-security system. And so Samsung’s Bixby, Apple’s Siri and HomeKit, Google’s Assistant and Home, and, of course, the Amazon Echo would all like to be that thing you talk to. It’s not a market that lends itself to fragmentation — I don’t want my washing machine using Bixby, but my home-security system running off Alexa — so all of these companies know that competition will be tight, and losers will be squeezed out. And the sooner you start feeling comfortable talking to your device, the better chance that company has at being the one that eventually welcomes you home each evening.

Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, made this known, in a statement, in Lagos. The manager said that meningitis outbreak in Nigeria got many people using Google Search to find out more information about the disease. According to him, the one-week search ended on April 5. “The rise in the number of deaths and the Buhari Support Group Centre’s (BSGC) decision to embark on a sensitisation campaign across states affected by the outbreak got people searching for the disease online. “It has search phrases such as, `meningitis outbreak in Nigeria’, `cause of meningitis’, `meningitis outbreak’ and `how to prevent meningitis,’’ the manager said. According to Kola-Ogunlade, parents are advised to seek early medical help against diseases. “Mr Joshua Anav, Programmes Manager at the Ike Foundation for Autism on April 3, in Abuja, advised parents to seek medical assistance as early as possible. “This is to prevent full development of autism in toddlers, and as such, many Nigerians have gone onto Google to search for more information about autism. “Nigerians went to search for information using search terms such as `Fewa Otedola’, `meaning of autism’, and `Autistic child,’’ he said. He said that Nigerians also searched for information on Big Brother Nigeria and weekend sports. “Some Nigerians are more concerned about Big Brother Nigeria and the weekend sports, which included the Barcelona match against Granada, than autism or meningitis,’’ he said. He noted that Big Brother Nigeria’s Sunday night eviction show usually attracted a high number of viewers from reality television fans. The manager said that people who missed the live show went to Google to search for the YouTube video of the eviction show. He said that the search phrases included, “Big Brother Nigeria, 2017 eviction”, “Efe and Marvis”, “#bbnaija”, “Africa Magic, and “BBA Naija 2017”. Kola-Ogunlade said that in the world of sports, football lovers searched using terms such as “Granada vs Barcelona highlights”, “Barcelona Granada”, “Granada vs Barcelona” and “Arsenal vs Man City”. Kola-Ogunlade added that the arrest and detention of a U.S.-trained journalist, Kemi Olunloyo, also trended on Google after newspapers reported that Port Harcourt-based Pastor David Ibiyeomie laid charges against her over alleged defamation of character. “Popular faces such as Nollywood actress, Uche Nnanna, questioned the legitimacy of the case Ibiyeomie holds against Kemi. “Nnanna posted her reaction on Instagram, citing that a man of God should not have a journalist arrested for doing her job, if indeed the man is practising what he preaches, as this is something Jesus will not do,” he said. He also said that the hashtag #KeepTheChangeBae trended on the popular social network, Twitter, for over 24 hours. “It all started when Pablo Ayodeji, a young bachelor took a lady out on a date, hoping it would be a start to a relationship with young and beautiful Ore. “But when she said: “No, there will not be a second date or a relationship here”, Pablo took to Twitter to rant about a date gone wrong. “Ore, seeing Pablo’s rants on twitter, decided to payback N5,000 into Pablo’s account, which is N1,200 more to what he spent on the date, asking Pablo to keep the `change’. “Internet users used Google Search to query “keep the change bae”, “Pablo Escobar” and “Ibada”,’’ he said. Google Trends launched in May, 2006, allows one to see how popular search terms and their demography has been overtime on Google. (NAN) Share How I cure baldness using these natural techniques.

Author: Emma Grey Ellis. Emma Grey Ellis Culture Date of Publication: 04.06.17. 04.06.17 Time of Publication: 10:00 am. 10:00 am Facebook’s New Plan May Curb Revenge Porn, But Won’t Kill It Getty Images Facebook needed to move against nonconsensual porn. The scandal surrounding Marines United, a secret Facebook group of 30,000 servicemen who shared dozens of women’s private images without permission, proved that. Now, the social media giant finally shuffling in the right direction. On Wednesday, Facebook released new guidelines for how it plans to curb the sharing of nonconsensual porn, which some call “revenge porn,” whether revenge was the motive or not. Under Facebook’s new bylaws, if revenge porn pops up in your newsfeed and you report it, a team of (unfortunate) Facebook employees will now vet the image, and implement photo-matching technology to make sure it doesn’t spread any further. The protocol works across Facebook Messenger and Instagram, too. But while this policy is a great start—and will give Facebook some much-needed legal cover if federal law ever criminalizes nonconsensual porn—the only way to kill revenge porn is to stop it being posted in the first place. Related Stories Emma Grey Ellis It’s Time for Facebook to Deal With the Grimy History of Revenge Porn Sarah Jeong Revenge Porn Is Bad. Criminalizing It Is Worse Brian Barrett Twitter Finally Banned Revenge Porn. Now How to Enforce It? Facebook’s photo-matching technology should be a huge boon to revenge porn victims. “The constant challenge for the victim is reporting each post that shares their photo,” says Mary Anne Franks, who teaches First Amendment and technology law at the University of Miami Law School, and also serves as the tech and legislative policy advisor for the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative. “So we’re really excited about this. It will alleviate some of that burden.” Once someone reports an image, Facebook can be reasonably confident photo-matching technology will catch the rest. (Even better, a pop-up will notify the would-be poster that the photo they’re about to share is revenge porn.) It’s basically the same hashing technology that powers Google’s image search, and Facebook already uses something similar to help identify child pornography. Circumventing it is difficult: a person would need to making significant visual changes to the original image, like adding stickers or filters or pasting the person onto a new background to bamboozle the tech. “If it’s just some dude uploading a photo from his phone, this should work really well,” says Jen Golbeck, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland. Legally speaking, it’s a good move for Facebook too. If sharing revenge pornography becomes a federal crime—which Franks and congressional representative Jackie Speier (D-California) are working on—Facebook is going to need to find some shelter. As with criminalized content like child porn or terrorist videos, online intermediaries like Facebook would be legally obligated to report revenge porn to the powers that be, retain evidence, and take good faith measures to stop its spread. The photo-matching technology would help the company do that. “This is one of the ways Facebook could signal they are trying to address this problem in the same way as child pornography,” Franks says. The key word there, though, is “trying.” Like child porn or doxxing, revenge porn inflicts damage the first time it’s shared, so removing something after it’s already been posted is a second-best solution. And this measure wouldn’t even catch the nonconsensual porn shared within a closed ecosystem like the Marines United group. “We have to work preemptively. We’ve got a real problem with people sharing these images in a likeminded group,” Franks says. “In that situation, a woman might not find out her photos had been shared for 8 or 9 months.” Or ever. Nor does reporting nonconsensual porn on Facebook stop the image from spreading elsewhere the internet. When one Marines United member reported that group for its behavior, other members just moved the revenge porn party over to Google Drive. Franks expects other major tech platforms like Google and Twitter to announce similar policies soon, but it will take those systems being interoperable—or at least communicating with each other—to make a dent in this issue. The only thing that could really stop a group like Marines United is an AI that scans images prior to posting. According to a Facebook spokesperson familiar with the efforts, the company is heading in that direction, and the only thing holding it back is coaching the AI to understand context—the thing that makes a photo revenge porn instead of, say, the “napalm girl” or a work of modern art. “Even if it’s right 90 percent of the time, you really don’t want to catch stuff that’s legitimate,” Golbeck says. “It’s probably going to take more fine tuning to avoid those user concerns.” The question of context also brings up another user concern: censorship creep. In the past, groups like the ACLU have opposed revenge porn laws not because they condone the behavior, but because the overly broad laws would have also criminalized consensual porn, or even photos of Holocaust victims. And if every major social media platform takes down the same harmless image at the same time, it could be a public-relations disaster. To avoid those fiascos, the path forward requires both cooperation and codification. “With mushy categories like ‘extremism,’ you run the risk of censoring political speech or dissent,” says Danielle Citron, who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “But if the definition of nonconsensual porn is narrow enough, we could have a shared industry database that avoids the pitfalls.” Beyond agreeing to a specific definition of revenge porn, Citron says, companies need to educate their content moderators about the possibility of unintentional censorship, so that missteps don’t happen. Facebook has created a template for others to expand and iterate on. That’s a great first step. Now comes the rest of the journey. And finding consensus on limiting internet speech in Silicon Valley? That might be even harder than hunting down revenge porn. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Facebook Social Media Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Now, as a part of the company's focused approach to Google Play Games Services (GPGS), it has announced that support for iOS has ended, and that features are being cut on Android too. Google claims that even though GPGS allows developers to build feature-packed games, and enables them to analyze and optimize them accordingly, usage on iOS has been relatively low. As a result, moving forward, the latest release of Native SDK - which is version 2.3 - will not support integration with iOS. Similarly, the company won't be updating or supporting the iOS SDK anymore as well. Additionally, Google has also said that it is removing features from GPGS on Android based on developer feedback, in order to make it "more useful". Support for Gifts, Requests, and Quests will be dropped, and the company says that developers have the next 12 months - until March 31, 2018 - to prepare for the removal of these features. Meanwhile, Sign-in, Achievements, Leaderboards and Multiplayer will continue to be supported on Android for the foreseeable future. Google claims that GPGS still remains an "important part" of the tools it provides to developers, and that it is working hard on future updates for the services.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Google may combine Home and Wi-Fi hub into a… Google may combine Home and Wi-Fi hub into a single product By Jon Martindale — April 6, 2017 6:40 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you In the future, Google Home products could have multiple abilities, cutting back on physical space and power plug requirements. Google has big plans for its connected home hardware, but its strategy has been two-pronged as of late, involving both Google Home and its Wi-Fi router. That may not be the case in the future, however, as it is purportedly looking to combine both of these into a single connected smart hub. Such a combination would make for a Wi-Fi router with a smart, connected speaker that understands vocal commands. It would not only make it easier for Google to market its smart-home devices to customers with a singular product, but could help lead to the future it envisions, where customers have more than one such device in their home. While we don’t have any hard announcement from Google detailing such a product, The Information (via Ars) cites a report that Google will make such a move to help it compete directly with Amazon’s burgeoning Alexa home hardware like the Echo and Echo Dot. More: OK, Google: What can Home do? The speaker’s most useful skills Currently Google Home and Google Wi-Fi are priced at $130 each, so presumably, any combination of the two would cost a little more than either of them alone, but would be cheaper than the cost of buying both. Although Google Home and Google Wi-Fi have proven to be popular products, despite increasing competition from other big name manufacturers, Google has had to contend with some adversity in recent months. With the launch of the Beauty and the Beast movie, a suspected ad appeared during one user’s daily update from their Google Home. While Google denied it, the user base was not happy with the idea. Google will, however, need to find some way to monetize vocal assistants in the coming years if more and more people do their searching through platforms like Google Home, rather than through the traditional Google search engine.
Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Play Games trims out unneeded elements, streamlines services By John Hoff - April 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is streamlining Google Play Games to make it more efficient and relevant for game developers out there. With that, it will be trimming from its long list of services – things like support for iOS account creation, and elements of Google Play Games like Gifts, Requests, and Quests. These elements will start getting phased out soon. Google will be ending features in Google Play Games that have very low usage – in particular, the Gifts, Requests, and Quests features. The reason behind the decision is really usage. Google says that most other developer tools within Google Play Games are getting good use, but these elements do not. In December, Google also announced that it was officially ending support for the creation of new iOS accounts. This is because there is very low usage of Google Play Games on iOS, naturally. In addition to ending support, Google Play Games’s newest SDK release will no longer support integration with iOS, from today moving forward. To facilitate the ending of these said elements – especially Gifts, Requests, and Quests – Google is giving time to app developers who do use these tools, leaving the tools open for 12 more months. The tools will be phased out by March 31, 2018.

Firm unleashes voice-activated gadget that's been compared to a Big Brother-style listening device by Jasper Hamill and Martyn Landi 6th April 2017, 2:17 pm Updated: 6th April 2017, 2:25 pm Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments GOOGLE has launched a voice-activated assistant called Home in the UK. The device is a rival to Amaron’s Echo and uses Google Search as well as Maps and Translate to help you get your life in order. Reuters 5 Google Home is already available in the US and will hit UK shelves next month PA:Press Association 5 The lights on top of Google Home pulse to show whether it’s listening or performing tasks It was launched today (April 6) and costs £129. The gadget works a bit like Amazon’s Echo and lets you set alarms, organise you calendar and choose music using your voice. All owners need to do is say the words “OK Google” followed by an order. Google Home’s Suveer Kothari said: “With your permission, Google Home can assist you in planning your day, based on information like your calendar entries or flight information from your Google account. “But if you’d rather keep things to yourself, you can turn off personal results any time in the Google Home app with a single swipe.” PA:Press Association 5 Google Home will compete with Amazon’s Echo device, which has proved to be wildly popular AP:Associated Press 5 The Google Pixel phone displayed next to a Google Home smart speaker The minute you utter the trigger words “OK Google”, your voice is being recorded and stored at Google’s HQ. When the devices are switched on, they are more or less always listening out for owners’ orders. Speech is recorded locally, but is only sent back to Google when owners utter the words “OK Google”. The tech titans insist there’s nothing creepy about installing microphones in ordinary people’s homes. Yet their reassurances are unlikely to win over people who find it difficult to entirely trust promises made by gigantic corporations with a vested interest in gathering as much data about their customers as possible. Artificially intelligent voice assistants have become increasingly popular products among technology firms, with Samsung announcing its own take on the subject, Bixby, last week to rival Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s Siri. Google Home owners will also be able to use the device to control other smart home products, including light bulbs and thermostats, as well as TVs and other speakers connected using Google’s Chromecast devices.

The tech giant also announced it was launching its Wifi router – Google Wifi – in the UK. The device, which will also cost £129, uses technology called mesh Wifi, which Google says uses multiple routers to evenly spread internet signal throughout the home. Voice-activated computers are likely to become commonplace in the coming months and years – but some experts fear they could end up being sexually harassed. We pay for your stories!

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. As a realtor, you deal with the local market. Local searches are exploding. Almost a third of mobile searches have local intent. Here are some tips to get the most out of your paid local search budget. Location Targeting This is the crux of local search. Google allows you to target by location. If you live in Los Angeles, you don’t want people in Cleveland to see your real estate ads. Every time they click, you’re wasting money. Timing Is Everything Google allows you to show ads during certain days of the week. You can also show your ads during certain hours of the day. This all comes back to your data. If your weekend leads are less profitable, increase your weekday spend. If nighttime clicks don’t convert well, then shut off your campaign during nighttime hours. Complete Your Profile If your ads don’t show up, you’re out of the game. And the person with the highest bid doesn’t necessarily show up. Your quality score directly impacts Google’s calculation. Google wants to show consumers ads that are relevant. Your quality score is dependent on many factors. For instance, the design of your landing page and your copy is essential. Likewise, your account history and your closeness to the searcher matter too. Yet, there are other ways to boost up your quality score. Many listings are not 100% complete. They are only partially completed, a situation that Google that doesn’t look on with favor. Also, there are other issues too. For instance, Google is more likely to show your ads when your business is open for operation. In other words, you can get a higher quality score when your business is open. Since Google allows you to run ads when you want to, consider concentrating your ads when your business is open. Reviews Help Conversions 84% of Americans say that reviews influence their purchasing decisions. Getting someone on your page isn’t enough. You want them to take the next step, to request more info, to schedule a viewing of the house, to call you on the telephone. Reviews turn clicks into conversions. How can you get reviews? It’s definitely a tricky situation. Only 28% of Americans have written a review. Moreover, many of those people had a negative experience, not a positive one. Here are some things you can do to improve your lot. Address Positive Reviewers– A lot of businesses are quick to reply to a negative review. That’s not a bad thing. You need to defend yourself in the digital world. There are two sides to every story, and customers should hear your side. That being said, positive reviewers often hear crickets. This shouldn’t be. If someone leaves you a glowing review, you should thank them. Also, considering leaving them a positive review, telling others they were a pleasure to work with. This is a natural way to respond to reviews if you’re not quite sure what to say back. Solicit Reviews In Your Workflow– The squeaky wheel gets the grease. This is true in life, and with reviews as well. At the very least, you should ask for a review at the end of the job. Yet, you can do more than that. You can give someone a card, leaving a request for a review. You can offer a discount for a review. Additionally, you could leave a Yelp sticker. Solicit reviews from satisfied customers, and you’ll do well. Push Through Good Reviews– Yelp has a strict review filter. They do whatever they can to weed out fake and paid reviews. Occasionally, honest reviews are collateral damage. This usually happens to accounts that are new or untested. Reviewers can push past Yelp filters by adding a picture, syncing their account with Facebook, or becoming a more active contributor on Yelp. If you have positive reviews that are hidden, let the account holder know these tips. This gives their review a better chance of being seen. The Future of Local Searches Local searches are getting bigger. Glide past other realtors now. Get the most out your paid local searches by following the tips above.

I am addicted to Google more than anything as I use it the most," Kritika said in a statement. "I even Google words in foreign languages to get the pronunciation right. If I watch a movie, then I Google about it for more knowledge such as the making, about people in the movie, what has he or she done before, etc. Google is my best friend," she added. "Prem Ya Paheli Chandrakanta", aired on Life OK, also features Ankit Arora, Gaurav Khanna and Sudesh Berry. -*- Keith Sequeira 'shocked' by snake on set Actor Keith Sequeira got shocked when he saw a snake while shooting for an upcoming show in Karjat. The show, touted to be a 'royal love story', will feature Keith as Maharaja Madhav Singh, a Rajasthani prince who is righteous and down-to-earth. Keith saw the snake while coming out of his room. "At first, I was shocked to see a snake on the wall. Later, it went away on its own so I was all okay. I was so surprised that I ended up taking a video and posted it on my social media account too," Keith said in a statement. Besides Keith, the Star Plus show will also feature actress Sanjeeda Sheikh, who will play a successful movie star. --IANS sas/rb/bg (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Samsung is going so all in on this assistant that it added a dedicated button for it on the side. However, since this is Android, some people would prefer to use Google Assistant/Now for this button. Now, thanks to a clever developer, that is possible… The best gifts for Android users Looking back for just a second, we already know that Google Assistant will, in fact, work with the Galaxy S8 via a long-press of the home button, just like every other Android device. The dedicated AI button on the side of the phone, though, is certainly more convenient. Thankfully, the app “All In one Gestures” can enable Galaxy S8 users to remap that button to basically anything, including Google Assistant. The process is pretty simple, as XDA details. The app will request a few permissions, then you can start mapping buttons. You can do this with the volume buttons and power button as well, but to get things going with the Bixby button, you’ll need to access the options menu and select custom keys. Then, enter in the code 1082, as that is the button code for that button, and then you’ll be able to map that to anything. If you want this to launch Google Assistant, select Search and then Voice Search. Due to the way this is set up I don’t think Samsung will disable it immediately, but it feels like the company will try to do so at some point or another. Hopefully, though, we’ll still be able to use this once the phone launches later this month.

Google on Thursday launched its internet-connected smart speaker in the UK, giving us another way to control our music and search for information by shouting out commands. Like Echo, Google Home connects to your WiFi network and can be controlled via an app on your smartphone. But what both these companies are trying to persuade you to do is put your phone down, switch off your screens, and speak to these devices as if they were real people. It’s not something that comes naturally. After years of typing queries into search engines, we have become conditioned to interact with technology in a certain way. It doesn’t help that you have to say “Hey Google” - or, in the case of Amazon Echo, “Alexa” - every time you want to get your smart speaker’s attention. Google Home But if you need any convincing that this is how we will communicate with technology in the future, just give one to a young child. In the same way that most kids intuitively understood how to use the iPad’s touchscreen when it was first released, speaking to an artificially intelligent voice assistant just seems to come naturally to them. Of course, these companies’ sudden interest in developing smart speakers isn’t really about changing the way we use technology. For them, the endgame is about becoming the nerve centre for the smart home. Right now, that means dimming the lights, turning up the temperature and queueing up Netflix on your smart TV with a few voice commands. But soon we’ll be able to control everything from our washing machines to our front door locks in this way. Read More Your Amazon Fire TV Stick is about to get a BIG upgrade Philips lets you control your lighting from an app (Photo: Philips) We will also become increasingly reliant on these digital assistants to organise our lives - from planning our daily schedules to booking holidays and ordering our weekly groceries. With the prospect of large amounts of money - and more importantly, personal data - being processed in this way, it’s perhaps no surprise that Google and Amazon are vying for dominance of the smart speaker market. Amazon has already gone a step further, and started integrating its Alexa software into web-connected appliances such as TVs, fridges, and even cars. While the idea of reducing the amount of time we spend staring at screens is undoubtedly appealing, it’s impossible to ignore the elephant in the room - that we are essentially bugging our own houses. Read More Google Home review: An excellent gadget for the modern house Amazon Echo Both Amazon and Google strongly object to the notion that their smart speakers are “always listening” but, to an extent, they have to be, in order to respond to your every whim. The official line from both companies is that, while in standby mode, the speakers are only listening for their “wake words”. It is only after they have been “woken” that Google or Amazon starts recording and processing what is said. That may help to reassure some, but it doesn’t take away from the fact that the data collected by these devices can be very revealing. Last year, detectives in the US seized an Amazon Echo speaker as part of a murder enquiry, claiming that if it had been activated - either deliberately or by mistake - on the night the crime was committed, it could give vital insight into what happened. Read More Google's answer to the Amazon Echo smart speaker finally gets UK release date Nest security camera Forensics experts have also claimed that “smart home” devices such as security cameras, motion sensors and even web-connected kitchen appliances could make up the "crime scene of tomorrow". The old adage is that if you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear. And, for the most part, that’s probably true. But with analysts at Ovum predicting that worldwide sales of smart speakers will grow from 5.5 million in 2016 to more than 88 million in 2021, it’s important to keep an eye on the bigger picture.

We have moved beyond seeing voice search as a futuristic concept with rather limited and stilted realization, to viewing it as an increasingly integral part of our interactions with home and handheld devices. However, voice search brings with it a lengthy list of questions for technology providers, consumers, and marketers alike. If we are indeed at something of a crossroads for this technology, it seems a good time to address these questions, giving particular thought to how the landscape will change over the next few years. These questions include, but are certainly not limited to: What types of queries are best suited to voice search? What do people use voice search for? How will voice search be monetized? How will voice search performance be tracked? Is voice search really the end-game for Google, Amazon, et al? Or is it rather a means to an end? Unfortunately, neither Siri, Alexa, nor Google Now were of much assistance when I posed them these questions, so we will endeavor to answer them the old-fashioned way. Let’s start with a quick recap of where we are today. Voice search: Some background Voice search allows users to speak directly to a search engine via their mobile or desktop device. The search engine then looks for data that responds to the user’s query based on the voice command. Voice search providers understand a user’s intent not just through what question is being asked, but also through geo-information, browsing history and past behavior, with the goal of instantly answering that query. At its apotheosis, this technology should be able to alert us of – and resolve – queries and issues before we even become consciously aware of them. Push notifications from Google Now on Android devices provide a glimpse of just how effective this could be. Voice search has actually been around for well over a decade, but until recently it has been subordinate to its text-based counterpart, hindered by hilarious but damaging bloopers. Verbal communication, of course, predates written language and, as such, it feels more natural for us to hold a spoken conversation. However, when it comes to searching for and retrieving information online, we have experienced this development in reverse, starting with written language and progressing to verbal communication. As a result, marketers have often been left with the unenviable task of inferring user intent from the simple phrases typed into search engines. This has come with benefits, too. One of the real defining elements of search marketing has always been the predictability of search queries and volumes. We set budgets aside based on these numbers, we forecast performance taking these numbers as facts, so it will affect us if search trends are imbued with the inherent fluidity and transience of speech patterns. That said, it has taken the collective might of Google, Amazon, Baidu, Microsoft and Facebook to get us to a point where voice search is now a viable (and sometimes preferable) way of requesting information, and there is still some way to go before the technology is perfected. There are many reasons for this staggered roadmap. First of all, the task of taking meaningful spoken units (morphemes) from a person, converting them to text units (graphemes) on a computer, and finding the corresponding information to answer the original query, is an incredibly complex one. As such, the list of possible voice commands for a search engine still looks something like this: We shouldn’t expect such formulaic constructions to remain as the standard, however. Industry developments like Google’s Hummingbird algorithm have moved us closer to true conversational search than we have ever been before. Voice search therefore seems, logically, to be the area that will develop in tandem with advances in conversational search. And for us search marketers, developments like the addition of voice queries within Search Analytics mean we can soon report with at least a modicum of accuracy on our campaigns. So, as natural language processing improves, the anthropomorphic monikers given to digital assistants like Alexa and Siri will make a lot more sense. They will engage us in conversation, even ask us questions, and understand the true intent behind our phrases. We are already seeing this with Google Assistant. This technology has the ability to ask questions to the user to better understand their intent and perform actions as a result, for example to book train tickets. This is a fascinating and impressive development that has implications far beyond just search marketing. When combined with Google’s integration of apps into its search index, we can gain a clearer view into just how significant voice search could be in shaping user behavior. It also moves us a few steps closer to query-less search, where a device knows what we want before we even think to ask the question. It must be said, nonetheless, that Google is far from monopolizing this territory – Amazon, Apple, Baidu and Microsoft are all investing heavily and there is an ongoing land-grab for what will be very fertile territory. Why is voice search so important? We know that voice recognition, natural language processing, and voice search are of strategic importance to the world’s biggest tech companies, and a recent quote from Google reveals exactly why: “Our goal in Speech Technology Research is twofold: to make speaking to devices around you (home, in car), devices you wear (watch), devices with you (phone, tablet) ubiquitous and seamless.” To be both ubiquitous and seamless means being driven by a unified software solution. Digital assistants, powered majoritively by the technology that underpins voice search, can be the software that joins the dots between all of those hardware touchpoints, from home to car to work. As Jason Tabeling wrote last week, this is a growing hardware market and the onus is on securing as much of this market as possible. Amazon and Google won’t always want to invest so heavily in the hardware business, however. It would be far more sustainable to have other hardware makers incorporate Amazon and Google’s software into their devices, increasing the reach of their respective virtual assistants much more cost-effectively. For now, winning the hardware race is a sensible Trojan horse strategy to ensure that either Google or Amazon gains a foothold in that essential software market. Who is using voice search? Predominantly younger generations, although this trend is even more deeply entrenched in China than in the West, due to the complexity of typing Chinese phrases and a willingness to engage with new technologies. As such, Baidu has seen significant growth in the usage of its voice search platform. Google voice search and Google Assistant are increasing their recognition accuracy levels significantly, however, which has previously been one of the important barriers to widespread uptake. In fact, the difference between 95% and 99% accuracy is where use goes from occasional to frequent. These margins may seem relatively inconsequential, but when it comes to speech they are the difference between natural language and very stilted communication. It is this 4-point increase in accuracy that has seen voice search go from gimmick to everyday staple for so many users. Certain types of queries and searches are likely to require more than just one instant answer, as they require a visual element; for example, planning a trip, or deciding which winter coat to buy. It is imperative that businesses do not over-optimize for voice search without thinking this through, as voice search does not yet lend itself so readily to these more complex answers. The graph below shows the different ways in which teens and adults have reported using voice search: This generational gap is telling, as it strongly suggests that voice search will become more prevalent over time; not just because of the improved technology at consumers’ disposal, but also because of an increased number of people who have grown up with voice search and are accustomed to using it. It is still noteworthy that so much of this increased usage relates to informational queries, nonetheless. The $37 billion per year search industry is predicated on the notion of choice, mainly within commercial queries. There may be one true answer to ‘What time is it?’, but ‘What should I buy to wear to the party on Saturday?’ opens itself up to any number of possibilities. Monetizing this new landscape The biggest challenge facing voice search providers as they try to monetize the increasing demand is that the interface simply doesn’t lend itself to advertising. We saw this very recently with the Beauty and the Beast ‘ad’ controversy, which was seen as invasive, primarily because if there is only one answer to a question, users are unwilling to accept an advertisement in place of a response. That issue aside, other questions remain unanswered. If users do start to conduct commercial queries and the response is multifaceted, the traditional SERP seems a much more fitting format than a single-answer interface. The question of how to monetize voice search has been raised repeatedly at Google’s quarterly earning meetings, so we can surmise that they will find a solution. We can expect Google to continue experimenting with ad formats for however long it takes to devise the right formula, while hopefully keeping its huge user base content along the way.

One prediction is that Google and Amazon will use the advent of augmented reality to provide multiple options in response to a voice-based query. This would be in keeping with the nature of this more futuristic interaction, as it would feel disjointed to speak to a digital assistant and simply see four PPC ads on a phone screen as the response. By creating an augmented reality-based search results page, search engines can sell advertising space and keep users satisfied. We have seen signs that this could be tested soon, with Amazon said to be exploring the possibility of opening augmented reality homeware stores. The irony of Amazon, they slayer of so many traditional stores, now taking a seemingly retrograde step by opening stores of its own, will not be lost on most in the industry. These will be much more than just traditional brick-and-mortar presences for the online giant, however, and will be more in line with its forays into grocery shopping. Now if we bring voice search and the Alexa digital assistant back into the frame, this all starts to fit together rather nicely. Voice search suddenly becomes a vehicle to showcase and provide a wide range of products and services, from timely reminders about appointments, to contextual ad placements in response to commercial queries. The more data is fed into this machine, the more accurate it becomes and – should privacy concerns be allayed or bludgeoned into submission – the happier the consumer will be with the results. In summary Voice search is not, on its own, the future of the search industry. One real, if slightly lofty, ambition is to arrive at query-less search, requiring neither a text nor a voice prompt for a digital assistant to spring into action. Another, more tangible and realistic goal, will be to use voice search to unify the varied touchpoints that make up the average consumer’s day. Though tangible and realistic in technological terms, this goal will remain tantalizingly out of reach if consumers use a variety of hardware providers and data is not shared across platforms, of course. Making all of this a “ubiquitous and seamless” experience will be hard for consumers to resist and will make it even harder for them to move to another provider and start the process over again. This will be the bargaining chip used to persuade consumers to stay loyal with Apple or Google products from home to car to work. Key points and predictions Search will adopt a more natural, conversational approach. We will be able to report on voice queries through SQR reports and Search Analytics, with digital assistants sharing their data. Long-tail keyword terms will become the focus of content strategy, as voice queries tend to be longer and more detailed. Content will provide direct answers to questions – but the focus will be on accuracy, rather than just brevity. The importance of being the one, correct answer to an informational query will grow. Optimized videos will see a rise in the search results, as this medium fits well with the voice search results interface. Google will experiment with new ways to monetize its Home product, albeit in subtler ways than the Beauty and the Beast faux-pas. Amazon, in particular, will use augmented reality to tie together its offline stores with its e-commerce experience. Google may experiment with augmented reality to provide a voice search interface that allows for paid ads. We will see the continued rise of query-less search, where digital assistants answer our questions pre-emptively. Think Google Next, rather than Google Now.

To bridge the quality education gap and provide students with tech-based learning solutions, Google.org today announced grants of USD 8.4 million to four Indian NGOs working to improve education in the country. Pratham Books StoryWeaver, Pratham Education Foundation, Million Sparks Foundation and Learning Equality are the four NGOs that will receive the grants over the next two years "to expand and scale the work" they have been doing. "We believe technology can help bridge the gap, it can get more books to students, more lesson plans to teachers, and classrooms to kids who can't get there themselves," Nick Cain, Programme Manager at Google.org, said. According to the company, the grants will be used to offer languge-oriented learning material, better training and support to teachers, and to support students beyond classroom learning. The Million Sparks Foundations with its digital content platform and social community 'ChalkLit' provides teachers with lessons plans, learning modules and videos, which are organised in accordance with the government certified curriculum standards. In December last year, the NGO was selected by Delhi State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) and currently provides training to over 60,000 school teachers through the ChalkLit app. "Our vision is to create a platform using which anyone can teach a child one lesson at a time. What we are trying to create are bite-sized curriculum-aligned sources, which are basically around one particular chapter. We are trying to create resources that are 360 degree learning solutions," Abhinav Mathur, Founder-Director, Million Sparks Foundation, said. While Pratham Education's hybrid learning program provides students with "self-driven" tablet-based solution, Pratham Books' StoryWeaver is an open-source online platform which allows teachers and parents to create and translate stories in over 67 languages. "So far we have provided about 26,000 children with 2,400 tablets in 400 villages of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The cost of this model is USD 10 per year per child, which is quite less compared to government's spending of USD 250 per year per child on primary education," Vinod Khanna of Pratham Education said. In association with local partner Motivation for Excellence, Learning Equality aims to "help educators access, organize and customize digital content, even in the most remote locations" through their platform 'Kolibri'.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 294 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares436 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Middlefinger Sorry I meant LP. Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that?

Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now.

Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? YaKillaCJ Updates do actually roll out to Xiaomi devices. This means that they also get security patches. Also across a wide variety of devices. mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. Middlefinger Except that you haven't demonstrated why im a hypocrite, at all. whispy_snippet I don't have to. You're doing it all by yourself. Middlefinger Nope, dont see anything hypocritical here. Not fitting your narrative doesn't equal hypocritical you know.. whispy_snippet "Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.." Do you have any idea how stupid this looks? Middlefinger Well Tizen isn't even theirs, you know that right? Like Android sort of was/is its open source, developed by the Linux Foundation. Samsung is a member and is using it. Its not as commonly used and isnt as well developed as Android, but it is at least independent of Googles dictatorship. I still see no hypocrisy there, i guess you dont know what the word actually means. whispy_snippet Geez, you're like Tim. Middlefinger So you couldn't argue, so used a straw man. Got it. whispy_snippet No, I'm wasting my energy on someone too egotistic and deluded to accept rhyme or reason. You're not just a hypocrite Samsung shill, you're deliberately obtuse and tedious to interact with. You're a waste of time. Middlefinger Again, no , i just dont agree with you. There is clear anti-samsung bias on here, from both the commenters and the contributors, even if its often covered by the begrudging acceptance that they make the best products. You keep thinking im a Samsung shill if you like, and wasting your time commenting based on that erroneous position. I will just carry on telling it as I see it, when Google does bad and Samsung does bad. whispy_snippet "even if its often covered by the begrudging acceptance that they make the best products." Perfect. Middlefinger Ill bite. Who makes better? HTC, nope. Sony? Niche at best, stale design. LG, floundering, but the G6 is at least good. OnePlus, oh please. Moto/Lenovo hahahaa. Pixel? Only if you are a SJW for AOSP. Huawei/ZTE etc. Not really, the hardware is lacking, the software often poor, the quality is superficial. Fact is the Galaxy S at least is clearly the best device. Its the most sorted and reliable, has the best hardware, the best design, the best software (desite what said AOSP fanboys think). whispy_snippet Game, set and match. Middlefinger OK so you aren't going to argue, that's fine, I guess you cant. People who wont state their position are unsure of it, you dont want to state your alternative best because you know it will get shot down. I guess this IS a waste of time. Your Blocked.. whispy_snippet Bye Tim II. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? Middlefinger I guess you know the history of Android, right? Its not originally Googles, and much of the code in current Android is community based, so again, not Google. M. Luciano You're out of your element Donnie. Middlefinger The only thing that bothers me here is the torrent of apologists and fanboys. Its hard to battle 10+ delusional people all at once. Nothing i said wasn't true, and yet again someone is arguing without providing any actual argument. M. Luciano Yeah that was because you didn't address my point and brought up something totally different that just sounds tangentially related, yet isn't. The issue is that Samsung is woefully ignorant of security best practices and the same cannot be said of Google, who is providing Samsung with the vast majority of their Android security related code. Yes, some of it comes from AOSP, but most of it comes from Google, regardless of whether or not they invented the OS. Middlefinger Tizen isnt a samsung OS, its open source. Its behind Android yes, but its improving as you can see if you actually look. Samsungs mistake might be using it at all, but it was kind of forced to do something because for the uses Samsung has for Tizen (its watches mainly), Android is god awful. Android was a terrible mess at the start to, and while Tizen isnt new, its got nothing like the activity Android gets. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ? Middlefinger But Tizen isnt Samsungs, its developed by the Linux Foundation and is open source. Samsung might use it, and help develop it, but its not their creation. At this point its just in a position that Android was maybe 8 years ago. Samsung is using it because its free of Googles controlling. JG This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places Why not error on the side of caution, encrypt everything!

A look inside the encrypted network infamously used to hide illegal online activity Secret section of the internet hidden from search engines is a hotspot for online illegal activity By Jennifer Hale 6th April 2017, 11:00 am Updated: 6th April 2017, 1:32 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments BELIEVE it or not, there are parts of the internet that Google can’t reach and users can operate anonymously. The dark web is made up of websites hidden from search engines that can only be accessed using special software. Alamy 5 The dark web is a network of websites that are not indexed by search engines such as Google The dark web is used by many people for different things but it’s infamously used by criminals to hide illegal activity online. So what exactly is the dark web, where did it come from and how does it work? What is the dark web? The internet is actually made up of three different layers: the surface web, the deep web and the dark web. The top layer, the surface web, are web pages that show up using search engines such as Google – like The Sun website that you’re looking at right now. The deep web are web pages that search engines can’t access and are therefore hidden, accessed via passwords and authorisation. Any time you log into an account you’re accessing deep web content that won’t show up on a search engine. For example, work intranets, password-protected areas of online banking and draft blog posts are all stored on the deep web. This means that if someone was to Google your name, your banking information or Amazon wishlist won’t show up in the results. The dark web is a network of untraceable online activity and websites on the internet. They cannot be found using search engines and to access them you need to use specific software, configurations or have authorisation. They are used by lots of different people to keep their web activity hidden. Where did the dark web come from? The dark web was actually created by the US government to allow spies to exchange information completely anonymously. US military researchers developed the technology, known as Tor (The Onion Router) in the mid 1990s and released it into the public domain for everyone to use. The reason was so that they could stay anonymous – it would be harder to distinguish the government’s messages between spies if thousands of other people were using the same system for tots of different things. Tor now hosts roughly 30,000 hidden sites. It’s called The Onion Router because it uses the technique of onion routing – making websites anonymous through layers of encryption. Most websites are also hosted on the .onion domain. Getty Images 5 Users of the dark web access websites using special browsers and software How does the dark web work? The best explanation so far has been published by Daniel Prince, Associate Director Security at Lancaster University, on website The Conversation. Mr Prince says: “So just for a minute imagine that the whole internet is a forest – a vast expanse of luscious green as far as the eye can see. And in the forest are well worn paths – to get from A to B. “Think of these paths as popular search engines – like Google – allowing you as the user the option to essentially see the wood from the trees and be connected. But away from these paths – and away from Google – the trees of the forest mask your vision. “Off the paths it is almost impossible to find anything – unless you know what you’re looking for – so it feels a bit like a treasure hunt. Because really the only way to find anything in this vast forest is to be told where to look. “This is how the dark web works – and it is essentially the name given to all the hidden places on the internet. “Just like the forest, the dark web hides things well – it hides actions and it hides identities. The dark web also prevents people from knowing who you are, what you are doing and where you are doing it.” PA:Press Association 5 One of the criminal uses of the dark web is to buy and sell drugs Who uses the dark web and why? The dark web is used by all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons  – but it’s not surprising that it’s used for illegal activity. A study by the University of Portsmouth in 2014 found that the most wanted type of content on Tor was child porn, followed by black markets for goods such as drugs, personal details and even guns. This type of site is regularly busted by police, who compromise them by distributing viruses and malware to users. The dark web is also used for hiding online activity related to finance, extremism, arms, hacking, abuse and fraud. However, for others the dark web has positive uses. For example, it can be used to avoid a national firewall, such as China, where users are normally blocked from accessing hidden sites. It can also be used as a tool for whistleblowing – infamous website WikiLeaks is hosted on the dark web, allowing whistleblowers to anonymously upload classified information to the press. Do police ever catch people using the dark web? Yes – although using the dark web makes it easier to evade detection but governments around the world are working to index, sort and catalogue the dark web as well as monitor it as much as they can. The UK government  have a dedicated cybercrime unit to tackle the dark web with a focus on taking down serious crime rings and child porn. Just earlier this year police caught Richard Huckle ‘Britain’s worst-ever paedophile’ by secretly taking over a dark web site dedicated to child abuse. Getty Images 5 Richard Huckle was handed 22 life sentences after pleading guilty to 71 child sex offences The online network was made up of over 45,000 people who swapped sickening videos and images of children on a dark-web forum which was only accessible through a specially encrypted browser. Another take-down, called Operation Onymous, revealed over 400 “hidden services” in an effort by seventeen different countries co-ordinated by Europol and the FBI. The operation led to hundreds of pounds worth of Bitcoin being seized and 17 arrests – but only one person was identified and taken into custody. Who is Ross Ulbricht? Ross Ulbricht was the man behind Silk Road, the internet’s biggest market for illegal drugs – which was hosted on the dark web. Silk Road was reportedly worth $34.5m and had nearly one million anonymous customers. On Silk Road you could buy drugs, services (such as hacking into Facebook accounts), pirated content, fake passports and more. You could even check the reviews and star ratings of each dealer left by other customers. Reuters 5 Ulbricht is in prison in New York after he was unmasked as the man behind dark web drugs emporium Silk Road Ulbricht was caught by the FBI in 2013, who shut down Silk Road and convicted him of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents and conspiracy to traffic narcotics in February 2015. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Arriving late for the music streaming party after Saavn and Gaana, the service arrived a lot later even compared to Apple’s iTunes, despite being built into almost every single Android smartphone since 2011. When it did arrive in India last year, Apple was still ahead with not just iTunes for buying music, but with Apple Music as well because Play Music only allowed for radio and paid downloads at launch. It’s 2017, and today, Google finally decided on letting its users in India get their hands on its All Access section, which is basically an “all you can eat” music subscription service. Aptly titled, it gives users access to 40 million music tracks in various languages and even lets you download them to your smartphones and hear them offline, similar to Apple Music. But there are a few differences. Price The price you pay to arrive late? Well, it’s evident from the way Google has priced its All Access music subscription service in India at just Rs 89. While it is way lower than Apple Music’s Rs 120 per month, this is just the introductory price. Google will hike the price for its subscription music service to Rs 99 per month after the first 45 days. It is still lower than Apple Music provided you are not a student as Apple offers a student account for a mere Rs 60 per month. So what if you don’t like it? Well, you can always unsubscribe from Play Music’s All Access as the service comes free for month (you will need to enter your credit card details). Apple on the other hand offers a three month free trial period. Features Google’s Play Music does offer a rather solid music collection for your listening pleasure. From what we have seen and used so far, the collections on Apple Music and All Access are similar and both offer radio station by genre and artist as well. What you also get with Apple Music is live radio stations. However, what is different with All Access is the fact that at Rs 99 (there is only one type of subscription), you don’t exactly get a family sharing option, one that lets you share your subscription service with more people. Again, you do not get access to YouTube Red (an ad-free version of YouTube) at that price either. The same is offered complimentary in the US. Apple on the other hand offers an individual membership at Rs 120 and at Rs 190 per month also allows for Family Sharing with up to six people. Platforms Apple Music clearly has been built for the iOS and MacOS ecosystem with limited availability on Android with Windows availability only via its iTunes software. If there’s one thing we know about Google, its that Google is always web first. And that’s where it has an edge out here when it comes to the number of supported platforms. Play Music’s All Access is not only available on your Android smartphone and tablet, but on your iPhone, iPad, and every other device that comes with a web browser (Google Play website). The web is Apple’s sore spot and it is the very one that Google dominates. Play Music, becomes a clear winner here, as it is available on your web browser as well. The bottom line gets pretty clear if you are an Android smartphone user (you have really waited a long time for this one). But even if you come from iOS or MacOS, Google Play Music’s pricing along with flexibility of use across platforms does make it worth a try.

Stick another device inside, apparently. A source speaking to the Information claims that an upcoming Home model will include a built-in WiFi router with mesh networking. You wouldn't need to buy a separate router (like, say, Google WiFi) just to connect devices around your household. And even if you already have a router, this would improve Home's performance by giving it a stronger connection in weak coverage areas. The tipster also maintains that the original version of Google WiFi had a microphone and speaker for Home-style interactions, but that Google axed it to avoid confusion. It's possible that this version would come back, the source says, but there don't appear to be any definite plans. There's no mention of a launch date or a price for the router-equipped Home, and that last part is particularly important. If Google asks for no more than the $180 of the Echo, it could lure buyers who want more value out of a speaker or a router. If it's significantly more expensive, however, it might be a tougher decision. Do you really want to pay a premium just to get two devices in one? Google is building momentum for Home, but that doesn't mean that has the cachet needed to justify a higher price.

The search giant teased the industry with the initial announcement last year, however details were relatively thin. The latest shout-out is accompanied with a white paper, which will be presented at a National Academy of Engineering meeting, claiming the TPU is 15x to 30x faster than contemporary GPUs and CPUs, as well as 30x to 80x more energy efficient in certain circumstances. “The need for TPUs really emerged about six years ago, when we started using computationally expensive deep learning models in more and more places throughout our products,” said Norm Jouppi, Distinguished Hardware Engineer at Google. “The computational expense of using these models had us worried. “If we considered a scenario where people use Google voice search for just three minutes a day and we ran deep neural nets for our speech recognition system on the processing units we were using, we would have had to double the number of Google data centres.” Artificial intelligence, and in particular machine learning technologies, are now playing a crucial role in the effectiveness of the Google business. More than 100 teams are using various machine learning components to power the Google engine, from Street View, to Inbox Smart Reply, to voice search. Just to put the challenge into perspective, Jouppi was worried about having to double data centre capabilities; Google already operates 15 data centres around the world. Doubling this footprint would be an astronomical headache both practically and financially. The Google business is reliant on the successful delivery of adverts, which increasingly have to be relevant to user preferences, mood, activities and general state of play; artificial intelligence is key to comprehending all of this data to create a more personalized experience. The status quo had to change to ensure Google was meeting the demands of advertisers and users, while also maintaining a profitability which would be seen as attractive to investors. The TPU operates in the space which Google has described as neural network inference, essentially the data crunching and training phase, where predictions are made to reinforce and improve performance. Its data heavy and very demanding from a performance perspective. Last year, Jouppi wrote: “TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation. Because of this, we can squeeze more operations per second into the silicon, use more sophisticated and powerful machine learning models and apply these models more quickly, so users get more intelligent results more rapidly. A board with a TPU fits into a hard disk drive slot in our data centre racks.” With such bold claims, many businesses might be tempted into moving into the licensing and hardware game, but we don’t think this is going to be the case; it moves too far away from Google’s core business. Yes, the company is trying to diversify the technology in which it invests, but all of these examples can be tied back to data collection, ultimately feeding the artificial intelligence machine which is ever improving Google’s ability to tell us where to eat lunch. Perhaps the most significant takeaway from this move, is the position which this ultimately leaves Google in. Should the claims prove to be correct, the chip moves the search-giant years ahead of the competition, in a field which could potentially decide the technology leaders of tomorrow.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Judge threatens injunction if Uber doesn’t work harder to find stolen Google Waymo docs Judge threatens injunction if Uber doesn’t work harder to find stolen Google Waymo docs By Ryan Whitwam on April 6, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Uber had a bad day in court on Wednesday during the ongoing trade secret litigation case brought by Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car division that grew out of a Google project. US District Judge William Alsup was not satisfied that Uber had made a good-faith effort to find more than 14,000 documents allegedly taken to Uber by former Googler Anthony Levandowski. The judge has hinted he could slap Uber with an injunction that would stall its self-driving car project. According to Waymo, Anthony Levandowski obtained the files shortly before he left an engineering position at Google. The documents were copied to a laptop, which was later wiped clean by Levandowski before being returned to Google. Waymo alleges this data (more than 10GB of it) included the designs for its lidar system and custom circuit boards. Google was understandably suspicious when Levandowski popped up as the head of Uber’s self-driving car division not long after. As part of the case, which was filed in February, Judge Alsup ordered Uber to produce the 14,000 documents by the end of March. Alsup is not pleased that the deadline came and went without any word from Uber. No one is denying that Levandowski took the documents from Google when he left, but he’s refusing to cooperate on Fifth Amendment grounds. Meanwhile, Uber claims it had no knowledge of Levandowski’s actions, and it doesn’t have the files. An Uber self-driving prototype. At the hour-long hearing, Uber’s lawyer attempted to explain why it hadn’t produced the documents. “We searched 12 terabytes of data in two weeks,” said Uber lawyer Arturo Gonzalez. While there were 3,100 hits, Gonzalez said none of the files it has contain Waymo trade secrets. Basically, Uber claims Levandowski never provided the documents to Uber. Alsup, who you may remember from the Google-Oracle case, didn’t care for that explanation. “This is an extraordinary case. In 42 years, I’ve never seen a record this strong. You are up against it,” Alsup told Uber’s counsel. Levandowski is still technically in charge of Uber’s self-driving car project, but that could change. Judge Alsup said in the hearing that he may very well issue an injunction that prevents Levandowski from working on any self-driving car projects at Uber. It’s not really in dispute that he took the files, which have yet to be returned. Wednesday’s hearing ended with Uber agreeing to search its servers using 15 terms of Waymo’s choosing. Levandowski’s Fifth Amendment argument will be addressed in a future hearing.

HTC U Ocean with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, Edge Sense to launch in April Home > Technology > Google donates over Rs 54 crore in India to improve education quality India Today Tech Last Updated: APR 06, 2017 New Delhi Email Author Google.org, which is the tech companies arm for philanthropy, on Thursday announced grants of $8.4 million (a little over Rs 54 crore) to four Indian NGOs. The money will be given to the Learning Equality, Million Sparks Foundation, Pratham Books StoryWeaver, and Pratham Education Foundation over the next two years so that these NGOs can expand and scale the work they are doing to improve quality of education in India. These grants are part of a global $50 million commitment that Google.org has made for the groups working on tech-based learning solutions. Google.org said that although the Right to Education Act in 2010 has improved access to education, the quality of education remains a concern. It notes that studies show a decline in learning levels among school students. "MHRD data indicates there are about 260 million children enrolled in schools across the country, but a recent survey by Pratham Education reveals 50 per cent of all children in 5th grade cannot read a 2nd grade text or do a two-digit subtraction problem," the company said in a statement. Also Read: Twitter Lite for India launched, now see tweets even when offline"We believe technology can help bridge the gap, it can get more books to students, more lesson plans to teachers, and classrooms to kids who can't get there themselves.  At Google.org, we are committed to support and work alongside these organisations to bridge the quality education gap," said Nick Cain, program manager (education) at Google.org. Google said that the education grants in India will focus on three areas where technology can be used to improve the quality of education. "First is to make available quality learning material that overcome language and connectivity gaps. Second is to provide better training and support to teachers as they are key to educational outcomes. Finally, it is to support students beyond classroom learning," the company said.

The NGOs include Learning Equality (USD 500,000), Million Sparks Foundation (USD 1.2 million), Pratham Books StoryWeaver (USD 3.6 million), and Pratham Education Foundation (USD 3.1 million). They will receive the grant for two years to expand and scale the work they are doing. These grants are part of a global USD 50 million commitment that Google.org has made towards supporting non-profit entities that are building tech-based learning solutions. "These grants will be used to scale existing initiatives to reach more children and build more innovative and engaging tech-based learning solutions to close the gap in learning and academic opportunity," Google Vice-President South East Asia and India Rajan Anandan said at an event here. Various studies show a decline in learning levels among school students. While data indicate that there are about 260 million children enrolled in schools across the country, there are studies that show that many children in fifth grade cannot read a second-grade text or solve a two-digit subtraction problem. In the National Policy on Education report 2016, poor learning outcomes have been attributed to serious gaps in teacher motivation and training. Lack of access to relevant educational material, tools, and aids that enhance classroom experience are some of the other areas that must be addressed."Google has never taken a conventional approach to solving problems and neither does Google.org. Our approach is to find the most promising non-profits and help them close this gap," Anandan said. Google will offer mentorship as well as access to its products to help these NGOs. "We believe that technology can help bridge the gap, it can get more books to students, more lesson plans to teachers, and classrooms to kids who can't get there themselves," Nick Cain, Programme Manager (Education) at Google.org, said. The grants in India will focus on three areas -- making available learning material that overcomes language and connectivity gaps, providing better training and support to teachers and supporting students beyond classroom learning.

Apr 6, 2017 • 8:13 am | (12) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Was Ashley Madison's web site penalized by Google months ago? Maybe. Marie Haynes posted in the Google Webmasters Help forum examples showing the "mysterious" ranking issue for the controversial business and web site, AshleyMadison.com. In short, if you search for [Ashley Madison] or even misspellings of the name, it won't come up on the first page in Google.com results. This is what I see: Notice the fake domain ranking pretty well, it seems like an affiliate. Marie seemed to have been hired by Ashley Madison to debug the issues and she is seeking advice. She said the "site was hacked and had a lot of publicity about this hack in July of 2015, four months before the ranking troubles happened, but I don’t think that the problems are connected to the hack." She even shared a screen shot from their Google Search Console Search Analytics report: This shows a massive dive in traffic from Google for people searching on their business name in Google starting in November 2016. I did try to bring John Mueller from Google into the conversation but he replied with a joke: @JosueGio @rustybrick @ashleymadison @Marie_Haynes @methode @vindiesel Better hope he doesn't make a movie called Fast & Furious: South East Oregon. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) April 5, 2017 A site typically won't rank for its name if the site is blocking Google from their home page, asked to be deindexed, was hacked or there is a pretty big penalty.

When your door is jammed you look up a locksmith. And when you need targeted surveillance of a smartphone, you call your cyberarms dealer. Naturally! For bad actors and nation states, sometimes all it takes to access someone’s private text messages, browsing history, calls, emails, calendar, location, contacts, and apps, is a big enough check. Although maybe not as big as you’d think. Researchers from the mobile security firm Lookout and Google’s Android security team revealed evidence this week of a type of mobile spyware for Android that masquerades as a normal app download, while secretly gaining root access to a device to do broad surveillance on the user over time. Lookout, working with Citizen Lab, a human rights and global security research group, discovered a similar malicious product for iOS last year. Called Pegasus, the malware appeared to originate from the Israeli spy technology company NSO Group. Since NSO Group also advertises the product for Android, Lookout got to work trying to find proof that it exists. It didn’t take long. “We knew we’d find it,” says Mike Murray, the vice president of security intelligence at Lookout. “It was just a question of when and where in the data. It’s important to understand the pervasiveness of this. This stuff is being used by all sorts of nation-state advanced attackers around the world for whatever their aims are. And their aims are more broad than we necessarily think about.” More Malware Lily Hay Newman A Hacking Group Is Selling iPhone Spyware to Governments Andy Greenberg Good News: Android’s Huge Security Problem Is Getting Less Huge Kim Zetter Researchers Find and Decode the Spy Tools Governments Use to Hijack Phones That isn’t cause for you specifically to worry. Google checked data from the Verify Apps software security scanner it has on 1.4 billion devices around the world and found possible downloads of Pegasus for Android (also called Chrysaor) on fewer than 40 devices total, in countries including Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates. Google says it notified all of those users about the potential danger and blocked the malware. A few dozen devices is a very small population, but the software provides virtually complete access and control on a device. This isn’t some credit card theft or prescription drug scam. It’s complete ownership of data about a person’s entire digital life. Reports indicate that it costs a few hundred thousand dollars to get up and running with this type of NSO Group tool, and then costs tens of thousands of dollars for each target a customer wants to use the product on. Think of it like a licensing fee. The cost is relatively small, especially in the context of the types of coffers that comprise NSO’s clientele, but high enough that you probably wouldn’t install it on every phone out there. Murray says that the cost of using the iOS and Android tools is comparable, from what he has seen. The malicious app download was never available in the Google Play Store, and was probably distributed to targets using links in specially crafted text messages, as was the case with the iOS version. Pegasus for iOS exploited a series of rare and valuable zero day (previously unknown and therefore unpatched) bugs in iOS to gain full access. In the case of the Android version, though, the malware exploits a known rooting method called Framaroot. Since it’s open source, Android can be infinitely altered and adjusted, but this can make it difficult to distribute security updates widely, since not all patches and protections become available for all “forks” (independent versions) of the operating system. As a result, it is easier to use old vulnerabilities to target Android users, because a portion of the population will generally still be vulnerable to a given attack months or years after a patch comes out. And even if a potential victim downloads Pegasus for Android on a device that has all the most recent security updates, the spyware can still work if the user mistakenly grants approval through Android’s permissions system. The malware is also difficult to detect. It has self-destruct mechanisms built in to wipe it off devices, and can even block certain patches and scans that could nullify it. But Lookout knew the types of things that characterized the NSO Group’s Pegasus tool on iOS, and was able to look for evidence of the Android version in anonymous data it has collected from more than 100 million of its customers’ devices. “With the iOS version [of Pegasus] we started to learn about how NSO builds software and how they do their job. We noticed common standards in the way they write code, common infrastructure that they’ve used,” says Murray. “So we found a bunch of initial candidates [in our data] that looked very promising, some of which were incredibly promising and actually turned out to be the real thing.” Google says it has disabled the malicious application on infected devices, and has updated its Verify Apps service to protect the overall Android population. Some samples of Pegasus for Android date back to 2014, though, so it seems likely that NSO Group and other cyberarms dealers have developed even more sophisticated techniques since then. “I don’t think this is the end to this story,” Murray says. “They’re evolving. I think the next round is going to be even more interesting.” Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. android ios nso group spyware Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Twitter Facebook Trust issues: Know the limits of SSL certificates All SSL certs are not created equal, and web browsers make matters worse by not clearly showing what security you’re actually getting Fahmida Y. Rashid (InfoWorld) 06 April, 2017 20:00 - - - - print email Comments Certificate authorities (CAs) have given themselves a black eye lately, making it hard for users to trust them. Google stopped trusting Symantec after discovering the CA had mis-issued thousands of certificates over several years, and researchers found that phishing sites were using PayPal-labeled certificates issued by Linux Foundation’s Let’s Encrypt CA. Even with these missteps, the CAs play a critical role in establishing trust on the internet. CAs issue different types of certificates, and each type addresses a different internet security use case. Here’s what you need to understand about certificates and online trust, so you know what is happening behind HTTPS—especially now that free CAs have made it so easy to get certificates. [ 18 surprising tips for security pros. | Discover how to secure your systems with InfoWorld's Security Report newsletter. ] How certificate authorities lost your trust Let’s Encrypt, a free CA operated by the Linux Foundation’s Internet Security Research Group, is taking a pounding for issuing 15,270 certificates containing the word “PayPal” in either the domain name or the certificate identity. The sites using those certificates weren’t PayPal properties, and nearly all (97 percent) of the domains hosted phishing pages, said researcher and encryption expert Vincent Lynch. A researcher earlier this year found issues with several hundred Symantec-issued certificates, prompting Google to conduct its own investigation. After discovering that Symantec allowed other parties access to its certificate infrastructure and did not oversee the process sufficiently, Google Chrome developers said they “no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years.” Symantec has promised to reissue all its Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates to comply with Google’s new validity period requirements. Those are only two examples. There have been missteps by other CAs over the past few years that have led to the current doubts about their trustworthiness. What the different certificates actually mean There are many reasons a domain owner may decide to obtain a TLS/SSL certificate, but the most common one is to give users a way to verify that the site is authentic and the owner is legitimate. Another reason is that—in this day of rampant surveillance, tracking, and eavesdropping—there is growing interest in encrypting all traffic moving from the user’s computer or mobile device and the web server hosting the application. These are two distinct reasons for getting certificates, but both rely on HTTPS. That HTTPS reliance has made it easy for domain owners and internet users to conflate the two, causing further confusion beyond the trust issues, said Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of web security company High-Tech Bridge. “We should separate the HTTP traffic encryption and website identity verification questions. There are three main types of certificates: Domain-validated (DV) certificates are checked against the domain registry but don’t require any identifying information to prove the owner is who it says it is. All DV certificates do is tell visitors the domain they think they are visiting matches the domain listed in the certificate. That lets domain owners be spoofed, though the sites have certificates. Extended-validation (EV) certificates tell visitors the owner of the domain they are visiting has been validated and is the real owner. To get an EV certificate, the requester provides information verifying identity, making it harder—although not impossible—to obtain a fraudulent one. Organization-validated (OV) certificates also verify identity, but they require less information than EV certificates, so they’re a bit easier to get fraudulently. However, they aren’t as common as EV certs. Where the primary goal is to validate a website as authentic, the website should have an EV or OV certificate. Thus, users know the CA has received proof that the entity applying for the certificate is the legitimate owner. A user doesn’t need to view the actual certificate to tell that a website is using an EV or OV certificate because the browser’s address bar displays the name of the domain owner next to a padlock. For example, for PayPal, in most browsers you’d see the closed padlock icon and the words “PayPal, Inc. [US],” then the actual PayPal URL with the HTTPS prefix. In Internet Explorer, hovering over the domain owner’s name also shows the name of the CA that issued the certificate. By contrast, users can tell in most browsers if a site has only a DV certificate because there is the padlock icon or the word “Secure” in the address bar next to the URL (again, with the HTTPS prefix). However, you won’t see the name of the domain owner also listed, as you do for EV and OV certs. IDG Look carefully at the address bars of the four major desktop browsers to see how they indicate SSL certificates. If a site has an EV or OV cert, you'll see the name of the domain owner in addition to the padlock icon. Where the primary goal is to encrypt communications, it doesn’t matter what cert type a site uses—they all provide the same encryption of the communications in transit. A (cheaper) DV certificate can be sufficient if it’s not important for the domain owner to prove (via a pricier EV or OV certificate) who owns the site (because there is no financial information or sensitive user information shared). Regaining trust in certificates TLS/SSL certificates have a usability problem because web browsers mark all HTTPS websites as secure—and users have been trained to look for the padlock or the word “Secure” to determine the site’s legitimacy. Yet all that padlock or the word “Secure” indicate is that the communications is encrypted. It doesn’t say the owner has been validated. A site can be encrypted and still be unsafe because the owner has been spoofed by a phisher or other malevolent force. Web browsers have done a great job of making certificate information much more visible—but let’s break the overreliance on the little padlock. Until browser makers fix how they indicate what is actually secured, all users can do is look for the domain owner’s name to be shown separately from the URL. That’s the only clue that the site owner’s identity has been confirmed. The padlock icon or the word “Secure” doesn’t tell you that. But better showing which domains are validated, not simply encrypted, is not the only step the industry needs to take. It also needs to raise and enforce better standards for the CAs to follow. It is easy to rag on the free ones, but sloppy, cheap practices can happen to any CA, as Symantec’s case has shown. It’s just that free CAs make it easier for criminals to get a certificate, an inevitable result of making security more ubiquitous and easy to use. I don’t agree with security experts who say free and low-cost CAs should filter our certain substrings to prevent phishing sites from spoofing popular brands. Such approaches put CAs in a very powerful position of deciding what kind of content can go online, which is a dangerous precedent to set. For example, PayPal shouldn’t have exclusive control of the substring; for example, a disgruntled user should be able to set up IHatePayPal.com. But the industry can take action to raise the level of trust. Having better audit tools for certificate transparency and antiphishing filters would limit the amount of damage malicious websites can cause, for example. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

NordVPN India’s Economic Times reports that the service will cost Rs89/month ($1.38) for those signing up in the next 45 days, and Rs99/month ($1.53) afterwards. This compares with the Rs120/month ($1.86) cost for Apple Music. Google also seems to be working hard to include music from the region. At the time of writing this article, we noticed the service offers music across various languages like Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Western, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Gujarati, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and World. While neither company can be making any significant income from such heavily-discounted rates, both will be taking a long-term view, hoping that if you bring people into the ecosystem now their lifetime value to the company will be significant. As I recently outlined, India is currently a tiny market for Apple, but a huge population and growing middle-class makes it one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Smartphone shipments in India, for example, grew by 18% against a worldwide average of just 3%. It’s for this reason that Apple is working so hard to establish a greater foothold in the country through initiatives like local manufacturing, retail stores and support for app developers. Google will be doing all it can to promote its own ecosystem for the same reasons. Ben Lovejoy @benlovejoy Ben Lovejoy is a British technology writer and EU Editor for 9to5Mac.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 294 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares436 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Middlefinger Sorry I meant LP. Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? YaKillaCJ Updates do actually roll out to Xiaomi devices. This means that they also get security patches. Also across a wide variety of devices. mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. Middlefinger Except that you haven't demonstrated why im a hypocrite, at all. whispy_snippet I don't have to. You're doing it all by yourself. Middlefinger Nope, dont see anything hypocritical here. Not fitting your narrative doesn't equal hypocritical you know.. whispy_snippet "Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.." Do you have any idea how stupid this looks? Middlefinger Well Tizen isn't even theirs, you know that right? Like Android sort of was/is its open source, developed by the Linux Foundation. Samsung is a member and is using it. Its not as commonly used and isnt as well developed as Android, but it is at least independent of Googles dictatorship. I still see no hypocrisy there, i guess you dont know what the word actually means. whispy_snippet Geez, you're like Tim. Middlefinger So you couldn't argue, so used a straw man. Got it. whispy_snippet No, I'm wasting my energy on someone too egotistic and deluded to accept rhyme or reason. You're not just a hypocrite Samsung shill, you're deliberately obtuse and tedious to interact with. You're a waste of time. Middlefinger Again, no , i just dont agree with you. There is clear anti-samsung bias on here, from both the commenters and the contributors, even if its often covered by the begrudging acceptance that they make the best products. You keep thinking im a Samsung shill if you like, and wasting your time commenting based on that erroneous position. I will just carry on telling it as I see it, when Google does bad and Samsung does bad. whispy_snippet "even if its often covered by the begrudging acceptance that they make the best products." Perfect. Middlefinger Ill bite. Who makes better? HTC, nope. Sony? Niche at best, stale design. LG, floundering, but the G6 is at least good. OnePlus, oh please. Moto/Lenovo hahahaa. Pixel? Only if you are a SJW for AOSP. Huawei/ZTE etc. Not really, the hardware is lacking, the software often poor, the quality is superficial. Fact is the Galaxy S at least is clearly the best device. Its the most sorted and reliable, has the best hardware, the best design, the best software (desite what said AOSP fanboys think). whispy_snippet Game, set and match. Middlefinger OK so you aren't going to argue, that's fine, I guess you cant. People who wont state their position are unsure of it, you dont want to state your alternative best because you know it will get shot down. I guess this IS a waste of time. Your Blocked.. whispy_snippet Bye Tim II. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? Middlefinger I guess you know the history of Android, right? Its not originally Googles, and much of the code in current Android is community based, so again, not Google. M. Luciano You're out of your element Donnie. Middlefinger The only thing that bothers me here is the torrent of apologists and fanboys. Its hard to battle 10+ delusional people all at once. Nothing i said wasn't true, and yet again someone is arguing without providing any actual argument. M. Luciano Yeah that was because you didn't address my point and brought up something totally different that just sounds tangentially related, yet isn't. The issue is that Samsung is woefully ignorant of security best practices and the same cannot be said of Google, who is providing Samsung with the vast majority of their Android security related code. Yes, some of it comes from AOSP, but most of it comes from Google, regardless of whether or not they invented the OS. Middlefinger Tizen isnt a samsung OS, its open source. Its behind Android yes, but its improving as you can see if you actually look. Samsungs mistake might be using it at all, but it was kind of forced to do something because for the uses Samsung has for Tizen (its watches mainly), Android is god awful. Android was a terrible mess at the start to, and while Tizen isnt new, its got nothing like the activity Android gets. ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ? Middlefinger But Tizen isnt Samsungs, its developed by the Linux Foundation and is open source. Samsung might use it, and help develop it, but its not their creation. At this point its just in a position that Android was maybe 8 years ago. Samsung is using it because its free of Googles controlling. JG This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places Why not error on the side of caution, encrypt everything!

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 48 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Roger Siegenthaler You do know what frand is... the point of frand is so standardised systems can't be abused by the patent holders (Qualcomm)... There's nothing that apple does that should be standardised and therefore nothing they could contribute to the frand pool. Drakenoid There actually are things Apple can contribute but they don't, like their processor tech. Roger Siegenthaler What about their processor? a) not a standardised thing (the standard is ARM, go bully them into being frand) b) are any competitor processor techs license under frand? Answer's no. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Funem Microsoft make money on Android phone sales due to patents. In theory they have nothing to gain from joining as they would lose they money. Syukri Lajin they are trying to put their products into android phones. and getting in good term with android makers is the first step to this. they might be losing money for the patents, but they can offset it by putting their software and services into the phone,which is also better for long term profit. the bad news for us is that we'll get more bloatware. lol Funem They make literally billions every year from Android phone sales, they wont write that off just to put their products onto other manufacturers devices, they would make a deal to reduce payments to put their products onto them (they are already doing this with Samsung) but I doubt if they would join and write their royalties completely off, they would lose all their income from Android sales AND lose all their ability to leverage their software onto other manufacturers devices as manufacturers would have free access to all the patents with no obligations to Microsoft to add their products to their devices. Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Gerardo Sarabia Did you even read my comment? First thing I said is I know it had nothing to do with Android/PAX. YuCMi That doesn't change the validity of the rest of my comment. The beginning of your second sentence confused me, which is why I did not pick up on you saying Waymo is unrelated. Still though, your comment was completely off topic from Pax. Infringing on patents can happen involuntarily, and are more of a case of copying or reproducing. What happened with Waymo is actual theft, breaches of legal contracts, and conspiracy, among other things. Gerardo Sarabia Yeah... who cares how it happened. Either you are copying or not. Either you are open about sharing those ideas so costumers benefit from competition, or you aren't. I understand the difference, don't get me wrong, but this has been the argument Google (now Alphabet) has been giving the media and users for a long time. Now that I think about it, it actually has a lot to do with PAX, big coincidence PAX is happening now that Google is making hardware, they need freedom around those patents more than ever, not for Android but for themselves. Basically Google can get away with entering iOS/Apple's market and even use Oracle's Java in order to do so, but Uber shouldn't? I understand the difference from stealing and copying but there's clearly some conflict on these ideals. Maybe Waymo should just sue the guy that stole those files instead of Uber if that's the problem. YuCMi No, there is no conflict. You are just making it up in your head because you seem to have this idea that Google should be passive about everything and not defend itself. It seems that you are not well informed about the history of Google's Java/Oracle lawsuit either. Gerardo Sarabia Hahaha, okay I'm just crazy then, I'm making everything up on my mind. what's the point of even arguing with you. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross.

Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel. Drakenoid I would love Android Pay with MST!!! That would be dream come true! Also fast wireless charging!!! Though I am sure Samsung doesn't hold the patent for hybrid wireless those are held by the alliances.

Called Chrysaor, the spyware seems to be linked to Pegasus, a notorious program found to be targeting iPhone users last year and is suspected of being created by Israeli firm NSO Group Technologies. Google and Lookout announced the discovery of the spyware last week. The app which, was not available to download from Google Play, has been discovered on less than three dozen devices. This Android malware hacks into your Google account, installs third-party apps “A few [potentially harmful application] authors spend substantial effort, time, and money to create and install their harmful app on one or a very small number of devices,” said Google in a blog post. “This is known as a targeted attack.” NSO Group Technologies has previously been accused of targeting human rights activist based in the Middle East with its Pegasus iOS malware and was possibly trying something similar with the Android version. “To install Chrysaor, we believe an attacker coaxed specifically targeted individuals to download the malicious software onto their device,” said Google. Over 900m Android phones at risk of being hacked “Once Chrysaor is installed, a remote operator is able to surveil the victim’s activities on the device and within the vicinity, leveraging microphone, camera, data collection, and logging and tracking application activities on communication apps such as phone and SMS.” The likelihood of being affected by such as spyware maybe small, however Google recommends users take precautionary measures such as installing apps only from reputable sources and keeping devices up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect themselves.

Google Play Music vs Apple Music: Which is best? Google Play Music vs Apple Music - which one is better? Let's take a look. Written by Anuj Bhatia | New Delhi | Updated: April 6, 2017 10:15 pm Google Play Music vs Apple Music: which is better? While streaming music over the internet is still a niche in India, it has become a popular way to consume music among the next-gen. With Google Play Music subscription service finally made its way to India, we’ve decided to compare it with Apple Music. Read on for all of the details… Google Play Music vs Apple Music: Pricing Google is offering a 30-day trial and if the consumer subscribes within 45 days, you will get the service at a discounted price of Rs. 89 per month. It must be noted though that users have to pay Rs. 99 per month afterwards. Unlike Apple Music, there’s no family plan or student offers. Apple Music costs Rs 120 a month per user. Apple is also offering a plan for an entire family of six for Rs. 190 per month. Plus, there’s a special plan for students which will cost Rs.60 per month. Just in case you’re not aware, Apple Music offers a three-month free trial. After that you’ll need to start paying. Google Play Music vs Apple Music: Devices All Android devices support Google Play Music, obviously. Plus, it’s also available on iOS as well as the PC. Apple Music, on the other hand, is available for iOS, Android, Mac, PC, and Android. Google Play Music vs Apple Music: Streaming quality Google Play Music streams at 320 kb/s while Apple Music streams at 256 kb/s. It won’t make much of a difference though. In case you really care about the audio quality, Google Play Music is the service to subscribe. Google Play Music streams at 320 kb/s while Apple Music streams at 256 kb/s. Google Play Music vs Apple Music: Library The two services have the same number of tracks – 40 million. While both service offer a vast selection of music, they are quite different actually. Apple has tried to create a curated streaming service with focus on a lot of exclusive. A feature like Connect allow users to receive curated music from content creators  they follow. Also, Apple has its own radio station called Beats 1 which quite often features special appearances by major artists. Somehow I feel that Apple Music has an edge over Google Play Music in terms of exclusive features. Google Play Music vs Apple Music: Interface Of course, the striking difference between Google Play Music and Apple Music is the user interface. Initially I wasn’t keen to stick to Apple Music due to its confusing interface. However, the interface has been much improved over a period of time. In case of Google Play Music, the interface is bright though, but the design is fairly straight forward. Again, it all boils down to personal preference. Google Play Music vs Apple Music: Conclusion Both Apple Music and Google Play Music offer the exact same service. And to be honest, there is very little to choose between them. My recommendation would be to look out for local content and exclusive features. Which streaming service are you using?

The need for such a chip became evident about six years ago with the growth in computational expense due to technologies like Google voice search taxing the deep neural net speech recognition systems. With help from the likes of Norman Jouppi, one of the chief architects at MIPS, Google introduced servers packing its TPU chips back in 2015 (quite a quick development cycle). The new processors were designed with the particular focus of AI workloads and are thus ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). Now, for the first time, Google has measured the performance of its TPU systems and compared them to contemporary alternative processing solutions. In a blog post, Google sums up the benefits of its TPU over contemporary GPUs and CPUs as follows: On our production AI workloads that utilize neural network inference, the TPU is 15x to 30x faster than contemporary GPUs and CPUs. The TPU also achieves much better energy efficiency than conventional chips, achieving 30x to 80x improvement in TOPS/Watt measure (tera-operations [trillion or 1012 operations] of computation per Watt of energy consumed). The neural networks powering these applications require a surprisingly small amount of code: just 100 to 1500 lines. The code is based on TensorFlow, our popular open-source machine learning framework. TOPS/s = tera-operations per second Jouppi talked to The Next Platform about the TPU design. Interestingly, the Google distinguished hardware engineer explained "The TPU is programmable like a CPU or GPU. It isn’t designed for just one neural network model; it executes CISC instructions on many networks (convolutional, LSTM models, and large, fully connected models). So it is still programmable, but uses a matrix as a primitive instead of a vector or scalar." This processor is nearer to the spirit of an FPU than a GPU, added Jouppi. For further illumination regarding the TPU performance and efficiency a couple of graphs would be useful. Luckily Google has provided some and you can glance over them, above and below. The TPU' is an improved TPU As well as the above cited common workload example of voice search, which prompted the design of this ASIC, the TPU powered servers are of great utility for; translation services, image search and indexing, cloud vision and more.

The researchers have developed an easy trick to fool the system by simply inserting still photo periodically into the video and that's all that takes to fool the "deep-learning" classifier. Previously Google had described their technology as a deep-learning classifier has been developed using different frameworks like TensorFlow and then applied on large scale platforms such as YouTube. Nevertheless, the researcher from the university was able to easily manipulate the results. In their research paper, the researchers explained how the manipulation can fool the so-called super intelligent AI. They wrote that the research team altered Google's demo video by inserting one picture of an Audi after every couple of seconds and this is why, although, the actual video is about tigers, Google AI classified that the media is about cars. That is not it, researchers also experimented with a video of primatologist Jane Goodall and some apes. They inserted a picture of a bowl of pasta into the video in regular intervals and that resulted into Google AI classifying the video under the spaghetti theme instead of gorillas. This research proves that an adversary could easily get away with posting an illegal content, just by incorporating a benign image into the media. As per Digital Trends, the fact that fooling an AI developed by Google doesn't even require any knowledge about AI and its algorithms is particularly disturbing. At last the research paper explained that AI still has a long way to go to match humans' capabilities in areas such as determining what a video is all about. Subliminal messages might affect the human psyche but humans are very less likely to think a video with a clear topic is actually about something totally unrelated just due to some pictures inside it.

The virtual AI-led assistant provides a glimpse into the future of how people will interact with their increasingly smart homes. Like the Echo, Google Home’s aim is to aid people in their daily lives, whether that be answering questions in super-fast time or waking an individual up with their favourite song. “Google must be desperate to avoid another Google Glass-style disaster, but luckily it could be onto a winner with Google Home,” says Perry Krug, principal architect at Couchbase EMEA. >See also: Smart home technology at a tipping point in the UK “So far the connected home ideal has lacked an effective and attractive hub, allowing devices and services to cohesively talk to each other: by providing this, virtual assistants may become the most important brick in the connected home.” “With developments in natural language voice recognition, AI and machine learning, and its near endless supply of internet search and mobile data, Google is in prime position to become this hub. However, it must be noted that Amazon arguably has superior data on what its users are doing in the physical world.” Data will certainly be crucial in delivering the most personalised experience to users. As smart devices become more ingrained into houses and the virtual assistant’s technology advances, this will extend from regulating heating to running the shower/bath at a predetermined time. However, at the moment, like PCs and smartphones before, virtual assistants will be fairly ‘basic’ in their capacity. At first, suggests Krug, “they will only be able to perform everyday tasks, such as asking for train times and controlling other smart devices. However, as these devices learn more about us and new applications are launched, they will be able to provide a much deeper and more valuable service.” >See also: Google Assistant vs Amazon Alexa: which is the best intelligent assistants? What will it take for Google Home to succeed? Krug suggests that if the Google Assistant, indeed any virtual assistant, is to succeed then people need to have the same attachment with it that they do to their phones. To do this, Google Home needs “to provide a truly rich and varied user experience, which means becoming the control point for everything and every service used in the home. This includes compatibility with smartphones, smart light bulbs, home security systems and even our bank accounts, as well as digital services like Spotify, Uber and Netflix.” “We are only at the beginning of this evolution, but organisations of every description will be scrambling to create dedicated apps in the hope that virtual assistants do become the next big thing, and that they can ride that wave.”   Nominations are now open for the Tech Leaders Awards 2017, the UK’s flagship celebration of the business, IT and digital leaders driving disruptive innovation and demonstrating value from the application of technology in businesses and organisations.
