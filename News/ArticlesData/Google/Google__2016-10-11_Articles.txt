The most well known and undeniably expensive examples out there are the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Those are full on virtual reality solutions that require a hefty computer to make use of but did you know that the smartphone you have in your pocket can also be converted into a virtual reality viewer? All it needs is an accessory like the Homido VR Headset and a little bit of software and you’re ready to experience 3D on the go without the need for a fancy computer or tangled up cables. The Homido VR Headset is basically a container for your smartphone not unlike what Google Cardboard or Samsung Gear VR is. While it costs more than the free Google Cardboard solution, it is much better made and actually looks like a VR unit. What you’re really getting here is a very well made, plastic Google Cardboard like device that doesn’t need to be constructed and you won’t ever have to worry about accidentally breaking it or having your phone slip out of it. This is a heavy duty piece of kit here that improves upon the standard Google Cardboard experience in every way. It even has straps on it like the Google Gear VR units, it just doesn’t have all the extra sensors. Not only that, you’re device is kept secure using some rather nice adjustable brackets and magnets to keep everything in place. Another difference is the inclusion of adjustable knobs that should allow anyone one use the Homido VR Headset comfortably. You can adjust the distance between the two lenses as well as the distance of the lenses from your eyes. Even people with glasses can use this. The headset also allows for different sized smartphones, anywhere from smaller a 4” screen to a larger 5,7” inch screen device. An iOS device or Android deice is recommended as is a quad-core device with an accelerometer and, gyroscope. There’s even a button on the headset that lets you make taps on your screen when pressed. Now that we got the hardware out of the way, your next step to enjoying the Homido VR Headset is to download the Homido Center app which is essentially a catalog of all the apps compatible with the headset. All you need to do now is find the app you want to use, download it, and hit play before inserting it into the Homido VR Headset. Usage of the Homido VR Headset is very similar to that of Google Cardboard, but you have full use of your hands because you don’t need to hold this up to your face. That means if need be, you’ll be able to use this with a Bluetooth gaming controller if the app you’re using requires it. With that said, the Homido VR Headset is a pretty good introduction for those who are curious about VR but don’t want to quite spend hundreds of dollars on the more advanced units yet. The Homido VR Headset will give you a taste of what you can do with VR at a very affordable entry price if you want a device that is made out of something more durable than cardboard.

Other than Amazon and Google, here are some other digital assistants on the market for both home and away. Samsung The South Korean electronics giant may be under fire for its faulty Note 7s, but it’s hard at work to push for new tech, including purchasing the US start-up Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple’s Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort to provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Apple’s next challenge is to make Siri smarter as it plays catch-up with rivals’ artificial intelligence Samsung is the world’s leading maker of smartphones powered by Google’s Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Microsoft Microsoft’s personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana – a name based on a character in its blockbuster game Halo – responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook Heavily investing in artificial intelligence, this social media platform is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the code name “M”. Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of “Jarvis”, the assistant of Tony Stark from the Marvel cinematic universe. For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered “bots” on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft [a competitor of Uber in the US] or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a stand-alone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home.

With the roll out having already commenced on Wednesday, October 12 when users initiate a search on their mobile devices (smartphones to be precise) in the search results they will see compatible pages with a ‘lightning’ symbol next to them. If the user clicks on that particular link, he/she will be routed to a webpage that is comparatively much less bloated and takes a lot less time to load. The webpage will mostly contain textual content with relatively few images and ads to offer a distraction-free viewing experience to users all the while consuming much less data. Google started rolling out AMP to the Top Stories carousel in mobile search results as early as February this year, but it was only limited to news stories. It is worth noting that Google did not extend AMP to all supported pages (not just news content) in mobile search results until September. This support for non-news AMP results is now rolling out to India. For those of you who are still not aware about AMP project – it is an open source initiative by Google geared towards addressing the issue of slow site load issues that has plagued the internet ever since multimedia content made its way to the webpages. Google believes that slow loading websites are one of the most annoying aspects of the Internet with data indicating that as many as 53 per cent of Internet users leaving a website that fails to load in three seconds or less. Google has been testing out AMP since a year now and currently the search engine giant is celebrating AMP’s first anniversary. The key feature about AMP is that it shows a rather bare-bone version of the page that the user is accessing and because of absence of those fancy multimedia animations and multiple frames, the page loads much faster and saves ample amount of mobile data.

Difference between revisions of "Socorro/GoogleAuth" From MozillaWiki < Socorro Jump to: navigation, search Revision as of 14:57, 12 October 2016 (view source) Willkg (Talk | contribs) (first pass on google auth stuff) Newer edit → (No difference) Revision as of 14:57, 12 October 2016 Contents 1 Summary 2 FAQ 2.1 Why Google auth and not other-thing? 2.2 Can't be logged into Socorro and other Google properties with two different accounts Summary For Bug 1273032, we transitioned from Persona to Google auth. This work was done over the course of 2016 alongside many other Mozilla sites and in consultation with the Persona team. This wiki page roughly covers why we picked Google auth and also common questions. FAQ Why Google auth and not other-thing? There are a lot of auth systems out there. Socorro contains crash data which contains personally identifiable information of our users. We care extreme pains to make sure this data is safe and secure. Because of that, Socorro has requirements that go above and beyond those of other Mozilla sites. One of those requirements is that our auth system needs to be LDAP backed such that we can revoke access to people when they leave the Mozillaverse. Another requirement is that non-employees can log in. Persona was great for this. Now that Persona is going away, we were pretty limited with our options and settled on Google auth. This comment covers the reasoning: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1273032#c2 Are we thrilled about this situation? No. Does it have downsides? Yes. It's the best we can do at this time. When will we revisit this decision? If a compelling solution that meets our needs comes up that other Mozilla sites with similar needs have switched to, we'll revisit the decision. Can't be logged into Socorro and other Google properties with two different accounts Google auth is used for Google mail and other Google properties. Because of that, if you're logged into Socorro with one identity, you can't use a different identity with other Google in the same browser. There isn't anything we can do about this. Some ways around this: Use two different browsers. Maybe log into Google properties with one browser and Socorro with a different one? Use two different profiles. Launch two separate instances of Firefox with two different profiles? Use Firefox Nightly which has contextual identity tabs.

Google’s Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. had at the end of last year a total of 74,505 employees, about one-third fewer than Microsoft Corp. even though their combined stock-market value is twice as big. Photo-sharing service Instagram had 13 employees when it was acquired for $1 billion by Facebook in 2012. Hiring in the computer and chip sectors dove after companies shifted hardware production outside the U.S., and the newest tech giants needed relatively few workers. The number of technology startups fizzled. Growth in productivity and wages slowed, and income inequality rose as machines replaced routine, low- and middle-income, human-powered work. This outcome is a far cry from what many political leaders, tech entrepreneurs and economists predicted about a generation ago. In 2000, President Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address: “America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology.” His economic team trumpeted “the ferment of rapid technological change” as one of the U.S. economy’s “principal engines” of growth. The gap between what the tech boom promised and then delivered is another source of the rumbling national discontent that powered the rise this year of political outsiders Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. The tech-powered disappointment is subtler than the anger caused by the crushing impact of China’s import invasion and the perceived failures of government institutions like the Federal Reserve in guiding the economy. Instead, it stems from the idea that Americans expected larger economic gains from these amazing new machines and the companies that created them, not a widening between the haves and have-nots. “There is a growing sense of frustration that people haven’t seen the progress that their parents and grandparents did,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose work has chronicled how technology widens the income gap between rich and poor. “That frustration spills into the political arena.” In 1997, Time magazine named computer-chip maker Intel Corp.’s chief executive, Andrew S. Grove, who died in March 2016, as “Man of the Year.” Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos won in 1999. Companies spent billions of dollars reprogramming their computers for the Year 2000 bug, and profitless dot-com startups won giant valuations from optimistic investors.© David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News The bursting of the dot-com bubble in early 2000, the recession in 2001 and deepening globalization proved to be turning points for the tech economy and its broader impact on American prosperity. U.S. tech companies accelerated the reshuffling of their supply networks to China and elsewhere in Asia, places filled with growth potential and cheap labor. Hardware makers concentrated production overseas to supply U.S. and foreign computer makers. After rising through the 1990s, total employment at computer and electronic firms in the U.S. sank to 1.03 million in August 2016 from 1.87 million in 2001, according to Labor Department statistics. Employment at semiconductor makers fell by half to 359,000 in the same period. In the 1990s, Micron Technology Inc. was a successful example of how far the tech industry reached beyond its nexus in Silicon Valley. Based in Boise, Idaho, Micron was founded by Idaho farmers and businessmen, including the late billionaire J.R. Simplot, who supplied McDonald’s Corp. with most of its frozen french fries and had “MR SPUD” license plates on his pickup truck. Micron’s workforce quadrupled to 18,800 between 1994 and 2000, with the growth overwhelmingly in the U.S. The company fought with Japan in the 1980s to restrict imported memory chips and protect its U.S. base. These days, Micron is a case study in how technology companies have exported jobs to other countries. As of 2013, the most recently disclosed data, Micron had 11,300 workers in the U.S., down from 14,000 in 2000. The company’s non-U.S. workforce surged to 19,600, mainly in China and other Asian nations, from 4,800. Securities filings show that the percentage of employees at Micron who were in the U.S. shrank to 37% from 74% in the same period. The company stopped disclosing the annual percentage in 2014. A Micron spokesman says much of the growth outside the U.S. came from acquisitions. “What we’re doing is replacing more resources there to support the growing customer base—both the multinationals that are leveraging the low labor-cost areas in China, in particular, as well as the indigenous Chinese manufacturers,” Mike Sadler, Micron’s head of sales, told analysts in 2014. He is now Micron’s strategic chief. The Semiconductor Industry Association says semiconductors remain a big U.S. business and are America’s third-largest export, trailing cars and aircraft. Apple Inc. followed a similar path. Co-founder Steve Jobs made it a mission early in his Apple career and after creating NeXT Inc., another computer maker, to revitalize U.S. manufacturing. Macintosh computers rolled off the line at an Apple factory “like a Holiday Inn toaster turns out toasted bagels,” says Brent Schlender, who co-wrote a biography of Mr. Jobs. By the time Mr. Jobs died in 2011, Apple made nearly every one of its products outside America, largely in Asia. Apple halted U.S. manufacturing in 2004 and didn’t resume until 2013, when it began producing Mac Pro personal computers in Austin, Texas. Apple says it employs about 80,000 workers in the U.S., or two-thirds of the company’s overall workforce. About half the U.S. employees have retail jobs. An Apple spokeswoman says it is “creating jobs in new industries like the App Economy,” or apps developed for the iPhone, and is “a major contributor to U.S. manufacturing” by buying American-made components and materials. Mr. Schlender, the Jobs biographer, says it made sense to assemble the iPod outside the U.S. when production began in 2001. “The components were hard to make, and putting them together was a labor-intensive job because everything was so small,” he says. “You had to piece it together by hand.” The computer-hardware exodus spread. International Business Machines Corp., the company that turned computers into a big business, was born in Endicott, N.Y., and built its first factories there. From 2001 to 2015, though, employment in computer and electronics manufacturing in surrounding Broome County fell about two-thirds to 3,055 jobs. Warehouses and transportation companies scooped up some laid-off workers at salaries of less than half those paid in high-tech manufacturing, says Christian Harris, an analyst for the New York State Department of Labor. American tech workers are getting a smaller piece of the economic pie created from what they produce. As of 2014, employee compensation in computer and electronic-parts making was equal to 49% of the value of the industry’s output, down from 79% in 1999, according to the Commerce Department. While other tech jobs have been created in sectors such as software publishing, that growth is smaller than the losses in tech manufacturing. Since 2002, the number of technology startups has slowed, hurting job creation. In a 2014 study, economists Javier Miranda, John Haltiwanger and Ian Hathaway said the growth of tech startups accelerated to 113,000 in 2001 from 64,000 in 1992. That number slumped to 79,000 in 2011 and hasn’t recovered, according to the economists’ calculations using updated data. The causes include global competition and increased domestic regulation, says Mr. Haltiwanger, an economics professor at the University of Maryland. Another problem is that fewer tech companies have gone public, which can enrich early employees and spawn more jobs as companies grow. Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business, says there were 548 initial public offerings of technology-related companies from 2001 to 2015. From 1990 to 2000, by contrast, 1,853 went public. The latest generation of hot tech startups has attracted a mountain of venture-capital funding and gigantic valuations, led by Uber Technologies Inc., which was worth $68 billion as of June. The influx of wealth has created more prosperity in Silicon Valley but exemplifies the economic polarization rippling through America. WhatsApp had more than 450 million users world-wide when Facebook bought the messaging service for $19 billion in 2014, turning founder Jan Koum into a billionaire several times over. At the time of the acquisition, WhatsApp had 55 employees. Economists call the phenomenon “skill-biased technical change.” The spoils of growth go to those few people with skills and luck and who are best positioned to take advantage of new technology. The five largest U.S.-based technology companies by stock-market value—Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Oracle Corp.—are worth a combined $1.8 trillion today. That is 80% more than the five largest tech companies in 2000. Today’s five giants have 22% fewer workers than their predecessors, or a total of 434,505 as of last year, compared with 556,523 at Cisco Systems Inc., Intel, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft in 2000. Amazon uses 45,000 small robots at about one-third of its U.S. warehouses to automate order processing. The robots look like bread boxes on wheels, lifting modular shelves stuffed with products and carrying the shelves to workers who pick out pieces. An Amazon spokesman says the company has added about 200,000 employees since it began using the robots in early 2012. Amazon has 268,000 employees world-wide. Robots aren’t dexterous enough yet to identify different sized-packages, pick the right ones and place them safely in boxes, says Mr. Brynjolfsson, the MIT economist. That is the fundamental skill in warehousing. Researchers now are trying to automate that part of the job, too. In coming decades, machines are likely to replace new forms of routine work done by humans. From 1991 to 2001, the number of secretaries declined about 35%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of textile and apparel workers fell 37%. For a long time, those with bachelor’s degrees in science seemed to be safe from automation-related layoffs because their cognitive knowledge was tough for computers to duplicate. Less-educated workers who dispense personal service, such as home health aides or masseuses, also seemed safe. Harvard University economist David Deming estimates that the hollowing-out of work spread to programmers, librarians and engineers between 2000 and 2012. As much as $2 trillion worth of human economic activity could be automated away using existing technologies, such as Amazon’s robots, in coming years, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates. Knightscope Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., makes robots that serve as night watchmen. About three dozen are on patrol, including at shopping malls, corporate campuses such as Microsoft’s in Mountain View and the new home arena of the Sacramento Kings. Knightscope clients pay $7 an hour per robot. “Robots don’t complain,” says Stacy Stephens, a Knightscope co-founder and vice president of marketing and sales. “There’s no pension. And there’s no worker’s comp,” he adds.

Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize your pictures and video, and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (3) New York • If you're like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you've posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning" to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: ——— APPLE'S MEMORIES Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple's app created a "Florida to Illinois" package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a "Together" package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an "At The Beach" package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related." You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. ——— GOOGLE'S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical "GIF" animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. » Next page...

The magazine, which recently threw in the towel on nudity as part of an effort to reach a broader audience, made its debut on the iTunes and Google Play stores. “Since introducing a brand new vision for Playboy magazine earlier this year, we have expanded our distribution channels in many powerful ways, including higher visibility on an increased number of traditional and digital media platforms,” said David Israel, chief operating officer and chief financial officer of Playboy Enterprises. “Inclusion in the iTunes and Google Play stores is an important milestone for Playboy as we continue to explore opportunities to introduce our content to new audiences all over the world.” Playboy, which broke lifestyle taboos in the 1950s with bare-breasted pictures in a magazine for the mass market, unveiled “a top-to-bottom redesign” starting with its March 2016 edition. Facing a deluge of online pornography, Playboy shifted its focus in a bid to offer lifestyle content that is “safe for work” and more widely distributed on social media. Playboy still includes provocative pictorials of women, but without nudity, a major turnabout for the magazine which launched in 1953 with an edition featuring Marilyn Monroe. The magazine also gained fame for its interviews of major public figures from Jimmy Carter to Fidel Castro, and fiction from writers including Vladimir Nabokov, Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week The dingo’s got my baby: The case of Lindy Chamberlain 10 stories you’ll need to read with the light on Singapore library offers reading on the go for selected titles via new app Here’s why reading fiction may be good for you Love plot twists?

Think again. Sure, it might not be the exact equivalent of flying to Europe and walking down the Champs-Élysées, but thanks to Google, you might be able to experience an acceptable alternative. It’s all thanks to Curio-cité from Google Arts & Culture, a new initiative that the tech giant calls a fresh way to rediscover our cities. Related: This Android hack brings Google Assistant to your non-Pixel smartphone With Curio-cité, you can virtually follow guides, artists, and experts on a tour of Paris like you’ve never seen it before (even if you have been to the City of Light in real life). The first episode of the new interactive tour invites viewers to visit 10 “different hidden corners,” including the mysterious “underground lake” of the Palais Garnier opera house, which served as inspiration for the classic book and Broadway show “Phantom of the Opera.” You can meander down the Petite Ceinture, the seemingly forgotten railway that once encircled Paris, or explore the largest collective exhibition of street art in history at the Tour Paris 13. Google also offers the companionship of urban explorer and photographer David de Rueda, with whom you can take a 360-degree immersive tour of the historic Papeteries de la Seine, a recently closed paper mill. Available for free on the web, iOS and Android, you can also experience Curio-cité in all its glory if you own a Google Cardboard. And while Paris is the subject of the first episode, Google definitely isn’t closing the door on exploring more destinations around the world. “Who knows,” the company said, “Maybe we’ll meet up again in a few months to explore a different city…” So if you’re a bit over budget on vacations this year but still want to go globetrotting, just sit down in front of your computer (or with your smartphone), pour yourself some champagne, and check out Curio-cité.

In our trove of data this time around are Google's smartphones, virtual reality headset, smart speaker and updated Chromecast. As always, these are not reviews. The ratings, meanwhile, reflect just how much I'd like to try out each item, even if they do relatively little to advance the lethargic smartphone market. Pixel Almost-Perfect The first smartphones Google has made by itself, Pixel and Pixel XL, are the first to bear Android 7.1 and the first to have the impressive Google Assistant built in. The Pixel has a 5-inch HD screen, while the Pixel XL offers a 5.5-inch QHD display. The phones have a quad-core processor and 4 GB of RAM. I like that the fingerprint sensor is on the back -- that would nullify the awkward fidgeting I deal with every time my iPhone fails to recognize my thumbprint -- and the inclusion of an analog headphone jack is extremely welcome in the wake of the kerfuffle over Apple's decision to ditch it. The iPhone 7 does have one audio advantage, with stereo speakers to Pixel's single speaker. I appreciate Google's ability to house the 12.3-megapixel camera entirely within the phone's body, avoiding a lens protruding from the back. Even better is the unlimited, full-resolution photo and video storage Google is offering Pixel owners. There's a lot to admire about these phones, but I can't seem to muster up any real excitement for them. They seem perfectly acceptable top-of-the-line smartphones with welcome features -- yet there's little that seems truly innovative or remarkable. Pixel and Pixel XL are good first steps for Google's in-house smartphone division. I can only hope the next stage is more of a giant leap. Rating: 4 out of 5 Millions of Photos Softer VR Google also has its own virtual-reality headset, Daydream VR. It works much like the Samsung Gear VR, or even Google's own Cardboard, in that you slide a compatible smartphone (such as Pixel) into the front of the visor and strap the thing to your head. The headset automatically pairs with the phone using the handset's NFC chip. Where Daydream VR has a big advantage, at least from my perspective, is in the soft material build that accommodates eyeglass wearers. I find Oculus Rift exceedingly uncomfortable while wearing my spectacles, so thanks for that, Google. Along with physical buttons, the controller has motion detection, which I'm sure will come in useful for gaming. As for content, you'll be able to step into real-world locations using Google Street View and look around YouTube's 360-degree videos. Netflix, Hulu and HBO apps will work with the platform too. As with Gear VR, this is a low-cost way for people to start experimenting with virtual reality. I like the design of this system, but the platform's future will hinge on content and how successful Google is in recruiting developers and partners to take advantage of Daydream VR. Rating: 4 out of 5 Whole New Worlds No Voice Like Home Google's smart speaker, Google Home, is not all that different on the surface from Amazon Echo, save for being US$50 cheaper and being deeper ingrained into Google's services instead of Amazon's. I like that it works with Chromecast, so I could ask Home to play something on my TV instantly (YouTube-only now for video, but more services are apparently on the way). On the music side, you can play from Spotify, Pandora, and others. If you get tired of using your voice, you can tap the top to pause or play music or roll your finger over it to adjust the volume. The design is simple and classy, and I like that there are swappable options for the base. Smart speakers are inherently interesting, and I certainly use Google services more than Amazon. I'm just not sure how useful Home truly would be for me, or quite how it would fit into my life. Still, if I can just bark at a box to start playing the next episode of Luke Cage, I won't complain. Rating: 4 out of 5 Simple Orders Chromecast Powers Up Chromecast Ultra streams video in 4K resolution, strangely enough. For those of us without a 4K-ready television, it's apparently faster than previous models, thanks to stronger WiFi connectivity, and there's a welcome Ethernet port to boot. It's an iterative change, rather than a revolutionary one, which makes sense. There seems little reason for Google to reinvent the wheel when Chromecast is such a runaway success. Roku just updated its line of players, and the entry-level cost of those devices is far lower than Chromecast Ultra's $69 retail price. However, such is the ease of use of Chromecast that I doubt Google will cede much of its business to Roku. This latest version is bound to be just as solid as previous incarnations.

With iOS 10, the Photos app has more options for searching and viewing highlights. Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party.  Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood.

The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called 'Rediscover this day.' Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you'll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. According to the firm, Google's AI can now describe images with nearly 94 percent accuracy and may even ‘understand’ the context and deeper meaning of a scene. The AI was first trained in 2014, and has steadily improved in the time since SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos.  MICROSOFT'S CAPTION BOT GETS IT HILARIOUSLY WRONG  Microsoft's CaptionBot, which analyzes pictures in order to formulate captions, has been spot on with some results, but horridly wrong for others – it thought the First Lady Michelle Obama was a cell phone. When it was released to the public earlier this year, the program seemed to be accurate with almost all of the images it received. Microsoft's CaptionBot, which analyzes pictures in order to formulate captions, has been spot on with some results, but horridly wrong for others But recently, it mistook an elbow as a woman brushing her teeth and a close up of a human eye as a close up of a doughnut near a cup. 'It's early days for image captioning,' a Microsoft spokesperson told Dailymail in April. 'Like any artificial intelligence system, we use feedback from users of CaptionBot to improve our results and make it more accurate.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 11 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive..

Verizon told Ars: First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google. Also, the Verizon version of the Google Pixel is carrier unlocked, so you can use it where ever you like. Finally, we have three apps pre-installed on the phone Go90, My Verizon (which is your account management tool) and Verizon Messages (your messaging app). As you noted, all three can easily be uninstalled by the user. Google further confirmed that that updates will not be held back by Verizon. Google told Ars: OS updates and monthly security patches will be updated on all Pixel devices (Verizon and non-Verizon versions) simultaneously. That's excellent news.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Web / Internet Life > Web resources FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Chrome 54 Released with Support for Custom HTML Tags GO New features included with Chrome for Android as well Oct 12, 2016 21:25 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google has released Chrome 54, the latest stable version of the Google Chrome browser, which for this version has added support for a series of features, but none more important than the Custom Elements V1 specification that allows developers to create custom HTML tags. Chrome had already been supporting custom HTML tags for some time now, but only an intermediary and unfinished version of the Custom Elements specification. Expect HTML code to become unreadable Chrome 54 now supports Custom Elements V1, a final version of this WHATWG spec, which all major browser vendors have agreed to support and implement. Currently, only Chrome 54 and Opera 41 Beta support the new Custom Elements V1 spec, while most browsers still support V0. Google said they plan to support both specification versions until most developers have moved on to V1. Custom Elements opens the door for custom HTML tags such as < softpedia > and < boaty-mcboatface >, so expect HTML code to become more unreadable in the upcoming future. BroadcastChannel support Another important feature added to Chrome 54 is BroadcastChannel, a mechanism through which multiple browser windows, tabs, iframes, web workers, and service workers can talk to each other. This feature is strictly aimed at developers and will allow them to create web services that can sync data between multiple windows and tabs for the same origin URL, much more easily and without the need of complicated async JavaScript code. Ok... we're wrong, maybe you still need complicated async JavaScript code, but it won't be as complicated as before. Chrome for Android improvements Besides the desktop editors, Google devs have added new features for the browser's Android edition, which can now replicate a feature found in the official YouTube app. Chrome 54 ships with a function called Element.requestFullScreen(), which website developers can use to automatically move video content in fullscreen mode when the phone's orientation changes, like going from portrait to landscape. Additionally, v54 has also improved the Page Visibility API to allow videos to play as the user scrolls down the page. This behavior is already present in most desktop browsers, but was never included in the Chrome Android version in order to save smartphone resources. Play Video Users can update Chrome using the built-in update tool, or they can download a fresh copy from Google's site or one of the Softpedia download mirrors for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Below are the security fixes included in Chrome 54. After them, we have included a summary of other features Google added in Chrome 54, modifications, and deprecations.

The Pacific Light Cable Network will stretch 12,800 kilometers (8,000 miles), crossing beneath the Pacific Ocean in a first-of-its-kind direct connection between the two locations, according to companies involved with the project. PLCN is expected to handle some 120 terabytes of data per second, enough capacity to enable 80 million high-definition video conference calls simultaneously between Los Angeles and Hong Kong, said Google network infrastructure director Brian Quigley. Google and Facebook are working with Pacific Light Data Communication Company and with undersea communications technology firm TE SubCom on the cable, which was scheduled to be ready in mid 2018, according to a joint release. "PLCN will be among the lowest-latency fiber optic routes between Hong Kong and the US and the first to connect directly using ultra-high-capacity transmission," PLDC chairman Wei Junkang said. "It is certainly gratifying that global technology companies like Google and Facebook have become co-investors in PLCN." Most Pacific subsea cables stretch from the US to Japan, according to Facebook vice president of network engineering Najam Ahmad. "As the number of people using Facebook apps and services continues to grow in the region, PLCN will help further connect Asia and our data centers in the US," Ahmad said. "This new direct route will give us more diversity and resiliency in the Pacific." - Cables to Clouds - Lifestyles increasingly centered on access to cloud-based online services as well as to video, pictures and other content on the internet have increased the need for infrastructure capable of quickly and efficiently moving digital data. PLCN will be the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake, according to Quigley. The US internet giant claimed to have the "largest network backbone of any public cloud provider." Microsoft and Facebook early this year teamed together to lay a high-speed Internet cable across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The subsea "MAREA" cable was expected to be completed by late 2017, with the aim of meeting growing demand by the tech companies' customers for fast, reliable data connections. MAREA was expected to have a capacity of some 160 terabytes per second of data, according to the companies. The 6,600 kilometer cable system will also be the first connecting the United States and southern Europe, running from Northern Virginia to Bilbao, Spain, Microsoft and Facebook said.

The 44,943 requests amounted to a 10 percent increase from the prior six-month period and a fourth consecutive increase, Google said in its "transparency report." The official requests related to 76,713 user accounts in the latest period, down from 81,311 in the second half of 2015. Google provided at least some data in response to 64 percent of the requests in 2016, unchanged from the previous reporting period. The number of requests to Google has been generally rising since it began releasing transparency data in 2011. The online giant, like other tech firms, maintains that it protects user privacy while cooperating with lawful requests from police and other official agencies. "As we have noted in the past, when we receive a request for user information, we review it carefully and only provide information within the scope and authority of the request," Google law enforcement director Richard Salgado said in a blog post. "Before producing data in response to a government request, we make sure it strictly follows the law, for example to compel us to disclose content in criminal cases we require the government use a search warrant, and that it complies with Google's strict policies (to prevent overreach that can compromise users' privacy)." In the latest report, the United States had the largest number of requests at 14,169, with data supplied in 79 percent of those cases. Germany was second with 8,788 requests, followed by France (4,300), India (3,452) and Britain (3,302). The company said it received its first-ever requests from Algeria, Belarus, the Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Fiji and Saudi Arabia in 2016.

And so, in turn, lots of people rely on the company’s own online monetization tool, AdSense, whose website just got a Material Design coat of paint… People probably don’t use AdSense to feast their eyes on it, but it’s nonetheless nice to see Google’s visual language — which launched over two years ago at this point — take over the entirety of Google-related apps and services. If anything, it’s a testament to consistency, something Google has not historically been known for. So what changes? Well, for one the website is now much more pleasant to look at, with the anonymous grey replaced by a vibrant and yet sufficiently unobtrusive blue. In the home page, it helps to immediately identify both the “Estimated earnings” card as well as the one containing your balance, while all the other information is relegated to the cards below. Here’s the one UI change, though: cards can now be “pinned” (much like emails in Inbox, if you will), so to have them at the top of your feed, and you can even rearrange them in the layout you prefer. Google also implemented the Material hamburger menu, which intelligently understands the size of your browser’s window and keeps itself open or closed accordingly. There are also nice Material Design animations all throughout the website, which obviously help making the overall look and feel infinitely better. As someone who, for a reason or another, constantly checks AdSense, this is indeed a nice change; unfortunately, as of now, it doesn’t look like there’s a manual way to switch over to the revamped website; a prompt will manifest itself, and there is an option to revert back to the old version at will. Do you use AdSense? Have you received the updated version, and do you like it so far? Let us know.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (10) Post your comment Google app for Android adds a small transparent widget under the search bar 12 October 2016 Google is currently in the process of adding a new feature to its eponymous app for Android. Simply put, it's a new widget that shows up under the big white persistent search bar in your launcher. The widget is transparent and can show you small tidbits of information, such as the weather at your location, commute time, or local information. Above is the way it looks. The screenshots below will help guide you in order to enable it. Go to the Google app's settings and then choose Widget, and turn it on. Note that as with all things Google-related, this one's part of a staged rollout too, so you may not even see the Widget option yet. Oh, and even if you do, and you enable it, the widget itself might now show up immediately - or at all. The functionality probably requires a server-side switch too, and Google seems to be taking its time in doing that for all users. One thing to note is that you are apparently required to have the Google app version 6.6.14.21 or later in order for this to work - and to get that you may have to register as a beta tester for the app (you can do that from its Play Store listing, but the usual warnings about running beta software on your daily driver apply). One final note: the new widget might not be shown at all times, even after everything is enabled for you (including that server-side switch). Hopefully this will change in the future, and it will gain support for more Google Now cards.

(Photo by Rainier Ehrhardt/Getty Images) Asia-Pacific, Cloud Computing, Connectivity, Facebook, Google, Los Angeles Facebook and Google to Build Transpacific Submarine Cable by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on October 12, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet Facebook has partnered with Google to pay for construction of what will be one of the highest-capacity submarine cable systems stretching across the Pacific Ocean, connecting Los Angeles to Hong Kong. This is a second such partnership Facebook has gotten involved in and yet another example of changes happening in the submarine cable industry, which has traditionally been dominated by consortia of private and government-owned carriers. Operators of mega-scale data centers who deliver internet services to people around the world – companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon – have reached a point where their global bandwidth needs are so high, it makes more sense for them to fund cable construction projects directly than to buy capacity from carriers. In May, Facebook announced it had teamed up with Microsoft on a submarine cable across the Atlantic, linking landing stations in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Bilbao, Spain. The future transatlantic system, called MAREA, will be operated by Telefonica. Both Europe and Asia Pacific are important markets for the internet and cloud services giants. The Los Angeles-Hong Kong cable will help improve connectivity between both companies’ data centers in the US and Asia. Map courtesy of Facebook The cable will be called Pacific Light Cable Network, taking its name from the third partner on the project: Pacific Light Data Communications. See also: Transpacific Data Center Connectivity Hub Launches in Seattle Both MAREA and PLCN systems will be built by TE SubCom, one of the biggest names in the submarine cable industry. In addition to simply increasing the amount of bandwidth between the US and Asia, the 120Tbps PLCN system will provide greater diversity in transpacific cable routes, Najam Ahmad, director of technical operations at Facebook, wrote in a blog post announcing the project. “Most Pacific subsea cables go from the United States to Japan, and this new direct route will give us more diversity and resiliency in the Pacific,” he explained. The FASTER cable system, backed by Google and several Asian telecommunications and IT services companies, came online earlier this year. Another big submarine cable project is the New Cross Pacific Cable System, which is backed by Microsoft and a group of Asian telcos. NCP is expected to come online in 2017. Both will land in Oregon on the US side. Also this year, Amazon Web Services made its first investment in a submarine cable project, agreeing to become the fourth anchor customer necessary to make the planned Hawaiki Submarine Cable between the US, Australia, and New Zealand possible. One big way in which PLCN and MAREA will be different from traditional transoceanic cable systems is they will be interoperable with a variety of network equipment, rather than being designed to work with a specific set of landing-station technologies, according to Ahmad. Not only will each user be able to choose what optical equipment fits their needs best, they will be able to upgrade that equipment as better technology becomes available. “This means equipment refreshes can occur as optical technology improves, including taking advantage of advances made during the construction of the system,” he wrote. “When equipment can be replaced by better technology at a quicker pace, costs should go down and bandwidth rates should increase more quickly.” See also: Data Center Connectivity: Dare to Bypass New York Previous Article ServerHub Announces New Amsterdam Location at HostingCon Europe Next Article KKR Said to Write Off First Brazil Deal Amid Aceco Legal Battles Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Roston - Oct 12, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you’ve ordered your Google Pixel XL, it’s time to order a case, otherwise you risk your handset getting damage the first time you drop it. Pick the wrong case, though, and you may end up with a cheap, ill-fitting product or, worse, something that doesn’t protect your phone at all. Fortunately, there are numerous high-end cases for the Pixel XL already on the market, and they come at different price points with different features to meet specific needs. Here are five of the best ones among them. Clear Pixel XL Case by Google and Live Cases It’s a simple phone case, and for most Pixel XL owners, it’s the only case they’ll need. As the name suggests, the clear Pixel XL Case by Google is both clear and made by Google, the combination of which means the Pixel XL’s stylings will be visible and you can rest easy knowing it will properly fit the phone. The case costs $30 and is available via the Google Store. If the clear case isn’t to your tastes, Google is also offering Live Cases for the Pixel XL. With this option, you get to pick your own design and you’ll receive a custom case featuring the photo printed across its back. These customizable Live Cases were first announced for the Nexus phones and they’ve added support for both Pixel handsets. These cases are a little more pricey at $40/each, however. Available via the Google Store. (Note: as of Oct. 12, 2016, Google lists these cases as ‘coming soon.’) Tech21 Evo Check Pixel XL Case Tech21 is tried in true. We’ve been using Tech21 cases for multiple phones for the past several years, and they’ve never let us down. The Evo Check is the basic case from Tech21, a case that comes in multiple colors and protects the rim and the back of the phone. It’s top quality without costing an arm and a leg. FRĒ for Pixel XL Case Lifeproof’s FRĒ phone case for the Pixel XL is quite a bit more expensive than most phone cases at $89.99, but it has a lot to offer, including a ‘waterproof, dirtproof, snowproof, dropproof’ design. This is the kind of case you get when you expect to take your phone on all sorts of adventures, but you don’t want to risk having to replace it any time soon. The case is available only in Asphalt Black as of now from Lifeproof’s website. OtterBox for Pixel XL It doesn’t appear Urban Armor Gear has yet launched a Pixel XL case, but if you’re looking for something suitably similar in terms of ruggedness, OtterBox has you covered. If you’re familiar with the company’s other smartphone cases, you’ll find the Pixel XL case decidedly similar. Both “Commuter Series” and “Defender Series” cases are available for the Pixel XL, the latter of which is a bit chunkier, but includes an extra layer of protection, as well as dust, scratch and drop protection. The Defender case costs $59.95 and the Commuter case costs $49.95. Case-Mate Wallet Folio for Pixel XL And finally, for those of you who like to keep your cards and phone in the same case comes Case-Mate’s Wallet Folio Case for the Pixel XL. This case is made from handcrafted leather and includes four slots for ID, credit cards and such. This case is being offered through Verizon Wireless for $59.99.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Google’s Nexus is dead, long live Pixel Google’s Nexus is dead, long live Pixel By David Cardinal on October 6, 2016 at 1:04 pm Comment Google has zigged and zagged so often in its approach to hardware that it is hard to put too much stock in a branding change based on a single product launch. But Google’s move to kill off the Nexus brand in favor of Pixel has implications beyond the launch of a new phone. This is a lot bigger change than simply rebranding its screen-based hardware (so far, tablets, Chromebooks, and phones). It signals a major shift from a developer-enabling “proof of concept” line of phones under the Nexus brand to an attempt to compete head-to-head with flagships from Microsoft, Apple, and Samsung. Perhaps the closest analog to Google’s Pixel brand is Microsoft’s Surface. Originally floated as a statement of what was possible with Windows hardware, it has evolved into a key element of Microsoft’s devices and services strategy. Similarly, since the awkward consumer launch of the original Nexus One, Nexus has not been seriously promoted as a mass market product line by Google –although the phones’ attractive pricing and clean software made them popular with plenty of non-developers. But now, Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL are clearly designed to compete directly with the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy 7 families of phones. This is reflected in the Pixel’s premium pricing. Unlike the Nexus phones, the Pixels are definitely not a bargain. Ranging in price from $650 to $870, they’re not going to be purchased based on low price. Google is on thinner ice with Pixel now The danger for Google as it tries to make Pixel a compelling value and a marketplace winner is that it will damage its Android ecosystem by giving itself, and its Pixels, what its partners perceive as unfair advantages. Google has already given the Pixel phones first crack at Android 7.1, and an exclusive on its much-touted Google Assistant for now. That’s in addition to the natural advantages it will have because Google is doing so much of the hardware design and the software — like the uniquely-powerful version of HDR+ in the camera, and gyroscopically coupled image stabilization (not unique to the Pixel, but tricky to pull off). Amazon has long since forked its version of Android, but now Samsung is becoming increasingly open about the possibility of using Tizen instead of Google’s Android on more of its devices. Samsung could probably only make that work by shipping a version of Tizen that runs most Android apps — but it wouldn’t be automatically tied into Google’s Play services and data collection framework. Pixel is also potential insurance on Google’s part against the possibility of Samsung moving away from Google’s version of Android, and no doubt a negotiating chip it can use with Samsung and others to help keep its ecosystem moving forward. Google may push things further by producing some of its own silicon for future versions of the Pixel. So, does Google really mean it this time? Google doesn’t have a great track record in consumer hardware. Other than the popular Chromecast, most of it has either targeted niche markets — like the Nexus phones for developers — or has had limited success (or even failed before launch, like the Nexus Q). That doesn’t even count the odd purchase and subsequent sale of Motorola’s phone business after a very poor showing. This time, though, Google is clearly much more intent on making its mark, at least in smart home devices. It is a much more open question whether the Pixel brand — Google’s third try at the mass market for phones — will be a success with consumers.

Newsletter Signup WebProNews Navigation Categories Advertising Business Developer eCommerce Search Social Media Tech All Search Categories Advertising Business Developer eCommerce Search Social Media Tech All Search Google Buys FameBit, Sees Branded Content as Essential to YouTube Rich Ord10.12.2016Advertising Share this Post Google has purchased FameBit, a technology and marketing platform that helps brands link up with social media stars on YouTube and Twitter. This is part of a growing trend where Google and others realize that preroll video ads are not the future and that marketing integration into content is the smart way to reach millennial's and even younger audiences. Ironically, that's how television started in the 1950's, where every show was brought to you by a product and often that product was integrated into the content. "We believe that Google’s relationship with brands and YouTube’s partnerships with creators, combined with FameBit’s technology and expertise, will help increase the number of branded content opportunities available, bringing even more revenue into the online video community," noted Ariel Bardin, Vice President, Product Management at Google. FameBit provides a modern version of this, telling marketers that it will grow your customer base via tutorials, comedic skits, mentions, routines, DIY videos, game plays, lookbooks, vlogs and hauls. What this means is that FameBit, and now YouTube, will connect your brand with YouTube stars and help popular YouTuber's make additional revenue in the process. "Every year, more and more brands are making YouTube essential to their marketing strategy," said Bardin. "In fact, in the last year alone, the top 100 advertisers have increased their spend on YouTube video ads by 50 percent." Google knows that even though brands have increased their marketing on YouTube, what they really want are deeper connections with YouTube stars and through extension their fans. "As brands continue to embrace the value of YouTube, they’re also taking their investments one step further, partnering with creators on branded content opportunities such as product placements, promotions and sponsorships," he said. "As we look to the future, we want even more creators and brands to come together and realize the benefits of these creative collaborations." Unlike Google search, YouTube video is not inherently a lead generation opportunity, but rather is more like TV, promoting brand recognition and brand favorability. Fortunately for Google, that's what Madison Avenue sells and Google wants to tap into more of their dollars. According to eMarketer TV ad spending will be $72.01 billion in 2016 with digital ad spending just slightly under that. But with advertising in video formats from YouTube, Facebook, SnapChat, Twitter, etc..., digital ad spend will increase as a percentage. By 2020, it's predicted that digital ad revenue will be 37% higher than TV. Of course, digital delivery of TV is also on the rise, replacing the cable middlemen and ultimately making digital the primary way to consume video content.

Home News Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones Verizon Pixel phones will update same time as Google Google adopting Apple update model, Pixel devices will update same time everywhere By: Sean Ridgeley | Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones News | Posted: Oct 12, 2016 8:05 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Last week we reported Pixel phones bought through Google partner Verizon would receive updates through Verizon, with the assumption they'd be late as is typically the case. Verizon however has assured that updates will occur simultaneously.     "All operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates)," a spokesperson for the company said. "Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google."   Verizon also notes their version is carrier unlocked and sports just three pre-installed apps, all of which are easily uninstalled.   Meanwhile, Google states that "OS updates and monthly security patches will be updated on all Pixel devices (Verizon and non-Verizon versions) simultaneously." In other words, Google is adopting the Apple model, and so you finally don't have to worry about horribly delayed updates, regardless of where you buy Pixel.   Doesn't get much more consumer friendly than that.

So why is Google lying? We have an idea. The Google Pixel is "only on Verizon." That is a flat-out, dirty, no-account lie. You can buy a Pixel that works with any major US carrier and many minor ones, directly from the Google Store. And yet "only on Verizon" is the line that ends every ad in Google's current $3.2 million ad blitz for its upcoming Pixel phones. It shows that, as I expected, Google is still walking the tightrope of trying not to annoy its many Android licensees by preventing itself from selling as many Pixels as it could. I've written columns before on Google's incentives not to sell phones. Android rules the world, and Google likes it that way. It makes its money through eyeballs and data collection, not through hardware sales. If Google sells too many phones, though, major partners like Samsung and Huawei may get skittish and decide to run with their own operating systems, or their own forks of Android that don't include Google services. So Google restricts sales without saying it's doing so, through soft means like weakly marketing its phones, or making it look like its phones are compatible with fewer carriers than they're really compatible with. That way, some Pixels get out there, and the technorati and developers who really want a Pixel on the carrier of their choice all get their devices, but Google doesn't rock Samsung's boat. Hi, nice to meet you. #pixel. #madebygoogle Only at @Verizon pic.twitter.com/WghM5uOiaE — Made by Google (@madebygoogle) October 4, 2016 Google even offers its own financing for Pixels. At $27.04/month, it's charging the same amount that Verizon and Best Buy are for their units. And the Google unit is superior, as it'll get its updates directly from Google without Verizon's involvement. (Verizon has said it won't interfere with updates, but it has a poor track record with that ). But you don't hear a word about Google's own finance plans in Google's marketing. //Related Articles Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7: Android Flagship Showdown T-Mobile seems to be running some sort of rear-guard action on its social media accounts to encourage people to buy real Google Pixels and hook them up to T-Mobile's network. But with 90 percent of the smartphones in the US sold carrier-locked, T-Mobile has an uphill battle if there are no Pixels in its stores. A single carrier exclusive phone hasn't been a best-seller in the US since the early heydays of the Verizon Motorola Droids and the AT&T iPhone exclusives. When you lock out two-thirds of your potential market, you cripple yourself in comparison not only to iPhones and Galaxies, but even to the LG G5 and HTC 10. The Pixel isn't actually an exclusive, but Google seems to want us to think it's one. Before you argue that Verizon demanded this language for its participation, remember that Google could have done this differently. It could have linked up with all four US carriers, or could have pushed its own sales channels. It could have gone through Best Buy or Walmart for something carrier agnostic. But instead, it decided to lie, to purposefully restrict sales, and to spread a myth that this phone is "only on Verizon." This is why Google won't become a best-selling smartphone maker on the level of Apple or Samsung. It doesn't want to be.

Matt Rourke/AP In May of last year, a woman in Florida added some Latino channels to her Comcast cable TV account. It was priced at around $10 a month. But when her bill arrived that summer, she claims, it said she owned more than $300, thanks to some equipment she never received and a Latino triple-play service that included voice service with international calling. She called customer service, but they said that they couldn’t explain how the new services were added to her bill—and that they couldn’t authorize a refund. She’d have to talk to the billing department for that. And so began a three hour stay in customer service hell that ultimately ended with her being transferred to a fax machine. This woman’s story is one of the thousands of allegations examined by the Federal Communications during its two year investigation of Comcast, and one of several cited in a settlement published by the agency on Tuesday. In the aftermath of the investigation, Comcast has agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine. That may not sound like much, but according to the FCC, it’s the largest civil penalty it has ever assessed against a cable provider. “It’s bigger than a dollar amount,” says Kate Forscey, an associate counsel for Government Affairs at the digital rights advocacy group Public Knowledge. “It’s the agency taking a stand to protect the customers who are being grifted by the cable companies. I hope this won’t’ be a one-off.” We hope so too. The investigation highlights just how hard it is for customers to get refunds for services they never should have been charged for in the first place. And the rather low fine shows how difficult it is to actually regulate these companies. Yes and No The FCC’s rules prohibit Comcast and other companies from charging customers for services they didn’t explicitly sign-up for. In other words, just because you didn’t say “no” to a service or a piece of equipment doesn’t mean your telco can charge you for it. But according the settlement, customers were in some cases charged for services and equipment they did specifically decline. Some customers even claim Comcast reported them to collection agencies while while they were disputing their bills. The situation brings to mind the recent Wells Fargo scandal, during which employees created unauthorized accounts for customers, in some cases damaging customers’ credit ratings and collecting fees for accounts the customers didn’t even know existed. But Comcast denies any intentional wrongdoing. “We do not agree with [the FCC’s] legal theory here, and in our view, after two years, it is telling that it found no problematic policy or intentional wrongdoing, but just isolated errors or customer confusion,” the company said in a statement. “We agree those issues should be fixed and are pleased to put this behind us and proceed with these customer service-enhancing changes.” They Call It Cramming Indeed, even though the FCC fielded thousands of complaints, that amounts to a small percentage of Comcast’s actual customer base. Telecommunications industry analyst Jan Dawson agrees that it appears that it these particular complaints came from a small subsection of Comcast subscribers, but points out that the practice of adding small fees to customers’ bills has been so common over the years there’s even a name for it: cramming. Ultimately, it’s not clear how common the problem actually is. “We don’t know the people who didn’t file complaints,” Forscey says. But she believes the number of complains show that these weren’t isolated incidents, rather “a fundamental operation as to how these companies are treating their consumers.” What’s more, the problem wasn’t just that customers were being billed for services they didn’t sign-up for. It was also ridiculously hard to get those fees reversed, often requiring customers to spend hours on the phone. That sort of thing is certainly in keeping with a the long history of complaints about Comcast that has led to it being ranked at the bottom of 24/7 Wall St.’s annual customer satisfaction poll for seven years in a row. Keep an Eye Out In addition to the fees, Comcast has agreed to implement a five year plan to prevent this sort of thing in the future. Under the plan, Comcast will allow customers to “lock” their accounts so new services can’t added, and will refrain from referring disputed charges to collection agencies while the dispute is still under investigation. But Dawson says we should all still be vigilant. “In any company of sufficient size you’ll always get individuals or managers who bend the rules to try to hit their targets,” he says. “So I’m sure we’ll continue to see at least some examples of this sort of thing going forward.” So keep an eye on your bill for weird fees.

We’ll need more bandwidth for streaming high-definition video, strolling through virtual worlds, and, well, doing things no one has even thought of yet. But Google worries that Internet service providers won’t give us all the bandwidth we’ll need. So it’s taking matters into its own hands. Several years ago, it unveiled Google Fiber, providing ultra-high-speed Internet connections to home and businesses in certain select cities. This redefined notions of how fast our Internet speeds should be, and in some cases, it significantly increased competition among service providers. But Google has been slow to push the service into new places. And the fact of the matter is that most people are still stuck with much slower connections. So, in order to accelerate this revolution, Google is turning to wireless technologies. Today, the fastest Internet connections arrive via wire line. Your home connection is faster than the connection to your mobile phone. But Google is exploring a different breed of wireless that could provide a way of more rapidly pushing high-speed connections into homes and offices across the country. Earlier this year, officials in Kansas City approved a Google plan to place experimental wireless antennas on the city’s light poles so that the company could expand its network of Internet connections without tapping into wire lines. And a new document, first spotted by Business Insider, reveals that Google is planning to expand those experiments into other cities, including Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; and Provo, Utah. The document signals that Google is serious about delivering Internet over the 3.5GHz radio spectrum, a swath of spectrum that the FCC opened up for broadband use last year. All this is part of much larger effort to accelerate the evolution of our Internet connections. Google recently acquired an Internet service provider that was exploring similar technology, and Facebook is building new wireless antennas that can not speed up our Internet connections and even them into new places. The fiber-optic wire line pipes required to deliver Google Fiber style gigabit Internet connections are already available across much of the country. The problem is that it’s very expensive to connect those backbone pipes to people’s homes and offices—the so-called “last mile” of an Internet connection. This often involves digging up people’s yards, or even tearing up streets and sidewalks. In Kansas City, the first place Google Fiber offered its service, Google was able to cut its deployment costs by negotiating deals to run its cables along existing utility lines. But the company hasn’t had as much luck gaining access to utility poles in other cities. For example, AT&T sued to prevent Google Fiber from accessing its utility poles in Louisville, Kentucky. That could be a big part of why Google appears to be shifting its focus to wireless technologies, which, in theory, should be much cheaper to deploy and could eventually offer speeds that are competitive with fixed line fiber optic connections. Google Fiber recently delayed its plans to deploy fiber in Silicon Valley and Portland, Oregon, and is reportedly considering offering wireless Internet access instead. Meanwhile, Google recently acquired an Internet provider called WebPass. WebPass already uses wireless back haul in providing high-speed connections to apartment buildings in San Francisco. And through its partnership with a company called Artemis Networks, it could one day offer something more radical. Artemis has been working on something called pCell networks, which could improve bandwidth further still. Unlike Google, Facebook doesn’t seem interested in becoming an Internet service provider. But it’s still investing heavily in technologies that aim to improve Internet access. Earlier this year, the company unveiled an ambitious plan to build new types of antennas and other wireless technologies and give the designs away freely to telcos. This includes ARIES, which the company hopes will be used to beam Internet access into hard to reach rural areas, and Terragraph, which is designed to help improve WiFi and cellular coverage in cities. Of course, the world won’t depend entirely on wireless Internet. Both companies are heavily investing in undersea cables, and Google’s parent company Alphabet is also trenching pipe for Internet connections in Ghana. But when it comes to the last mile, both companies envision a wireless future. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Broadband Google Fiber Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

For seven years in a row Comcast ranked at the bottom of 24/7 Wall St.’s annual customer satisfaction poll. Now the company’s business practices may land it in court. This week Washington state filed a $100 million lawsuit against Comcast, accusing the company of 1.8 million violations of the the state’s Consumer Protection Act. The state isn’t suing Comcast for bad customer service per se, but for the sorts of misleading claims and practices that have given Comcast such a poor public image. (Comcast denies any wrongdoing.) The state’s biggest grievance appears to be Comcast’s $4.99-per-month “Service Protection Plan,” which Washington attorney general Bob Ferguson’s office calls “near-worthless.” According to the lawsuit, Comcast promoted the plan as a single-fee program that would cover all service calls, including those that involved in-wall wiring. The catch? Any work on “wires concealed within walls requiring wall fishing” was excluded, an exception the suit says meant customers would still have to pay for most in-wall service calls. Related Stories Comcast’s Netflix Deal Could Open a New Front in Net Neutrality War Gunning for Google, Comcast Preps Gigabit Internet That Works With Regular Cable Layer3 TV’s Crazy Plan to Take on Comcast and Reinvent Cable “The plan does not, in fact, cover the vast majority of inside wiring,” the Ferguson’s announcement alleges, adding that customer service scripts given to Comcast representatives deliberately misled customers. The service’s limitations are now spelled out on the Comcast’s website, but the state claims those changes were made only recently “on the verge of this litigation.” According to the suit, Comcast not only buried the exceptions to the plan in the fine print but failed to give customers a copy of the fine print, or even tell them that the fine print exists. Comcast disputes that the plan was misleading, saying it covered more than 99 percent of customers’ repair calls. “We worked with the Attorney General’s office to address every issue they raised, and we made several improvements based on their input,” Comcast said in a statement. The company said it was disappointed the attorney general’s office had chosen to sue instead of continuing to work with Comcast. “We stand behind our products and services and will vigorously defend ourselves.” This isn’t the first time that Ferguson has gone after a telco over deceptive advertising. In 2013, the attorney general’s investigation into T-Mobile concluded that the mobile service provider’s ads promising “no contracts” mislead customers. T-Mobile settled with the state by adding disclaimers about the consequences of canceling your T-Mobile service before you’ve paid off your phone. This time around, Ferguson is looking for more than just a few disclaimers. The lawsuit seeks to have customers’ service call fees refunded and their credit scores revised. (Along with the allegedly misleading service plans, the lawsuit also claims that Comcast damaged customers’ credit scores by running unauthorized credit checks.) Maybe none of this will make your wait time faster during your next call to Comcast. But it just might make the company take a harder look at its scripts it provides its customer service reps. Bad customer service may not be a crime. But it sure feels like an injustice. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. cable Comcast telecoms Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

But it might not work the same way the high-speed fiber optic Internet service does elsewhere. On Wednesday, the San Francisco-based Internet service provider Webpass announced that Google Fiber has agreed to buy the company. Webpass primarily offers what it calls “point-to-point wireless” service to businesses, apartment buildings and condos in five metropolitan areas—San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, Boston, and Miami. What this means is that Webpass beams Internet to a fixed antenna on the building, and then runs data cables into each unit. From the end-user’s perspective, the connection is simply a traditional ethernet port like you’d find in corporate offices or dorm rooms. Webpass advertises connections as fast 1Gps–the same speed as Google Fiber—for either $550 per year or $65 per month for the 1Gbps service. Landlords can also opt to pay for the service and offer it as an amenity to residents. That’s less than Google charges for the same speed: a 1Gbps fixed-line fiber optic service goes for about $80 a month. A Google Fiber spokesperson says that Webpass’s pricing and branding will remain the same after the acquisition. The Webpass approach differs from Google’s Fiber’s usual model, which involves running fiber optic cables to customers’ homes. But earlier this year Google Fiber began testing wireless Internet service in Kansas City in an attempt to cut the costs of deploying high-speed connections. And this spring Google Fiber announced that it would offer service to select San Francisco apartments and condos, so this move seems to fit well with that strategy. “Joining Google Fiber will be a great development for our users because the companies share the same vision of the future and commitment to the customer,” Webpass president Charles Barr wrote on the Webpass blog. “Google Fiber’s resources will enable Webpass to grow faster and reach many more customers than we could as a standalone company.” Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but according to Barr’s post, the acquisition should close this summer. This isn’t the first time Google Fiber has acquired an existing provider. In 2013 the company acquired the Provo, Utah fiber-optic network iProvo. But it does represent a shift in the company’s overall strategy, away from building entirely new infrastructure. If Google Fiber is serious about becoming a nationwide Internet provider to rival Comcast, Verizon and Charter, more acquisitions will surely follow. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Today the company announced that it will make its high-speed internet service available to San Francisco apartments, condos, and affordable housing properties where fiber optic cables are already available. The announcement echoes Monday’s news that Google Fiber will bring its service to Huntsville, Alabama, where it will license the city-owned fiber optic infrastructure and share that infrastructure with other providers. “By using existing fiber to connect some apartments and condos, as we’ve done before, we can bring service to residents more quickly,” Google Fiber director of business operations Michael Slinger said.

The service is already available in Kansas City; Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah and Atlanta, Georgia. Many other cities, including San Antonio and Nashville, have also been slated for Fiber. This isn’t the first time Google has tried to offer Internet in San Francisco, which for a tech hub can be notoriously resistant to change. In 2007, Google and Earthlink proposed a city-wide WiFi service to San Francisco that ultimately fizzled. Let’s just hope its plans for Google Fiber work out better. Go Back to Top.

The bad news: the legislation contains loopholes that could allow “Internet fast lanes”—the very preferential treatment that net neutrality is supposed to restrict. As the name suggests, the Telecoms Single Market legislation is meant to establish a single telecommunications market for all of Europe. The regulations, which have been debated for over two years, also include provisions that prohibit most roaming fees by mobile carriers and ban most forms of traffic discrimination by Internet service providers. But critics find protections for both net neutrality and against roaming fees too weak. Estelle Masse, a policy analyst for the the Internet freedom advocacy group Access Now, says that the legislation allows Internet service providers and mobile carriers not to charge for certain types of a data—a practice called “zero rating.” The organization also worries about over-broad language that would allow providers to charge varying rates for “specialized services.” The fear is that this could provide “fast lanes” and “slow lanes” for certain types of content, such as streaming video, or give companies whose data services are zero-rated an unfair advantage over others. Julia Reda, a member of the European Parliament representing the Pirate Party, argued in a statement today that even the roaming protections are too weak because they will still allow carriers to apply roaming fees if a customer exceeds certain undefined limits. Network neutrality advocates sought to close the loopholes with a pair of amendments. Today, however, European lawmakers, eager to have the regulations in place, passed the rules without the amendments. But all is not lost for network neutrality advocates. Masse notes in a blog post today that the passage of the legislation opens a nine month “consultation period” during which regulators will hammer out the new rules in more detail. That creates an opportunity to close those loopholes once and for all. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Access Broadband Europe european union network neutrality Skip Social.

Today the Chattanooga Electric Power Board, the city-owned power utility, says that it is now offering 10 gigabit connections—nearly 1,000 faster than the average broadband connection in the US—to every business and residence in the city for about $300 a month. It will also offer three and five gigabit speed connections in addition its existing one gigabit service. Chattanooga was one of the first cities to bypass large commercial Internet service providers and start offering city-run gigabit-speed fiber services for its citizens back in 2008—about five years before Google Fiber brought comparable speeds to Kansas City. Commercial providers naturally hate these sorts of government-funded initiatives—known as municipal broadband—and have fought to pass laws to prohibit them in many states. Comcast, for example, unsuccessfully sued the Chattanooga Electric Power Board in 2008 in an attempt to block the network’s funding. But the legal tide has been turning, and commercial providers are slowly beginning to actually try to compete. Earlier this year Comcast announced that Chattanooga would be among the first cities in which it would sell its new $300-per-month two-gigabit Internet service. It’s hard to see the new 10 gigabit service as anything more than an attempt to not be outdone by Comcast. Few home users will be able to take advantage of that much bandwidth, but schools and other large organizations could see a real benefit. At the same time, there’s something bigger at work. Municipal broadband providers are raising expectations nationwide for what good Internet service means, forcing commercial providers to improve their infrastructure. And by increasing the amount of bandwidth available, they could be setting the stage for the creation of new, more bandwidth-hungry applications. This is how better service goes from a “nice-to-have” to a “you’d-better-have” for the country’s recalcitrant cable companies. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

The company will work with local leaders in each city during the coming months to reach its decision. At the same time, Google Fiber is still considering bringing the its service to Portland, Oregon; Phoenix; and San Jose, California, a spokesperson said. Google Fiber is already available in the Kansas City metro area; Provo, Utah; and Austin, Texas. Earlier this year the company announced plans to expand into Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, and Nashville. Google Fiber is one of the entities being spun out of Google as an independent business under the new holding company Alphabet as part of a reorganization announced last month. Go Back to Top.

SUBSCRIBE Rethinking today’s attribution problem in digital marketing Proper attribution modeling is one of the biggest challenges facing marketers today. Columnist Christi Olson discusses the common gaps in attribution and some ideas for thinking more holistically about your digital marketing campaigns. Christi Olson on October 12, 2016 at 11:52 am More Attribution is the science behind assigning values to individual touch points throughout a customer’s decision journey. It’s not only a key driver in how we currently optimize marketing campaigns, but attribution is also used for media mix modeling and developing media budgets. Herein lies the problem: marketers tend to look at attribution within our own channel silo, so it’s not easy to understand the full picture of a multi-channel environment. As search continues to evolve in form and function, it’s raising some important questions around how we think about and use attribution models — and is putting some of our long-held practices to the test. Do you have an attribution problem? Attribution modeling has seen incredible progress over the years, offering increasingly better solutions to track touch points throughout a conversion. While progress has been made, the attribution models that most companies are using today offer a partial solution that tracks only online conversions and channels. Most companies are just beginning to scratch the surface of multi-channel and cross-device attribution. Technology companies are still piecing together the components needed to provide a full solution to fill in the gaps in current attribution models. It leaves us to question, do we have an attribution problem that we might not be aware of? The simple way to answer the question is to look at your analytics data and see if a significant portion of overall conversions have a long, multi-step path. Or in other words, are your customers engaging across multiple channels? If the answer is yes, a significant portion of your conversions come from paths that contain 2+ steps, then you most likely have an attribution problem. Here is how you can see this for yourself: In Google Analytics, navigate to Conversions > Multi-Channel Funnels Report, and then look at the Path Length report. This report will provide you with a simple breakdown of the quantity of paths. You should also view the Top Conversion Paths report to understand which channels play a role at each step of the consumer’s digital journey. I do want to acknowledge that this report is limited to just your digital channels, unless you’re pulling in additional conversion data from offline channels into analytics. Mind the attribution gap In June, Aaron Levy wrote an excellent post on the best attribution model for search. In it, he describes the top rules-based attribution models, along with the high-level pros and cons of each model. I’m going to dig a little deeper into the topic, and I’m going to start by discussing the two major attribution gaps you need to be aware of when it comes to attribution models. Online-to-offline attribution The first gap in attribution is in understanding the impact of online channels’ ability to drive offline revenue. Most analytics platforms and their attribution models are only providing a partial solution by looking at the digital conversions and revenue, not including the online impact to offline sales/leads/in-store visits. Of the two major gaps in attribution, this is one of the easiest gaps to solve with moderate accuracy based on extrapolating information from available data sources to link online activity to offline user behavior. The easy solution that many businesses take is to use some sort of unique promotion code by channel to tie attribution together. This gives consumers a choice in where they can convert and allows you to track the conversion. Google is working on solving this attribution problem with their “In-Store Visits” metric, which uses a number of signals to gauge online-to-offline impact, including Google Maps data, GPS, WiFi, visitor queries and data from over a million opted-in users, which is then used to create store visit estimates. Analytics and advertising platforms are leveraging data from cell phones such as WiFi, GPS and beacons tied to in-app networks. Even mobile forms of payment like mobile wallets will help to answer the online-to-offline attribution question. While these methods aren’t a perfect solution because they don’t track a specific user’s behavior, they are a start in the right direction to solving the online-to-offline gap. Cross-device attribution The second and most difficult gap in attribution is in measuring consumer behaviors and interactions across screens and devices. Are we tracking consumers across devices and across channels? Can we? This is an attempt to answer the questions, “How do consumers engage with a brand across devices?,” “Which channels are they engaging with on each device?” and “On which device do they finally convert?” This is one of the biggest attribution challenges because consumers use a multitude of screens (TV, desktop, tablets, smartphone and more) throughout their journey. As consumers switch across devices, it’s difficult — nay, almost impossible — to maintain the unique IDs to track the customer journey both offline (through TV viewing) and online. This is going to be the most difficult gap to close due to the complexity needed to track unique users across multiple screens. Today, advertisers attempt to bridge the gap by looking at data and finding correlations between interactions across screens. There are a few large companies who can close this gap through logged-in states across multiple screens and devices (think Apple, Facebook, Comcast), though potentially not across all of the screens and devices we use regularly. The cross-screen, multi-channel attribution will only get more difficult as search powers experiences away from the search box, such as voice search through personal digital assistants and Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality technology. Regardless of the attribution model chosen and the gaps that exist across all attribution models today, the purpose is still the same: to understand the value each channel brings to the marketing mix in moving customers along their decision journey. The goal we should be focusing on as marketers is understanding how to integrate search into the journey and create more holistic campaigns that focus on the consumer. Tallying touch points from a rules-based model may be detracting from the higher goal of creating deeper, lasting customer relationships. First- & last-click see their last days In my own experience, many companies employ either first-click or last-click attribution models. First-click (or first-touch) attribution models give 100 percent of the credit for a conversion to the consumer’s first touch point, whereas last-click attribution models assign conversion credit to the last touch point leading up to a conversion. It’s easy to scrutinize either of these popular models because they focus solely on either the top of the funnel (first-click) or the bottom of the funnel (last-click). Indeed, as a result of their disregard for all other marketing activities, both first-click and last-click attribution models are heading toward their last days. Using the last-click model means mean that you are either ignoring early, top-of-funnel activity and instead focusing on bottom-of-funnel elements like branded search and remarketing (which tend to drive the final conversion). Without giving value to the top-of-funnel channels, sooner or later, your remarketing efforts will dry up. First-click attribution comes with similar problems — by giving all the credit to the first touch point, you obscure the true value of critical middle- and bottom-of-funnel efforts in moving the customer through the buyer journey and closing the sale. Other attribution models, such as time-decay and metric-driven, offer more sophisticated modeling but still end up assigning arbitrary values and leaving gaps when customers switch between channels, especially when going from online to offline. Even within our own channel, search is no longer about singular conversions. Keywords are now being evaluated in a much larger context, not just for immediate conversions but how they assist throughout the consumer decision journey. They are helping consumers explore, research, compare, locate, purchase and follow up. Search has seen rapid growth in both form and function since its inception less than 30 years ago. In form, it’s broken out of the text box, appearing on our phones, in our cars, at home on our speakers, in our TV remotes and gaming systems. It’s in bed on our tablets and phones. Wherever we go, search is with us across devices. In function, we’ve started relying on search as inter-communicative partners. Search has gone beyond simple voice input and is evolving to understand user intent and behaviors through available data to help consumers take action. Through search, we can order a pizza, rent a car, buy movie tickets and compare insurance quotes — all within the results pages. How could search, or any digital channel for that matter, possibly still be graded on one click prior to a conversion? It simply can’t. The future of campaigns Rather than being a siloed line item in the marketing mix, search has proven itself to be an integrated component of a much larger machine focused on lasting relationships or CLVs (customer lifetime values). Today’s marketers are adopting a new approach that tears down the siloed walls of search, social, display and offline channels to create one holistic brand experience. Holistic campaigns support deeper, more meaningful customer relationships and distinguish themselves with the following factors: Getting personal with digital fingerprints Creating highly personalized campaigns is an extremely effective way to strengthen your customer relationships.  There are many new tools in search that allow you to personalize the search experience, such as remarketing or customer match. But before you launch individual campaigns, you should first think holistically about how a campaign will integrate with other campaigns. Each consumer has a unique digital fingerprint, which is an evolved concept from the traditional “digital footprint” that centers around following a user’s online trail. A digital fingerprint signifies much more: a user’s unique online preferences as they embark on highly individualized journeys, “depending on cost of failure, frequency, cost and complexity of the task, and the type of shopper.” (Bing Ads Customer Decision Journey report). Each consumer displays highly personal patterns and preferences throughout the relationship-building process. They may rely more heavily on email, spend more time on social, prefer tablets and so forth. Your challenge will be to create a holistic brand experience that consumers can tap into based on their unique digital fingerprints. Although the three consumers below have unique digital fingerprints, they should all experience a unified, holistic brand. Rethinking your future campaigns As you rethink your future search campaigns with a new, holistic approach, we recommend the following: Carefully select an attribution model that will support — and not work against — holistic marketing efforts. Refrain from using oversimplified models, such as either first or last click, which will not sustain long-term multi-channel campaigns. Evaluate your keywords based on more than the final conversion metric. Look at assists to make sure that you’re supporting customers throughout the entire consumer decision journey. Look at other metrics based on where the keyword fits within the journey, such as time on site, page views, product page views and other customer loyalty indicators. Include keywords that support customers throughout each stage of the consumer decision journey as they engage with search as an inter-communicative partner Include campaign-specific keywords within your search campaigns so that consumers can easily find you after seeing a TV ad, remembering a billboard, hearing your jingle or seeing your logo. In the case of tracking online to offline or vice versa, include unique promotional codes to tie purchases back to a unique marketing channel. Be aware of your consumers’ unique digital fingerprints and how your customers will experience your brand across different channels at different times with different connectivity points.

For those who pay closer attention to its business dealings, the company also invests billions to find new ways to use the power of computers: it’s developing robots, virtual reality gear and self-driving cars. Remember all the hubbub about Google Glass? Google has been using the same approach in sustainability – spreading its wealth in a variety of projects to cut its waste and carbon footprint, initiatives which may one day generate profits. During the SXSW Eco conference this week, I caught up with Google’s sustainability officer, Kate Brandt, to find out more. Brandt joined the company in July last year after serving as the nation’s chief sustainability officer in the Obama administration. During her keynote at SXSW Eco in Austin, Texas, Brandt hit all the key environmental initiatives that Google had undertaken over the past decade – at least those that have been announced. Some of the projects involve collecting and analyzing data that enable Google and other businesses to use more sustainable materials, reduce their environmental impact and cut emissions. “When we think about the Third Industrial Revolution and the role Google played in it, we also think about the Fourth Industrial Revolution where this digital backbone could transform our relationship to the material world. We would like to be a player,” she said during her keynote. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the buzzterm for describing the deepening role that technology plays in our lives. To catch a fishing thief, SkyTruth uses data from the air, land and sea Read more Understandably, Google is big on reducing energy use at its data centers. Another often-cited effort: the company is a big wind and solar energy investor, having signed 2.5 gigawatts worth of contracts around the world and, additionally, committed to investing $2.5bn in renewable energy, including owning stakes in power plants. That makes the company the largest corporate renewable energy buyer if you don’t count utilities, Brandt said. Brandt wouldn’t tell me whether the company plans to put money into energy storage, which is seen as a complementary, if not must-have, technology for renewable energy in overtaking fossil fuels. Energy storage, such as batteries, makes it possible to use renewable energy at a time when solar or wind farms can’t produce electricity. The energy storage market is fairly new, with lots of experiments with a variety of technologies and ways to reduce costs. Brandt said one of the surprising things she learned when she first arrived at Google was the company’s project to create a database of the composition and environmental impact of building materials, something she didn’t know about before. The company had been using the database, called Portico, for its own construction projects, but released a web app last week to make the data more publicly available. Brandt isn’t the first hire at Google to work on sustainability. The tech giant has a decentralized approach: there have been teams embedded in different business units that look at ways to reduce energy use, emissions and waste and to boost productivity and revenues. For instance, there’s a team called Geo for Good that investigates the use of maps, data and machine learning to solve environmental problems, such as creating databases and software to monitor the health of tropical forests around the world or track illegal fishing. There’s also a team that works on serving sustainably grown food within the company. Google-powered map helps fight deforestation Read more But Brandt appears to have been hired to come up with big picture strategies and make more efficient use of all these disparate sustainability initiatives. That means a lot of cajoling and negotiations with people who don’t necessarily have to answer to her. This is where her experience working as the country’s chief sustainability officer comes in handy, she said. “My current role [is to work] across a lot of different teams. These challenges are so big that it requires partnership,” she told me. What Google does internally is fascinating. At a sustainability conference in June, I attended a panel of three Google employees who recounted their effort to promote reusable menstrual cups, which help to reduce the amount of pads and tampons that end up in landfills. The discussion provided an interesting look into the skepticism and struggle the three women faced in persuading their fellow Googlers to try something new. And, of course, data played a big role: numbers to show the growing public interest in menstrual cups and the large expenses that Google spends on pads and tampons. They ran a pilot project at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View that saw all 250 cups being used in half of the expected time frame and received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback. So the Googlers began looking to do another pilot at a different Google office. I also learned that reducing meat consumption is a touchy subject at Google, where engineers are pampered and cloistered to maximize their productivity. “When we did ‘Meatless Monday’, there was a group that set up a barbecue just outside of the café,” said one of the Google employees at the June conference. So what does Brandt do personally to set a good example? “I take our shuttle to work,” she said, before switching to “we” and her talking points from her keynote. “We are focused on composting, recycling and reusing our water bottles,” she said, pointing to a water bottle on the table in front of her. “We have a bin that’s green for composting, blue for recycling and a little bit of [space] hanging off to the side that’s for landfill waste.” More blogposts Topics Google Corporate social responsibility Climate change Smart cities Alphabet Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Google and Facebook are working together to lay a nearly 8,000-mile fiber-optic cable between Los Angeles and Hong Kong. The cable will have a bandwidth of 120 terabits per second, Google said, adding that this makes it the highest-capacity route between the United States and Asia. TechCrunch adds: Once the new 12,800 km cable is at full capacity, it'll be the highest-capacity trans-Pacific cable yet. Until now, that record was held by the FASTER cable, which Google also has a stake in. Google tells TechCrunch that all parties participating in building the cable will have their own portion of the cable and that the company will have its own fiber pair to keep its own traffic private. The new cable will become the sixth submarine cable that Google has a stake in (the others are Unity, SJC, FASTER, MONET and Tannat). While it may seem unusual for Google to partner with Facebook on this kind of project, submarine cables often feature these kind of partnerships. Facebook and Microsoft recently teamed up to build a trans-Atlantic cable, for example, which at 160 Tbps is even faster than the Pacific Light cable (but also only half as long). Amazon, too, is starting to invest in its own submarine cables, but so far, the company has not partner with other industry giants to do so. facebook google internet ← You may like to read: → AVTECH Shuns Security Firm and Leaves All Products Vulnerable Without a Patch Donald Trump Wins US Presidency VC, Entrepreneur Says Basic Income Would Work Even If 90% People 'Smoked Pot' and Didn't Work Yelp Employee Posts Open Letter About Cost Of Living And Low Wages, Gets Fired Universal Basic Income Programs Arrive Russia Unveils 'Satan 2' Missile Powerful Enough To 'Wipe Out UK, France Or Texas' Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Recall Is an Environmental Travesty This discussion has been archived.

The latest update that seems to be slowly rolling out makes the persistent search bar at the top of the Google Now Launcher homescreen a bit more useful.

The users claim to be using the latest version of the Google beta application and adds a transparent widget to your home screen. The information here varies, as one user found weather information, while the other user was presented with travel information. We here at Phandroid have yet to see this new widget make an appearance, so it’s more than likely a server-side switch that needs to be flipped.

While other carriers pushed updates straight to the unlocked version of the phone, Verizon’s patch testing and verification process delayed them by months at a time.  In a statement to Ars Technica, Verizon broke it down: “"First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google.”  Ars provides further detail that could be the real reason behind the timely updates: Verizon’s Pixels are unlocked, just like the ones you can purchase through the Google Store. Compared to the GSM or CDMA-specific treatment we saw done with previous Nexus phones, you can hop back and forth between carriers if you please with a Pixel purchased through Verizon, or even give Google’s own Project Fi a go.  Via Android Police Tags Samsung Galaxy ABOUT THE AUTHOR Cameron Faulkner Cameron is the US mobile editor at TechRadar, covering the tech that's in your pocket, wrapped around your wrist, and strapped to your face.

Now, less than a week later, Verizon has contacted ArsTechnica to state that it won’t be delaying updates. Good right? Seemingly to clarify the situation, Verizon had the following to say: First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google. That contradicts what Google told us last week. Where Google stated that Verizon would manage system updates (but not security updates), Verizon is stating that its devices will receive the update similar to how iOS devices do, with updates pushed directly from Apple (or in the case of the Pixel, Google). In other words, Verizon is saying that Google will actually be pushing the update. You could chalk all this up to one big misunderstanding, but that seems unlikely considering the Google gave us the first statement an entire week ago. Now, Google has corroborated what Ars heard from Verizon, saying “OS updates and monthly security patches will be updated on all Pixel devices (Verizon and non-Verizon versions) simultaneously.” Confused yet? We are too. We’ve reached out to Google to get further clarification on the matter and once we get a reply, we’ll further clarify the situation. Last, Verizon also mentioned to ArsTechnica that Verizon Pixels would come installed with three Verizon apps (MyVerizon, go90, and Verizon Messaging), as we mentioned last week, however, the carrier has confirmed that none will be system apps. The device is also unlocked for use on other carriers (as all Verizon devices are), but as far as we know the bootloader is still locked. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

It’s yet another camera app for you to play around with, but it’s an undeniably cool concept that I’m not sure has ever been done before (at least not like this)… Imagine Google’s Photo Sphere camera feature, but quick, fun, and imperfect. That’s Sprayscape. Instead of spending five minutes creating a perfectly stitched together 360-degree photo, Sprayscape lets you “spray” photos on the sphere quickly and effortlessly. Sprayscape is a quick hack using the phone’s gyroscope to take pictures on the inside of a 360-degree sphere. Just point your phone and tap the screen to spray faces, places, or anything else onto your canvas. And as you’d expect, once you’ve made your Sprayscape, you can tap and scroll around it or you can even view it in virtual reality if you want. It admittedly isn’t the most immersive VR experience ever since it doesn’t really feel like a recreation of real life, but it’s cool. You can grab the app on the Play Store right now for free. Let us know what you think in the comments, and feel free to share some of your first creations!

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Sprayscape app for Android makes trippy 360-degree photos Brittany A. Roston - Oct 12, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has launched a new Android camera app called ‘Sprayscape.’ With it, users are given a 360-degree spherical blank canvas in which they can ‘spray’ photos in whatever mishmash they’d like, the end results more often than not being a trippy amalgamation of various scenes and objects. The app is part of Android Experiments, and the resulting content can be viewed on a phone with or without Google Cardboard. Sprayscape isn’t like other 360-degree photo apps — in those cases, a panorama is stitched together into a sphere presenting a single cohesive scene. Google’s experimental Android app is different; it presents a sphere as essentially a blank canvas, and users use their phone’s camera to ‘spray’ content inside of it. This can include long sprays of entire scenes or quick sprays that are akin to single snapshots. Sprayscape works by utilizing the smartphone’s gyroscope. After filling a sphere with content, the 360-degree photo can then be shared from within the app — you can share on Facebook or share a link, the latter of which requires you to sign into your Google account. Finished ‘scapes’ are saved to your Google Drive account, while the link can be shared however you’d like: text, email, WhatsApp, etc. Those who receive the link will be taken directly to your scape within their mobile browser, no app download necessary. Tapping the small headset icon in the bottom left corner will let you view it with Google Cardboard. You can download Sprayscape for Android from the Google Play Store now. The app will be coming to iOS soon.

But what about specs? Here's a nuts-and-bolts comparison of the Pixel and iPhone 7. Size Many Android manufacturers make their phones a little larger and flatter than iPhones, and Google is no exception. The Pixel is about 4-percent taller and wider than the iPhone 7, but only 0.2-millimeter thicker. Keep in mind that each phone is the "little brother" within its lineup. The Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus are both bigger phones, and we'll take a side-by-side look at those separately. Weight The bigger Pixel is proportionately heavier. It weighs 3.5-percent (about the weight of a nickel) more than the iPhone. Build In terms of construction, both phones play it safe with a glass front and aluminum unibody. Colors The iPhone has more color options, with matte black, glossy black and three metallic tones. Pixel keeps it simple with black, blue and silver. Let's be honest though – those colors are probably going under a phone case, anyway. Water resistance This year, we saw improved water resistance in mobile technology across the board. Even though this is the first year iPhones have had a water resistance rating (they can withstand accidental immersion in water up to one meter deep, for up to half an hour), a lack of water resistance in the Pixel seems like a misstep. Display size It's no surprise that the bigger Pixel has a larger display. Neither phone optimizes its screen-to-size ratio particularly well, though. They both have significant blank space on their "chins" and "foreheads". Display resolution Pixel lives up to its name and wins the pixel density war handily (which is important for using the phone as a VR device – see below). Still, resolution isn't the only indicator of a quality display. The iPhone gets kudos for its color accuracy and contrast. We'll have to take a closer look at the Pixel in our forthcoming full-length review. Display type Apple is one of the few manufacturers still clinging to IPS display technology; Google uses AMOLED in the Pixel. We're still not sure if this means the Pixel will have an "always-on" display mode like many other AMOLED-sporting flagships do, though it does not appear to. Pressure-sensitive display This feature can be difficult to describe to folks that haven't picked up an iPhone in a while. Current iPhones (with the exception of the dainty SE) come equipped with a pressure-sensitive display, which provides navigational shortcuts based on how long and hard you press the screen. Apple calls this bit of technology "3D Touch." To us, 3D Touch has potential, but it hasn't been realized yet. Camera megapixels Pixel sneaks past the iPhone with one more megapixel in the selfie camera, where it counts the most. Camera aperture (rear) iPhone bests the Pixel in terms of camera aperture. The smaller the f-stop, the larger the aperture, which is generally a good thing. It means more light can access the imaging sensor, for better photos in low-light conditions. Optical image stabilization Optical image stabilization staves off unwanted photo blur that arises from hand shake and long exposure times. iPhone has it, Pixel doesn't. Dual rear camera Just to be clear, it's the iPhone 7 Plus that comes equipped with an optical zoom-enabling dual lens rear camera. Both of these phones have a single lens. Battery The Pixel has a considerably bigger battery than the iPhone 7. Google estimates that a full charge will get you up to 26 hours of talk time or up to 13 hours of internet use or video playback. On the iPhone 7, Apple says you'll get up to 14 hours of talk time, 12 hours of internet use, or up to 13 hours of video playback. Fast charging According to Google, the Pixel can get up to 7 hours of use from only 15 minutes of charging. iPhone users are still waiting for similar convenience. Wireless charging Neither phone can be charged wirelessly. Processor We'll perform a benchmark test on the Pixel soon, but it seems like Apple's A10 fusion chip is a touch faster than the duly capable Snapdragon 821 in the Pixel. RAM Pixel has twice the RAM of the iPhone 7, so it should be well equipped for any software application. Still, it is worth mentioning that iPhones have always performed efficiently with relatively low amounts of RAM. Storage Both phones are available in 32 or 128-gigabyte capacities. In addition, iPhone 7 has an extremely capacious 256-gigabyte option. If you want the new glossy black iPhone, you'll have to spring for one of the two larger sizes, as the 32 GB size is not available in jet black. microSD External storage has never been an iPhone option, but many Android adherents may be frustrated about microSD missing from the Pixel, a Nexus/Pixel tradition. VR compatible Pixel is compatible with the new Google Daydream View virtual reality (VR) headset. In fact, it's even shipping with Daydream for free in the U.S. as part of a temporary pre-order promotion. Once Daydream View ships in November, we'll be able to weigh it up against the current leading mobile VR headset, Gear VR. We are excited to check out Daydream's microfiber construction and test its accompanying controller. Considering that consumer VR hit the market this year in a big way, we're wondering if and when Apple will follow suit. Headphone jack Apple's never been shy about axing hardware; the headphone jack on the iPhone hit the chopping block this year. iPhone 7 does ship with a headphone-to-Lightning adapter as well as Lightning port earbuds, but if you want to use your current headphones without any extra cordage, opt for a Pixel. Fingerprint sensor Both phones have fingerprint sensors, and both manufacturers bestow upon them a glib proprietary moniker: Google's is "Pixel Imprint" and Apple's is "Touch ID". The Pixel's scanner is on the back of the phone. On the iPhone, the fingerprint scanner is built into the home button. Home button Since smartphone hardware is so similar, the home button experience can be a relatively transformative one. Like many Androids, Pixel has an onscreen home button flanked with back and recent app buttons. The iPhone has the most uniquely capacitive home button around: A solid-state button below the display with an integrated fingerprint sensor, varying levels of pressure sensitivity, and haptic feedback for a real-click feel. Mobile payments Both phones are NFC-equipped, so they can be outfitted with their respective software's mobile payment option. Virtual assistant In addition to being the first Google-branded phone, Pixel is the first to have Google Assistant built-in. Assistant is an improved descendent of Google Now, and it seems to have a few advantages over Siri. For example, Assistant can better handle contextual queries and has useful additions like sending automatic responses and asking follow-up questions. Operating system While Apple pushes the latest software update onto all iPhones (and bricks a few in the process), not all Android phones receive software updates. No need to worry about that with the Pixel, though. As the first Google-branded phone on the market, it's going to showcase the latest and greatest Android software. Pixel launches with a brand-new 7.1 version of Android Nougat, and Google promises two years of OS upgrades and three years of security updates from launch. Release Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL just a few weeks after Apple released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Starting price (full retail) These two flagships are at the exact same price point, which makes them a little bit easier to weigh against each other. When all is said and done, these are two very similarly-equipped phones that promise solid hardware and a cohesive software experience. We'll have better intel once we delve into our full-length review of the Pixel, which we'll post in the coming weeks. In the meantime, you can read up about the iPhone 7 and iOS 10. We bet that Pixel vs. iPhone decisions will come down to either a personal preference on operating system or a hang-up about a particular hardware feature, like VR, water resistance, or the headphone jack.

Now Google has launched an Android Experiment of its own. Sprayscape is a new Android app from Google that uses your phone’s camera and gyroscope to paint onto a 360-degree sphere canvas. You can tap the screen to “spray” onto the canvas, and you can keep moving your phone around to capture different parts of your environment. Unlike a panorama, though, your subjects won’t necessarily be stitched together. Instead, the app will just place images on top of one another. To get a better idea of exactly what Sprayscape is all about, you can check out Google’s promo video above. When you capture a Sprayscape, you can share your images over a text message or on social media. You can also use Google Cardboard to really get into the 360-degree sphere canvas and view the Sprayscape. Sprayscape isn’t an app that you’re going to use to capture photos that you really care about, but it is a fun little app to help you create unique, artsy images. If you want to give it a try for yourself, you can grab it from Google Play right here.

Follow TechnoBuffalo On our podcast earlier today, I told our listeners not to buy the Google Pixel from Verizon. Historically, being tied down to a carrier meant slower software updates, and Verizon is notoriously bad for that. Turns out things are different with the Verizon version of the Google Pixel, though. Here’s what Verizon told Ars Technica: First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google. Also, the Verizon version of the Google Pixel is carrier unlocked, so you can use it where ever you like. Finally, we have three apps pre-installed on the phone Go90, My Verizon (which is your account management tool) and Verizon Messages (your messaging app). As you noted, all three can easily be uninstalled by the user. Why this matters: This is pretty unprecedented for an Android smartphone on a U.S. carrier. Verizon and other carriers usually have a tight grip on all software updates, save for those issued by Apple. Now it looks like Google has managed to get Android the same privilege. With rumors that the Google Pixel is bound for AT&T, too, this is huge news for Android.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | October 12, 2016 -- 18:24 GMT (11:24 PDT) | Topic: Networking Google and Facebook announced Wednesday they are investing in submarine cable system between Los Angeles and Hong Kong -- the first ever with ultra high-capacity. The Silicon Valley giants are teaming up with undersea communications company TE Subcom and Hong Kong-based broadband provider Pacific Light Data Communication (PLDC) to build the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN). It will have 12,800km of fiber and an estimated cable capacity of 120Tbps -- that's enough capacity for Hong Kong to have 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls with Los Angeles. Once completed, PLCN will be the highest-capacity transpacific route. Its commercial launch is slated for the summer of 2018. TE Subcom noted that the system includes its C+L technology, which effectively doubles the available bandwidth and capacity per fiber pair over a traditional C-band-only designed system. In a statement, PLDC chairman Wei Junkang hailed the involvement of Google and Facebook, calling it "a strong signal that PLCN will be trusted to address the capacity needs for internet and international communications services throughout the Pacific Rim". For Google, the investment helps build up the backbone of the Google Cloud Platform, part of the enterprise business rebranded simply as Google Cloud, helping it serve enterprise customers in Asia. The company noted in a blog post that this is the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake. Its Trans-Pacific fiber optic cable system connecting Oregon to Japan, dubbed FASTER, came online over the summer. Google said that the PLCN is "designed to accommodate evolving infrastructure technology, allowing us to independently choose network equipment and refresh optical technology as it advances".

 Two of Google's metrics have been suspended from a key accreditation service used to measure ads Lara O'Reilly Oct. 12, 2016, 2:41 PM 19,316 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Two of Google's ad measurement metrics have been suspended from accreditation from the Media Rating Council (MRC) — a key accreditation service advertisers and publishers use to verify that their ads are being properly measured — over "non-compliance" issues related to the way in which it counts its ad impressions. MRC announced Tuesday the accreditation status of Google DoubleClick for Publishers (DfP) "mobile web served display ad impressions" and certain desktop display ad measurements were suspended in September 2016. The MRC says it expects to reinstate accreditation once DoubleClick becomes compliant again. Google hopes to have the issue resolved "by the end of the year." The reason for Google's non-compliance appears to be a technicality related to guidelines the MRC updated in April, rather than any sense of foulplay, but it comes at a bad time. Many advertisers and publishers are increasingly questioning the validity of the data they receive from huge platforms — not least after Facebook was found last month to have been over-inflating its video view metrics. (Facebook has apologized and rectified the issue.) What happened In April 2016, the MRC, alongside two trade bodies — The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) — updated their guidelines on how online measurement companies should count mobile web and mobile app ad impressions.  Those guidelines now state that an impression shouldn't merely be counted when an ad server is called to serve the ad, but instead that there should be "reasonable assurance that the ad was rendered on the device in order to count it as a valid ad impression." In online ad measurement, "viewability" is extremely important. Advertisers want assurances that the majority of the pixels of their ad were viewed for at least a second or more (and most marketers demand far more than this) and that they were viewed by humans rather than a bot. When the data is taken from the ad server, before it has even loaded on a mobile web page or app, it's very difficult to provide those kinds of assurances. MRC-accredited companies had 30 days to update their systems, otherwise they would lose their accreditation. Google didn't move quickly enough to make the deadline, and by the time its MRC audit came around, it wasn't ready. It might take until the end of the year before Google can implement the changes. The two metrics suspended were Google's DoubleClick for Publishers mobile web impression measurement and DoubleClick for Publishers viewability metrics — which publishers use to verify their ad impressions — until the matter is sorted. Not all of its measurement products have lost their accreditation — all of its advertiser-facing tools are still accredited, for example. (The full list of accredited services can be found here.) A Google spokesperson sent Business Insider this statement: "As the industry transitions to new metrics for how they count ads, we’re working closely with publisher partners, like Business Insider, to make sure they continue to thrive. We’re updating the methodology for our publisher ad server (DFP) to reflect the change, and are working towards renewed MRC accreditation for that methodology by the end of the year. We have dozens of ad metrics with MRC accreditation, all of which remain current." The impact on Google It's unclear whether Google initially intended to take its time, or simply whether its sluggish pace was because it is such a big organization, delivering so many impressions and metrics for advertisers and publishers that it was a huge infrastructure undertaking to switch from measuring served impressions to measuring rendered impressions. Google is often accused of being a "walled garden" because it makes money from both publishers and advertisers and occasionally restricts third-party ad tech companies from accessing its platforms. Meanwhile, Google and Facebook are often accused by advertising leaders of "marking their own homework" by giving out some viewability or other advertising metrics that haven't been verified by third-parties. (Although both certainly do partner with scores of trusted measurement companies.) This won't help Google shake either of those perceptions. Mike Caprio, general manager of programmatic at ad tech company Sizmek, says Google losing its accreditation status is a prime example of why "playing both sides of the fence" is bad for the advertising industry. Sizmek's own testing found a "40%" discrepancy between ads that had simply been "called" and ads that were actually delivered. Discrepancies between the way Google and other ad tech companies measured such ad impressions were causing "confusion" in the marketplace, Caprio said. He added: "For Google, what is most concerning is that they decided to prioritize the seller's needs over the buyers. And what's worse is that in most cases, as the dominant publisher ad server, they are the direct beneficiary through Google Display Network and AdX [Google's ad exchange]." "Independent measurement has always been vital to our industry, so the buy and sell side can have a fair market to do business. The industry needs independent, impartial measurement and campaign management that is uniform and balanced across all parties and through all forms of buying anywhere around the world," Caprio said. A headache for Google. Pixabay As for the real revenue impact on Google, that's also uncertain. Google doesn't break out in its earnings how much it earns from DoubleClick for Publishers. It's doubtful that revenue impact will be material as most fees for DoubleClick for Publishers are tied to SaaS [Software as a Service]-type repeat fees. And on the ad side, many buyers now demand that they are only charged for viewable impressions anyway. However, Google does currently charge some clients on every impression served to publishers' websites, so that will probably have to change to pay-when-rendered if it wants to meet the MRC accredition standards. Anywhere that Google makes money from publishers' display ad impressions will likely be directly, negatively impacted in the short-term, at least from an operating cost perspective, as it builds the technology required to measure rendered impressions. What can be said for certain is that the issue has been an ongoing headache for Google since April and it's still not easing off any time soon.

 The best advice an ex-Googler turned startup CEO has for people in their 20s is just 2 words Jacquelyn Smith Oct. 12, 2016, 2:15 PM 10,213 facebook linkedin twitter email print Liz Wessel. Courtesy of Liz Wessel Liz Wessel is just 26 and already a CEO. After working at Google for two years, the University of Pennsylvania graduate left to cofound WayUp, a site used by hundreds of thousands of college students to find jobs at places like Microsoft, Uber, The New York Times, Disney, and Google. Wessel, the chief executive of her startup, attributes much of her success to following a certain piece of advice that she likes to give to other 20-somethings: "Say yes." "Your 20s are for figuring out who you are — so don't be afraid to take risks, bounce around, travel, and try new things," she tells Business Insider. "I say 'yes' to as many new opportunities and projects as possible, and it has paid off every time so far." Her other best piece of advice: Don't chase money, chase happiness. She says that your 20s are the launching pad for the rest of your life: "You should be focused on finding an industry or career that you really enjoy. If you just optimize for salary or prestige in the short-term, you're potentially be selling out the rest of your life. "For example, I have a few friends who went to work in finance after college purely because it was a career where they knew they could make good money. Almost none of those friends still work in finance, and most of them had a pretty miserable first year out of college — except for the ones who were passionate about finance from the start." The further you go in a given industry, the harder it gets to make the jump from one industry to another, "so start doing what you love as soon as you can," she concludes.

Yahoo adds security event tracking to its Account Info page, but still no “delete” button Posted Oct 12, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Verizon wants you to know its Google Pixel phones will get immediate Android updates Following news of its large-scale data breach affecting 500 million account holders, Yahoo today rolled out a change to its Yahoo Account settings screen that will better alert users to unauthorized activity on their accounts. The feature is similar to Google’s in that it tracks the account activity and devices associated with your Yahoo account, but it doesn’t provide as much detail. In Google’s case, users can view their recent security events (like logins, password changes, changes to recovery options, new app passwords, etc.). This includes the dates and times that their Gmail account was accessed, as well as the IP addresses which were used to access your account. There’s even a map of the location provided as a small thumbnail next to the account activity on the detail screen. And each event is tagged not only with the timestamp, IP and location, you’ll also see which device was used for the activity, as well. Yahoo’s tracking screen is more simplified. The top section shows the recent devices (e.g. Chrome, Mac OS X) where the Yahoo account has been used, followed by a log of the most recent activity or changes to your Yahoo account. However, in this bottom section, Yahoo is only logging the activity and time. You can’t click on each item to see the additional details for each individual event, like IP, device or location. Instead, if you want to drill down to see things like the IP or location, you have to click on the device (Mac OS X, e.g.) at the top of the screen. Here recent sign-ins on that device are listed with locations, IPs and timestamps. The problem with Yahoo’s activity logging is one of design. On the main screen, each item – like a password change – doesn’t have an IP, device and location provided; meanwhile, clicking on the device at the top (where you can see things like IP and location) seems to only show you the logged sessions, not the other activity. This layout makes Yahoo’s activity log more confusing to read and understand than Google’s. Plus, none of this will really help Yahoo users deal with the aftermath of the data breach, which actually took place in 2014. Yahoo passwords have been reset, and the company wiped out the prior answers to users’ security questions. screen_shot_2016-10-12_at_2_10_08_pm screen_shot_2016-10-12_at_2_10_16_pm  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Above: Google’s security event activity info screen, for comparison The problem is that this information, now in the wrong hands, can be used to compromise users’ accounts across the web, not only because of password reuse, but also because many sites ask the same security questions when users attempt password resets. (Like, “what’s your mother’s maiden name?”, “Name of first pet,” etc.) Meanwhile, the company still hasn’t addressed the problem in which it’s made it difficult for users to leave the Yahoo Mail service by disabling the feature that allows them auto-forward their email. (It says it’s “working” on turning it back on.) Nor has it added a simple “delete my account” option from the Account settings screen. Instead, users have to dig through Yahoo’s Help site to find the URL to the “Terminating your Yahoo account” page. It also continues to hold onto Yahoo accounts for 90 days, before permanently deleting them, in case a user chooses to reactive the closed account.

Reprints Reprints Amazon will give users access to a catalog of tens of millions of songs. Credit: Amazon Most Popular Amazon has plunged into the crowded field of music-streaming with its own service that significantly boosts the catalog of songs available through its popular Echo speakers, and offers a pricing option for Prime members that undercuts industry leaders Spotify and Apple. The Music Unlimited subscription from Amazon will be available for $9.99 a month, in line with offers from Spotify and Apple Music, but Prime customers would pay $7.99, or $79 a year, Amazon said in a statement Wednesday. The Seattle-based e-commerce giant plans to offer a family-subscription plan later this year. The new offer will give Prime members access to a catalog of tens of millions of songs, up from about 2 million previously, Amazon said, and thousands of hand-curated playlists and personalized stations. Listening to music through the Echo voice-activated speaker was already one of the most popular features of the hit device.

Amazon is also offering an Echo-only subscription plan for $3.99 a month, providing access to all of the music catalog on a single device. The company is counting on the Echo, a surprise success when it was introduced two years ago, to help set its music offerings apart from those of established powerhouses and new entrants like Google. Music has always been an integral part of the Echo and Amazon is willing to lose money on a cheap offering to attract more shoppers to the device, with the ultimate goal of embedding all of its services more deeply in people's everyday lives. Amazon Echo. Credit: Amazon With the Echo, Alexa can be summoned to order a pizza, check the weather or, of course, buy items from Amazon. Available in three versions including the Dot and Tap, the Echo is central to Amazon's strategy for a connected home and as a way to boost membership in Amazon's Prime subscription program, which includes delivery discounts, video streaming and online photo storage. Amazon is betting that a stand-alone music streaming service will also enhance Echo's appeal to non-Prime members, ultimately whetting their appetites for further offerings from the online retailer. People who are happy with the music service are likely to upgrade and get the full benefits of Prime membership, making them more loyal to Amazon with their overall spending. Amazon introduced a stand-alone video subscription service in April, another potential gateway to Prime membership. The announcement from Amazon is also a boon for the music industry. The growth of subscription services has boosted music industry revenue for the past year and a half, offsetting declines in sales of physical and digital albums. U.S. streaming revenue grew 57% to $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016 and accounted for almost half of industry sales. Ad-supported streaming accounted for just 12% of that total. Record labels still aren't satisfied with their deals with many services, which they say offer too much for free. The labels have been pushing Spotify, the biggest streaming service, to limit some new releases to its paid tier, according to people familiar with the matter. Bringing in new competitors like Amazon could put more pressure on Spotify in negotiations. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Entertainment Mobile Music Podcasting Shopper Marketing Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Today Verizon said that that won’t be the case. Verizon says that the Pixel phones that it sells will get updates at the same time as the Pixels sold by Google. “When Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates),” Verizon told Ars Technica. “Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google.” Verizon also noted that the Pixels that it sells will be carrier unlocked and that, while there will be three Verizon apps preinstalled (Go90, My Verizon, and Verizon Message), all three can be uninstalled by the owner. When Google said that Verizon would control the system updates for its Pixels, many were concerned that updates would take longer to reach Verizon’s phones than they would Google’s phones. That’s because with the Galaxy Nexus, which was sold by Verizon and unlocked from Google, some updates took longer to hit the Verizon phone than they did the Google model. Verizon says that that won’t happen with the Pixels, though, and that the Pixel and Pixel XL will get updates at the same time as the Google versions, just like how all Apple iPhones get iOS updates at the same time. We’ll have to wait until the first Pixel update rolls out before we know if this will actually be the case, but Verizon’s statement does make its Pixels a bit more more attractive than they were before. Now that Verizon says that its Pixels will be updated at the same time as the Google models, are you thinking about getting a Verizon Pixel?

This means you, Galaxy Nexus. While in the past, a device with a carrier, (even a Nexus device), would get OS updates from Google later than their off-carrier counterparts. This was because of system-level apps from the carrier and an extra layer of consideration on the part of the carrier. Now that wont be a problem any longer. According to a Verizon spokesperson speaking to Ars Technica, the following will be true of the Pixel and Pixel XL in the near future: “First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google.” “Also, the Verizon version of the Google Pixel is carrier unlocked, so you can use it where ever you like. Finally, we have three apps pre-installed on the phone Go90, My Verizon (which is your account management tool) and Verizon Messages (your messaging app). As you noted, all three can easily be uninstalled by the user.” – Verizon Spokesperson Google also sent a message to Ars that reads as follows: “OS updates and monthly security patches will be updated on all Pixel devices (Verizon and non-Verizon versions) simultaneously.” – Google Representative So it would seem that Verizon is promising that, regardless of any certification that might need to take place, “users will get all updates at the same time as Google.” That includes both security updates and operating system updates. This seems to be a change from what was originally planned, as previous knowledge suggested that Google’s start-to-finish handling of updates would only work with security updates, while the OS would still need a certification step from Verizon. If that certification still needs to be done, it would seem that Verizon is promising that it wont have any effect on the speed at which the update reaches Pixel and Pixel XL users. With no system-level carrier apps in either the Pixel or the Pixel XL, it shouldn’t have been an issue – or at least an immediately apparent issue – for Google to essentially bypass Verizon to send out updates as such. It’s great to see that this seems to be the case in reality.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Verizon won’t ruin Google’s Pixel phones as badly as everyone thought Chris Smith BGR NewsOctober 12, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Verizon will be the exclusive carrier of Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL phones in the US, and up until now, we thought that might be a bad deal for any hardcore Android fans looking to always run Google’s latest operating system on their phones. Reports last week said that Verizon would preload some bloatware on the phones. They also said that Verizon, not Google, will be in charge of Android update releases. According to some new claims though, that might not be the case. DON’T MISS: This Galaxy S8 render might be so crazy you’ll forget all about the Note 7 Any Nexus user who purchased a device from Verizon probably knows that Verizon Nexus devices aren’t known for receiving speedy Android upgrades. And that’s even though Nexus handsets should always be able to run the latest Android release as soon as it’s available. However, contrary to last week’s reports, it would seem that Verizon won’t ruin the Pixel after all. Or at least, it won’t ruin Google’s phones completely. There may be bloatware preinstalled, but Verizon will roll out Android releases at the same time as Google. The news comes from Ars Technica’s Ron Amadeo, who heard it directly from Verizon. “Interesting,” he tweeted. “Just got a note from Verizon that its Pixels will “‘will get all updates at the same time as Google.’” https://twitter.com/RonAmadeo/status/786238183960932352 Google’s Pixels are already shaping up to be the best Android phones of the fall, especially considering the whole Galaxy Note 7 debacle. So if you care about quick Android updates and want to buy a Verizon Pixel or Pixel XL, you may be in luck. Otherwise, you could just purchase either phone directly from Google, which obviously guarantees that you’ll receive timely software updates.

Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize your pictures and video, and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. (AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) More NEW YORK (AP) -- If you're like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you've posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning" to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: ___ APPLE'S MEMORIES Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple's app created a "Florida to Illinois" package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a "Together" package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an "At The Beach" package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related." You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. ___ GOOGLE'S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical "GIF" animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called "Rediscover this day." Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you'll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. ___ SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Read More Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. ___ STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. ___ Online: Apple Memories video from January trip: https://youtu.be/dkm99o8tL88 Google animation of fountains: https://goo.gl/photos/p1iL9STfCmqhxxGx6 Google collage: https://goo.gl/photos/zkn1ZcLAPTqRQoJh7 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Here’s how the 4 top virtual reality systems stack up Yahoo Finance iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

It's an important type of memory that has been lacking in neural networks," he explained. Traditional neural networks are able to learn everything needed to find the fastest way through a transport system but they would have to be "fed" the data multiple times. "You can't give normal neural networks a piece of information and let them keep it indefinitely in their internal state – at some point it will be overwritten and they will essentially forget it," Graves said. The information in the neural network's memory could be kept "indefinitely".

A separate example saw the computer scientists input the details of a family tree and the AI answer whether a person was the 'aunt,' 'father,' or other relation of another. "Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are inaccessible to neural networks without external read–write memory," the authors, which include Deepmind's CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis, wrote in the paper. "Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data". ADVERTISEMENT Essentially, the neural network is being trained by a previous experience to solve a familiar problem. In an opinion article published alongside the research, Herbert Jaeger, a Jacobs University Bremen computer scientist, said the AI's memory allows it to reason.

Until now, he said, computers have only been able to achieve this by having a specific program written for them. The research has implications for big data if it can be scaled to handle the volume of large databases. "A flexible, extensible DNC-style working memory might allow deep learning to expand into big-data applications that have a rational reasoning component, such as generating video commentaries or semantic text analysis," Jaeger speculated.

Unlimited cloud storage for your photos…if you have the right phone Google’s new Pixel smartphone has Android fans excited. The sleek design, AMOLED screen and 12.3 megapixel camera (with an 8MP front-facing camera) are all tentpole features. The best part is that it doesn’t catch on fire like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. But where to put all those pictures, especially when you can shoot 4K video? “Smart Storage” is Google’s answer. Google offers free storage for full-resolution photos and videos you shoot with the Pixel. Don’t let unlimited cloud storage make you complacent, though! Keep a local backup of those pictures, then back up that hard drive with Backblaze. Google’s Pixel Smartphones come with free storage for full-res photos and videos Google muscles into the Mesh Wi-Fi market Finding spots in your home or office where your Wi-Fi doesn’t work? Does your internet connection slow way down or get unreliable in the bedroom or the family room? Wi-Fi “mesh” networks are an increasingly popular way to overcome such issues. Instead of one big Wi-Fi network router, smaller devices work together to broadcast a stronger network. Eero, Luma, Ubiquiti, and Linksys already play in this space. Now Google’s muscling in. Google Wifi comes with “Network Assist” technology to get you the best speed available. Better yet, it’s manageable through an Android and iOS smartphone app. Look for it to be available in the U.S. in time for the holidays starting at $199, with three packs for $299 – a lot cheaper than Eero’s offering. Introducing a new kind of Wi-Fi system Samsung marches on towards SSD/HD pricing parity Spinning hard disk drives continue to be the price per gigabyte leaders, but don’t expect that to last forever. Solid state drives (SSDs) continue to plummet in price as more companies and consumers demand the storage technology. Samsung says that by 2020, it’ll offer 512GB SSDs that will cost the same as a 1TB hard drive. We’re looking forward to the day we can build out a Backblaze Storage Pod with SSDs and not break the bank. Samsung expects 512GB SSDs to cost the same as a 1 TB HDD in 2020 CERN is running out of disk space for data from the LHC The Large Hadron Collider is running out of disk space. The world’s biggest particle accelerator is operating more efficiently and with better reliability than CERN scientists expected. That means a lot more data to collect. CERN researchers have short-changed themselves on the amount of storage they need to store and analyze all that data. Hey, CERN, give us a call – we’re be happy to help with B2 Cloud Storage!

Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize your pictures and video, and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. (AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — If you’re like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you’ve posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: Advertisement Continue reading ___ APPLE’S MEMORIES Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually … someday. Advertisement Continue reading ___ GOOGLE’S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Advertisement Continue reading ___ SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. ___ STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Advertisement Continue reading Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. ___ Online: Apple Memories video from January trip: https://youtu.be/dkm99o8tL88 Google animation of fountains: https://goo.gl/photos/p1iL9STfCmqhxxGx6 Google collage: https://goo.gl/photos/zkn1ZcLAPTqRQoJh7 Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Technology Suggested Stories: Review: Slick iOS 7 shines on Apple's new iPhones – Sep 11, 2013 Review: Refinements add up in new Mac system – Oct 23, 2013 Review: Google photo service is strong on search – Jul 23, 2015 Apple makes Siri smarter, rolls out software improvements – Jun 13, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Verizon Says It Won’t Delay Pixel Updates By Adnan Farooqui on 10/12/2016 10:03 PST Google announced its Pixel smartphones earlier this month. The new handsets are being sold unlocked and off-contract as you would expect but they are also available on Verizon exclusively in the United States. The Pixel handsets are similar to their Nexus predecessors in that they will receive software updates directly from Google. What about the units on Verizon? It was confirmed that Big Red would manage the system updates for those Pixel handsets and there was a fear that the carrier might delay updates as carriers normally do. Verizon has now said that it won’t do that with the Pixel. One of the main reasons why Nexus devices were so popular with a certain niche was because software updates always arrived on those devices first. OEMs and carriers tend to delay updates as they make their own tweaks and run their tests. A delay of more than a couple of months is normal so Pixel owners on Verizon would certainly have been curious about the update situation on Big Red. Verizon has clarified today that it’s not going to delay major updates for Pixel smartphones. In an official statement, the carrier says that Pixel smartphones on Verizon will get system updates “at the same time as Google.” This should put to bed any concerns about Verizon delaying updates for the Pixel. Whether or not that happens remains to be seen. Verizon is notorious for delaying updates even more so than its rivals so its customers will be skeptical. We’ll only come to know when system updates start going out for the Pixel once they are released. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Google, pixel and Verizon.

This 120 terabits per second submarine cable is going to connect Los Angeles with Hong Kong. They are working with Pacific Light Data Communication on this project which is a wholly owned subsidiary of China Soft Power Technology. The length of this cable will be an impressive 12,800 km. This project was first announced last year but back then Google and Facebook were not attached to it. The estimated cost of this project was said to be $400 million. The cable is going to have five fiber pairs each of which will have the capability to provide 24 Tbps of bandwidth. While it may seem unlikely, it’s actually not unusual at all for companies like Google and Facebook to team up on undersea cables. Facebook and Microsoft have already one such partnership for a trans-Atlantic cable. Companies taking part in this project will have their own portion of the cable, Google is going to keep its own fiber pair to ensure that its traffic remains private. It says that this new cable will bring greater bandwidth and lower latency to its customers in the APAC region. This will also be the case for Facebook users in the region. Filed in General.

Hannah Devlin Science correspondent @hannahdev Wednesday 12 October 2016 13.04 EDT Last modified on Thursday 13 October 2016 16.03 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger This article is 1 month old Google scientists have created a computer program that uses basic reasoning to learn to navigate the London Underground system by itself. The same Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent could also answer questions about the content of snippets of stories and work out family relationships by looking at a family tree. Scientists predict that in future a similar approach could pave the way for virtual assistants that would be able to instantaneously scour the internet to answer questions and carry out instructions with precision. Herbert Jaegar, a computer scientist at the University of Bremen, said: “I think this can be described as rational reasoning. They [the tasks] involve planning and structuring information into chunks and re-combining them.” Although the tasks themselves were fairly simple - a basic smartphone app can navigate a tube map - the way in which the program achieved its results is seen as impressive. It is one of the first programs to combine an external memory with an approach called deep-learning, in which the program learns how to do tasks independently rather than being pre-programmed with a set of rules by a human. Prof Geoff Hinton, a British scientist regarded as the father of deep learning, said the door was now open for deep learning to be applied to more complex tasks than many had originally thought possible. “Until very recently, it was far from obvious how deep learning could be used to allow a system to acquire the algorithms needed for conscious deliberate reasoning,” said Hinton, who works at the University of Toronto and Google. Deep learning has recently stormed ahead of other computing strategies in tasks like language translation, image and speech recognition and even enabled a computer to beat top-ranked player, Lee Sedol, at Go. However, until now the technique has generally performed poorly on any task where an overarching strategy is needed, such as navigation or extracting the actual meaning from a text. The latest program achieved this by adding an external memory, designed to temporarily store important pieces of information and fish them out when needed. The human equivalent of this is working memory, a short-term repository in the brain that allows us to stay on task when doing something that involves several steps, like following a recipe. Alex Graves, the research scientist at Google DeepMind in London who led the work, said that the work marked an incremental step towards smart machines, rather than a sudden departure. “I’m wary of saying now we have a machine that can reason,” he said. “We have something that has an improved memory - a different kind of memory that we believe is a necessary component of reasoning. It’s hard to draw a line in the sand.” In the study, published in the journal Nature, the program was able to find the quickest route between underground stops and work out where it would end up if it travelled, say, two stops north from Victoria station. It was also given story snippets, such as “John is in the playground. John picked up the football.” followed by the question “Where is the football?” and was able to answer correctly, hinting that in future assistants such Apple’s Siri may be replaced by something more sophisticated. Graves said that while the story tasks “look so trivial to a human that they don’t seem like questions at all,” existing computer programs “do really badly on this”. The program he developed got questions like this right 96% of the time. Jaegar said that the latest effort by DeepMind should be viewed as “just one hop forward in what should be described as a stampede” of rapidly unfolding developments in AI, adding that the abilities of computers would not necessarily be restricted to logical tasks such as navigation in future. “Why should there be an inherent limit? Everything that a brain can do is possible with a physical system,” he said. “They [computers] will come closer to performance and are already even better on some things. It’s a matter of time and of funding: whether anyone will be willing to spend the necessary millions to develop these things.” A number of high profile scientists have warned about the existential threat posed by AI, with Stephen Hawking cautioning that “once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate”. But Demis Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind has previously played down such concerns. “We’re decades away from any sort of technology that we need to worry about,” Hassabis said last year.

By Andy Wolber | October 12, 2016, 8:28 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic According to reports, Duo, Google's new video calling app, will soon replace Hangouts as a required app installed on new Android devices with access to the Google Play Store. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter Yet Hangouts, as one of the core G Suite apps, remains far more useful than Duo in the enterprise. Hangouts supports SMS, integrates Google Voice calling, and syncs your conversations across multiple devices. If your organization uses Hangouts, you'll likely want to stick with Hangouts for the foreseeable future. If you're a G Suite administrator, that means you'll need to change your deployment practices to install Hangouts on new Android devices. You could just ask each person who gets a new Android device to install Hangouts. Or, you could manually install and configure Hangouts on every new Android device. Instead, I recommend that G Suite administrators install Hangouts as one of the apps deployed automatically to every new Android device that connects to G Suite. If you haven't yet configured G Suite for a mobile device management solution, the following steps will allow an administrator to deploy apps to Android devices. To set this up, you'll need to be a super administrator for your G Suite domain, and you'll need some time to review and configure the following settings. 1. Notify Android users Before you get started, let your Android users know that you'll be deploying a new mobile management solution. (Google gives you a sample email to send.) Also, ask people to download the G Suite Device Policy app. 2. Set Google as your enterprise mobility management (EMM) provider. Login to your G Suite Admin console (http://admin.google.com). Go to Device management > Setup > EMM binding for Android. Choose "Bind Google Mobile Management as your EMM provider for Android devices." You'll need to review and agree to Android Management terms of service. Once activated, you should receive a notice in the Admin console, and via email, that Android for Work mobility management is available. SEE: Power checklist: Managing and troubleshooting mobile devices (Tech Pro Research) 3. Setup Mobile Management Return to the Admin console > Device management > Setup Mobile Management and check the box under Android Sync to "Manage Android devices." Select "Save." Google suggests that the change may take up to a day to fully deploy. I also recommend that you go to Device management > Android Settings > Work Profile and change the drop-down option from "User opt-in" to "Enforce." If the device operating system supports it (Android 5.0+ or more recent), this will create a Work folder, which will hold Google Play for Work apps. An administrator may choose and approve apps to deploy to Android devices connected to your G Suite domain. Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic 4. Manage Applications for Android devices Next, return to your Admin console > Device management > App management (in the lower left menu) > Manage Applications for Android devices. With Android Management enabled, you can choose apps to deploy to users within your domain. Choose the "Click here to manage" option. Initially, you'll see only the "G Suite Device Policy" app listed. You can add additional Android apps to this list. Open a new browser tab and go to http://play.google.com/work. The first time you open the Google Play for Work store, you'll need to accept the terms of service. After that's done, search the Play for Work store for Hangouts. (IMPORTANT: Note that this is not the consumer-facing Google Play store link.) Once you're on the Hangouts app page, choose "Approve" to allow the app. Then, copy the page link. Find the app you want in http://play.google.com/work, then: 1) Approve it, 2) Copy the app URL, and 3) Paste the URL in the Whitelist Android App field, then select "Get App." Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic Return to the "Device Management > App Management > Whitelisted Android Apps" page. Choose the action button in the lower right to add an app. Paste the link to the app, then select "Get App." Then choose to "Automatically install on all devices" as well as whether to allow people to remove the app. If you use Hangouts as your organization's official messaging app, I recommend you select both options: To auto-install and prevent removal. Select "Whitelist" when complete. Select whether to auto-install an app, and whether users may remove it. Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic 5. Ask users to open the Device Policy app Finally, ask your Android users to open the Device Policy app. They'll need to login with their G Suite email address and password, then accept mobile device management terms that allow administrative access to the device. One logged in, the user can create a work profile. (Open the Device Policy app, then tap "Create Work Profile.") A work profile creates a folder with work contacts, the Google Play Store for Work, and the Device Policy app. The user will need to tap the Google Play Store in the Work folder and accept terms of service there, too. After that, whitelisted apps from the Play Store for Work will be available. If you set Hangouts to auto-install, it will now do so. The Device Policy app can create a work profile on your Android device to keep your work apps and data separate from the personal information on your device. Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic Setting up a work profile keeps work apps and data separated from personal apps and data. Should a G Suite administrator ever need to remotely erase the device, only work data would be removed—all of the user's personal apps, files, and pictures should remain untouched. SEE: Mobile Device Research: 2016 security trends, attack rates, and vendor ratings for smartphones, tablets, laptops and wearables (Tech Pro Research) Deploy other apps, too Once completed, you'll have successfully deployed Hangouts to all Android devices connected to your G Suite domain. Repeat the connection process for every new Android device, and they'll all still have Hangouts—even if the device arrives without it. You can also approve or auto-install other Android apps, too. Just repeat the process in step 4 for each app you want to add. Approving an app allows users to manually find and install the app from the Google Play Store for Work. Whitelisting and configuring an app to auto-install, as we did with Hangouts above, will make the app automatically appear in the Work folder on your users' connected Android devices.

The company’s new Pixel smartphones already come with Android 7.1 out of the box and Google has now confirmed that it has scheduled the Android 7.1 beta release for later this month. The beta will be released for Nexus devices that are compatible with Nougat. It hasn’t provided a confirmed release date yet, only that it will be out at some point in October. Android 7.1 beta release has been confirmed for the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, and the Pixel C tablet. As previously mentioned, the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will already be running the first major update for Nougat when they are released on October 20th. It’s likely that beta builds will be released once the handsets start shipping. The Pixel smartphones also have some software features that are exclusive to the lineup. The features include Pixel Camera, Pixel Launcher, and Google Assistant. Even though Assistant is meant to be a Pixel exclusive, there is a method to enable it on any device running Android 7.0 Nougat. Android 7.1 beta release will bring features like Night Light, support for Daydream VR, as well as improvements to display and touch responsiveness. Google is yet to confirm when it’s looking to release Android 7.1 Nougat to all supported devices. Hopefully, it will confirm the beta release date in the near future. Filed in Cellphones.

Last week, Google revealed that although it's handling software and security updates for the devices, Verizon must certify them for carrier-sold Pixels before they can be rolled out to customers. That at least raised the possibility that Verizon-sold Pixel phones might not get new Android features as soon as they're available for the Pixels that Google sells directly. But a very straightforward statement that Verizon gave to Ars Technica seems to eliminate any potential concern. (Emphasis added by The Verge.) First and foremost, all operating system and security updates to the Pixel devices will happen in partnership with Google. In other words, when Google releases an update, Verizon phones will receive the same update at the same time (much like iOS updates). Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google. Also, the Verizon version of the Google Pixel is carrier unlocked, so you can use it where ever you like. Finally, we have three apps pre-installed on the phone Go90, My Verizon (which is your account management tool) and Verizon Messages (your messaging app). As you noted, all three can easily be uninstalled by the user. There's a lot of good stuff in that statement that should relieve people planning on buying a Pixel from Verizon next week. First, Verizon is stating directly that it will not "stand in the way" of Google's updates. Somewhat remarkably, the carrier says the arrangement between both companies is similar to Apple's complete control over iOS software releases. That's not a comparison we've ever heard Verizon make about updates from Samsung, LG, Motorola, and other Android phone makers. Second, the Pixel and Pixel XL will be unlocked for use on other networks — just like the other smartphones that Verizon sells. And third, it sounds as if the three — just three! — preloaded apps can be uninstalled by users. Hopefully that's true and Verizon isn't talking about merely disabling them, which isn't quite the same as removing the apps entirely. Either way, it's hard to read this any other way: Verizon is pledging that Google's Pixel and Pixel XL won't fall behind when it comes to future Android updates. Does that make you more confident in purchasing from a Verizon store instead of Google come October 20th?

In updated version you will see a label that indicates a page is AMP'd. This doesn't change Search results but will show you which sites have pages that are ready to load lightning fast. AMP also helps save data as AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. Today, the median time it takes for an AMP page to load from Google Search is less than one second. Over the last year, since the AMP project started, over 600 million AMP documents, in over 104 languages have been created worldwide. In India, several publishers have embraced AMP. Zomato specifically has seen great early results since AMPing their pages, with page load times decreasing from 3.8 seconds to well under a second. In terms of global impact, the Washington Post has seen a 23 percent increase in mobile search users who return within seven days, and an 88 percent improvement in load time for AMP content versus traditional mobile web. eBay, Pinterest, Wordpress, and Reddit, are among many other publishers worldwide who have adopted AMP and are benefiting from web pages that load much faster. Slow loading sites are arguably one of the most frustrating things about the mobile web. Recent Google research shows that 53 percent of people will leave a site that fails to load in three seconds or less. In addition to the wide adoption of AMP, over the last year Google has also launched several enhancements for AMP including the "Top Stories" section of Google Search, delivering news in a fast and reliable way. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in September 1998. Since then, the company has grown to more than 50,000 employees worldwide, with a wide range of popular products and platforms like Search, Maps, Ads, Gmail, Android, Chrome, and YouTube.

(Andrew Burton/Getty Images) BY Lisa L. Colangelo NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, October 12, 2016, 12:02 PM Thousands of city kids can explore a future in computer science with hands-on activities at the NYC Geek Street Fair on Thursday in Union Square Park. The event, hosted by Google, is designed to get youngsters excited about science, technology, engineering and math — known as STEM. It brings together technology companies, community-based organizations, museums and content creators. Last year's fair in Manhattan's Meatpacking District drew more than 3,000 kids. Organizers expect those numbers to grow with the more central Union Square location. Participants can watch a Minecraft robot create structures and try to construct their own using JavaScript, discover light-up origami design with illuminated paper creatures and learn to hone their STEM skills through golf — along with other activities. Makey Makey lights up kids' minds at Google Geek Street Fair The fair runs from noon to 5 p.m. and is free and open to the public.  Groups are encouraged to register on the event's webpage.

The magazine, which recently threw in the towel on nudity as part of an effort to reach a broader audience, made its debut on the iTunes and Google Play stores. "Since introducing a brand new vision for Playboy magazine earlier this year, we have expanded our distribution channels in many powerful ways, including higher visibility on an increased number of traditional and digital media platforms," said David Israel, chief operating officer and chief financial officer of Playboy Enterprises. Playboy, which recently threw in the towel on nudity as part of an effort to reach a broader audience, is making its debut on the iTunes and Google Play stores ©Mandel Ngan (AFP/File) "Inclusion in the iTunes and Google Play stores is an important milestone for Playboy as we continue to explore opportunities to introduce our content to new audiences all over the world." Playboy, which broke lifestyle taboos in the 1950s with bare-breasted pictures in a magazine for the mass market, unveiled "a top-to-bottom redesign" starting with its March 2016 edition. Facing a deluge of online pornography, Playboy shifted its focus in a bid to offer lifestyle content that is "safe for work" and more widely distributed on social media. Playboy still includes provocative pictorials of women, but without nudity, a major turnabout for the magazine which launched in 1953 with an edition featuring Marilyn Monroe. The magazine also gained fame for its interviews of major public figures from Jimmy Carter to Fidel Castro, and fiction from writers including Vladimir Nabokov, Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood.

The fiber-optic cable will have a bandwidth of 120 terabits per second, which Google says makes it the highest-capacity route between the US and Asia. It’ll double the current record, which is held by a cable that Google is also a partner on. The new cable should allow Google and Facebook to offer faster and more reliable service to visitors on the other side of the Pacific. The companies will likely each get a certain chunk of the cable’s total capacity and lease out the remaining space to others; but so far, they haven’t announced the specifics. Facebook has partnered on an even faster cable across the Atlantic These undersea cables are increasingly being built in partnership with big tech companies as those big tech companies come to represent more and more of the internet’s traffic. Facebook and Google both have plenty of data to send just between their own servers, so there’s reason they’d want to have a stake in the connections, rather than being forced to lease everything they need. Facebook, for instance, recently partnered with Microsoft to build an even faster cable across the Atlantic. And for Google, this’ll be the sixth cable it’s taken an ownership stake in. The cable is being called the Pacific Light Cable Network and is expected to be completed and running sometime in 2018. More From The Verge What does a Trump presidency mean for climate change?

While the recently-announced Pixel handsets will ship with their own version of Android 7.1 (including Google Assistant), this iterative update will eventually be made available to Nexus and other phones. The most obvious new feature for end users is new support for GIFs and animations within the keyboard. Google says the Android keyboard will be able to interact with third-party apps to create and apply stickers, videos, and other expressive content. Android 7.1 also adopts a 3D Touch-style interactive tool that will let people access up to five secondary actions/settings that can be reached directly from the launcher. What’s in Android 7.1? Android 7.1 delivers the productivity, security, and performance of Android 7.0, along with a variety of optimizations and bug fixes, features, and new APIs (API level 25). For developers, Android 7.1 adds new capabilities to help you drive engagement in your app and deliver an improved user experience, such as: App shortcuts API — lets you surface key actions directly in the launcher and take your users deep into your app instantly. You can create up to 5 shortcuts, either statically or dynamically. Circular app icons support — lets you provide great-looking rounded icon resources that match the look of Pixel and other launchers. Enhanced live wallpaper metadata — lets you provide metadata about your live wallpapers to any picker displaying the wallpapers as a preview. You can show existing metadata such as label, description, and author, as well as a new context URL and title to link to more information. Android 7.1 also adds these much-requested developer features to the platform: Image keyboard support — expands the types of content that users can enter from their keyboards, letting them express themselves through custom stickers, animated gifs, and more. Apps can tell the keyboard what types of content they accept, and keyboards can deliver all of the images and other content that they offer to the user. For broad compatibility, this API will also be available in the support library. Storage manager Intent — lets an app take the user directly to a new Settings screen to clear unused files and free up storage space on the device. For carriers and calling apps, the platform includes new APIs to support multi-endpoint calling and new telephony configuration options. Another tool called storage manager intent allows users to quickly access apps' memory settings to clear out unwanted or old files. Android 7.1 gives developers several new functions, as well, including the ability to adopt the Pixels' round app icons, and glean more data from active wallpapers. Google says it will release a developer preview off Android 7.1 in the near future to the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, and Pixel C. The updated platform bumps up the API level to 25 and developers will have to adjust their apps accordingly. Google expects to release Android 7.1 to a wide range of devices, including more Nexus handsets, in the months ahead. Get your apps ready Android 7.1 is an incremental release, but it’s always important to make sure your apps look and run great — especially as devices start to reach consumers. The Android 7.1 Developer Preview will give you everything you need to test your apps or extend them with new features like shortcuts or keyboard images. Included are the SDK with new APIs, build tools, documentation and samples, as well as emulators and device system images for running your apps on supported Nexus devices. We’ll also include a launcher and apps that support app shortcuts, and a keyboard and apps that support keyboard images. If you want to receive the Developer Preview automatically, visit Android Beta and enroll your device. If you previously enrolled a device and haven’t unenrolled, your device will receive the update. If you already enrolled but don’t want to receive the update, visit Android Beta to unenroll the device as soon as possible. Initially, we’ll offer the Developer Preview for Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C devices, extending to other supported devices by the end of the preview. At the final release of the Android 7.1.x platform, due in early December, we’ll roll out updates to the full lineup of supported devices — Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9, Player, Pixel C, and supported Android One devices — as well as Pixel and Pixel XL devices. Coming to consumer devices soon We’re working with our partners to bring Android 7.1 to devices in the ecosystem over the months ahead, so we recommend downloading the Android 7.1 Developer Preview as soon as it’s available. Test your apps for compatibility and optimize them to look their best, such as by providing circular app icons and adding app shortcuts. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ...

Quote: Originally Posted by StewieTech Cyanogenmod voids warraties but its worth it Yeah, this. Now if it had a Smart Stay implementation in CM13 I'd be perfectly happy with it. What also irritates me is that they forgot to add the quick PIN feature on the lock screen. I have to press enter every time after inputting my PIN ugh. Either way, I've been sitting on CM for the past 2 years on my S5. I don't regret voiding my warranty one bit, touchwiz may have nice features but it's terribly bloated. Cyanogenmod + the S series having really good build quality and hardware is a killer combo. Speaking of which, since Samsung is doing all they can to lock, encrypt and generally have sex with the bootloaders in their phones, I probably won't go for Samsung again. Android stands for an open environment, Samsung is not respecting that. If I wanted a walled garden I'd have thrown my money at Apple.

Dvorak October 12, 2016 10 Comments Google's plan for a new OS is a fantastic idea, but one it will never pull off. Recent rumors suggest that Google is working on a new OS, dubbed Andromeda, which will be compatible with Chrome and Android apps. On the surface it should become a universal replacement for macOS, Windows, Chrome OS, Android, Windows Phone 10, iOS, Linux, and more. I'm skeptical, though; just look at Google Glass or the screwball (pun intended) Nexus Q. Let's explain the Google problem. The company's main revenue stream is advertising generated via search, the success of which allows other departments to fiddle around with so-called moonshots. This makes Google a great place to work—as long as the cash cow keeps generating cash. Very few moonshots become cash cows. But there are remarkable inventions and ideas that Google continues to pursue. This includes the book scanning of the world's libraries, the on-going development of Google Maps and Street View, the autonomous car, Google Fiber, and the Android phone OS. If there was ever a serious economic downturn you have to wonder what Google would do to these expensive projects and what it would do to its workforce to re-focus on the search engine cash cow. My guess it that it would not be fun to watch. This exposure is compounded by the overall company secretiveness. Ian Thompson of the Register, for example, mentioned on a podcast that Google would let him ride in an autonomous vehicle but he couldn't write about it. It's all very Steve Jobs, and does prevent competitors from poaching employees. But it can also result in bungles because an objective third eye can catch blunders missed by rank-and-file employees who are often afraid to rock the boat. I'm reminded of Texas Instruments and the 1979 episode involving the rollout of the TI 99/4 Home Computer. In short: Texas Instruments decided it was going into the home computer business. Rumors about its new killer computer were rampant, but nobody knew anything because TI kept everything under wraps. That included the media, many of whom were also hobbyists. When it arrived, TI's machine had no control key, slash key, or question mark key. It was unbelievable. The company had to dump millions of machines at $99 to get rid of them. The entire thing was a fiasco. //Related Articles The Best Chromebooks of 2016 Google has similar tendencies. I've been advocating for a new OS for probably a decade or more, but I lost faith in the company when it developed its cloud-based Chrome OS, which was no replacement for Windows. Google was active in 1998 and grew during the era of Windows 98, Windows ME, and then Windows 2000. For years, it had to see the vulnerability of Microsoft to a frontal attack. It had all the time in the world to take on Windows in a real way, but what did we get? Chrome OS—something that relies on an Internet connection and is essentially smart terminal software circa 1970. Even the thought of Andromeda is too little, too late; it promises to be another Nexus Q. Back to top Previous : Freedom Takes Another Blow From Apple, Microsoft By John C.

Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Scene More Biz Music Legit Jobs Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition: U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe Home Digital News Virtual Reality in Depth: Inside Google’s Quest to Bring Back 3D Video (EXCLUSIVE) Janko Roettgers Senior Silicon Valley Correspondent @jank0 2 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Print Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Google October 12, 2016 | 09:00AM PT It all started with a 3D-printed piece of plastic, zip ties and a bunch of masking tape: Google’s Seattle-based computer vision team seemed to channel MacGyver when it began to experiment with capturing 3D video in the fall of 2014, testing out a bunch of different camera setups put together in the form of janky rigs. Two years later, the results of those early trials have led to JUMP, Google’s 3D video capture and production platform. JUMP is just one part of Google’s efforts to popularize virtual reality; the company also introduced a low-cost VR headset dubbed Daydream View alongside its new phones last week. One of the fist prototypes of Google’s JUMP camera. Photo courtesy of Google Here’s how these pieces fit together: Daydream wants to get people to use VR. JUMP aims to make it VR more immersive, thanks to the power of 3D, while also lowering production costs to the point where many more content producers can shoot 3D video. “Before this, stereo 360 was entirely for high-end visual effects studios,” said JUMP technical lead Sameer Agarwal during a recent interview with Variety. 3D Is Back, Thanks to Virtual Reality Let’s face it: 3D has become a bit of a dirty word for both Hollywood and consumers. Just a few years ago, the movie industry tied its hopes for the survival of home video to 3D, betting that the excitement for 3D blockbusters would translate to the living room. But 3D TVs largely flopped because of a lack of consumer interest, relegating 3D effects to theaters and big Hollywood blockbusters. Related How Google Is Tricking Us All to Embrace Virtual Reality But with growing interest in VR headsets, 3D is getting a kind of second chance — albeit with a very different twist. There are some technical differences to the way 3D works in theaters, on 3D TVs and on VR headsets, but the bigger change is how content creators are using 3D. In VR, 3D is being used as a much more subtle effect to add to the overall sense of immersion — something that neither a TV screen nor a big theater can provide. Headsets can put viewers in the middle of a refugee camp, on a beach or in a jungle, and make them feel like they’re really there, thanks to the ability to take charge and look around on their own pace. But while computer-generated imagery has long offered 3D experiences in VR, most 360-degree videos are still shot in 2D. Watching them in a headset feels like sitting in a round room without corners, with a movie playing on the entire wall-space. The science behind Google’s JUMP cameras Stereoscopic 3D adds depth to this experience by emulating the way human vision works: By relying on images from two eyes with slightly different vantage points, the human mind adds depth to what it sees. However, the JUMP team found out quickly that capturing 3D with video cameras for VR was rather tricky. Our eyes can add 3D depth to anything around us because we can simply turn our head. Video cameras on the other hand have to be static, pointing towards a set direction — especially if the resulting video is supposed to allow viewers to explore a scene freely, instea of directing them where to look. VR video producers sometimes use wide angle lenses for 2D 360 degree videos, but these lenses don’t offer the same sense of depth, and can add distortion around the edges. Adding many more cameras to make up for different perspectives would wouldn’t have been economic, if only for the reason that each and every camera captures huge amounts of data. That’s why Google’s JUMP team relied on science instead. Google’s JUMP emulates the way humans perceive 3D by combining 16 GoPro cameras with an infinite number of “virtual” camera instances. Photo courtesy of Google Researching cutting-edge algorithms for 3D still photography, they realized that they could simply arrange a set number of cameras in a circle, and have computers simulate an infinite number virtual cameras that would fill in to allow omni-directional 3D video capture. (For the technically inclined: This is called Omnidirectional Stereo Projection, and the JUMP team will be presenting a research paper about their work in this field at Siggraph Asia in December.) The team even developed a formula to find out how many real cameras it needed for any given circle size, 3D depth effect and the field of view of particular camera models. It’s complex math, but led them to realize that it was actually fairly simple to build capture hardware with an array of 16 GoPro cameras, which happened to already have the optimal field-of-view. “We were kind of lucky with that,” said Agarwal. Google’s Cloud to the rescue The next step was to build the computing backend to make sense of the data from those 16 cameras. Google’s JUMP assembler doesn’t simply stitch their videos together, but instead interpolates imagery from those “virtual” cameras. Add color correction and other automated editing functionality, and you end up with a pretty time-intensive process. “It’s more than 4000 times slower than real time,” explained Agarwal. On a normal desktop computer, processing of just one hour of JUMP video would take months. Google is instead letting JUMP users upload their footage to the cloud, where numerous servers churn away on it at the same time. Processing an hour of JUMP footage with 1000 cores in the cloud takes merely 10 hours. A side effect of this approach is that all of the stitching is being automated, which is not always the case with other VR video production environments. Wired for example used to have seven people on staff to do stitching work for VR and 360-degree videos, said Agarwal. “They are doing something else now.” The cloud-centric approach also means that JUMP is a bit of a black box. Producers shoot their footage with a JUMP camera rig, and use a Mac application to upload the video files from each of the 16 cameras. Then, Google’s servers take over and turn all the source footage into a 3D VR video. Some hours later, the video is available for download, and producers can trim it, or do color correction for some final touches. Some studios may decide that this doesn’t give them enough control; but the flip side of letting Google’s servers do all of this is that it significantly lowers the barrier of entry for 3D video. Sure, big production studios could feasibly also do similar things with a huge server park, admitted Agarwal. But that would be a mistake, he argued. “If this system is only available to people who have a cluster at their disposal, then we are not doing our job.” What’s next for JUMP Google first showed off a JUMP camera prototype dubbed Odyssey at its Google I/O developer conference in 2015, and started to ship first JUMP rigs to select partners soon after. It also equipped YouTube’s production studios in Los Angeles, New York, London and Tokyo with JUMP cameras, and JUMP partners like GoPro, the Atlantic and the AP have since shot dozens of videos with the platform. Agarwal said that a huge part of his team’s work over the past few months has been to learn from these partners. “We are not filmmakers,” he acknowledged. Learning how JUMP is being used in the field, and what matters to producers, helped a lot, he said, with image quality being one of the key areas of future improvements. JUMP partners also kept bringing up another issue, which Google is likely going to solve sooner or later: The current camera rigs only shoot omnidirectional video horizontally. Look up straight in any JUMP video, and you’ll only get to see a blurry spot that was out of reach for the rig’s camera lenses. But more than anything, the next chapter of JUMP may be to scale up production. Google’s cooperation with GoPro on the existing JUMP Odyssey camera rig was little more than a test case, with the number of rigs in the wild being somewhere north of a hundred. In May, Google announced new partnerships with Chinese camera maker YiYi as well as iMax to produce additional JUMP rigs. It’s unlikely that these efforts will result in a cheap consumer camera any time soon, but making them available to many more producers could be enough to kick off a true 3D renaissance.

However, Now might not entirely be overshadowed as a new widget that shows notifications under the search bar is currently being A/B tested. Screenshots from Reddit user navjot94 show a new Widget section in the Settings of the Google app. Enabling it shows “commute, weather, and local information in the Google widget.” Specifically, information that would normally trigger a notification now shows up just underneath the search bar on the homescreen. For instance, weather alerts include exactly the same icon and text that usually appear in the notification shade. Like a notification, users have the ability to tap in order to see more or dismiss it. The text underneath the search bar likely pushes down app icons and other widgets on the homescreen. With people receiving more and more notifications, information appearing right on the homescreen is a useful method to make sure people see important, time sensitive information. This widget is likely being A/B tested among a very small group of people as using the beta version of the Google app does not guarantee its appearance.

Node.js changed all this and turned JavaScript into a server side language that is used in really big projects.  The current solution to managing the thousands of available JavaScript packages is npm the client for which is automatically included with Node.js. Facebook developers working on big projects like React found that working with the npm client just didn't scale to the number of programmers and the number of packages. The solution was to get together with Google, Exponent and Tilde and build a new npm client - which is what Yarn is.    So what is different about Yarn?  The Facebook blog post introducing it says: In the Node ecosystem, dependencies get placed within a node_modules directory in your project. However, this file structure can differ from the actual dependency tree as duplicate dependencies are merged together. The npm client installs dependencies into the node_modules directory non-deterministically. This means that based on the order dependencies are installed, the structure of anode_modules directory could be different from one person to another. These differences can cause “works on my machine” bugs that take a long time to hunt down. Yarn resolves these issues around versioning and non-determinism by using lockfiles and an install algorithm that is deterministic and reliable. These lockfiles lock the installed dependencies to a specific version, and ensure that every install results in the exact same file structure in node_modulesacross all machines. The written lockfile uses a concise format with ordered keys to ensure that changes are minimal and review is simple. That a package manager should implement deterministic installs seems to be the least you could ask, but it seems that the npm client isn't deterministic.  Yarn might use the npm registry to get packages but once you have retrieved a package it is cached. This means you can install it locally without having to have an Internet connection and slowly your dependence on the npm registry is decreased.    The irony is that to install Yarn you have to use the npm client, which it then replaces - reminiscent of the idea that the only use of IE is to install another browser. However, there is a serious issue here. It isn't clear if Yarn has the potential to replace or be a fork of the npm registry. At the moment Yarn accesses the registry as supplied by Npmjs.com, but it doesn't authenticate and so cannot work with private packages. The registry hosts private packages for around $7 per month per programmer; only the hosting and downloading of open source packages is free. It is clear that at some time in the future a Yarn spin-off (pun attempted) could setup a private package facility of its own.   More Information https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360/yarn-a-new-package-manager-for-javascript/ Related Articles Node.js v6 Released  Node.js Foundation Releases First Joint Code  Getting Started with Node.js      To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.    Atom Asks About Telemetry 18/10/2016  An updated version of Atom has been released just five weeks after Atom 1.10 was released. Atom 1.11 offers a number of improvements to the text editor. + Full Story \\No Comment - Influence of Pokémon Go on Physical Activity & The Statistical Mechanics of Human Weight Change 31/10/2016 • Influence of Pokémon Go on Physical Activity • The Statistical Mechanics of Human Weight Change + Full Story More News Microsoft Student Contests Emphasize Azure Rovables - Wearables That Crawl All Over You Get Involved With AI XPrize Taking Code to the Classroom Microsoft Ditches Fitness Band SDK Reversible PHP Debugger Released Jumpstart Your Career In Game Development With Udemy SQLite 3.15 Adds Row Value Support ActiveState Extends to Ruby, Node.js, Go and Lua European Astro Pi Challenge //No Comment - Thonny IDE 2.0, VisualVM Updated & XTREE Code Reorganization //No Comment - CSS, Social Media & Fourier Transform Microsoft C++/WinRT   Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Last Updated ( Wednesday, 12 October 2016 )     Follow @Iprogrammerinfo     RSS feed of news items only Copyright © 2016 i-programmer.info.

How Key Features of Google Pixel, Apple iPhone 7 Stack Up As the fight for smartphone market share continues, we compare the latest handsets from Apple and Google and discuss the major similarities and differences between them. Which Operating System Do Customers Want? The Pixel and iPhone 7 come with the latest versions of their creators' mobile operating systems. On the iPhone side, users will find iOS 10, an operating system with enhanced Siri support, an improved Messages experience and rich notifications. The Google Pixel comes with Android's Nougat, which also has improved notifications and a nice design. Both operating systems are widely viewed as substantial improvements over last year's options. The Designs Should Be Considered The iPhone 7 and Google Pixel come with similar designs. Both devices are thin and have curved corners. However, the fingerprint sensor on the Pixel is on the back. On the iPhone 7, users will find the Touch ID sensor on the front below the screen. Both smartphones come with a metal body and mechanical buttons. Overall, both the iPhone 7 and Pixel are nice-looking handsets. Choose a Display Size It's important to draw some distinctions between screen size in the Pixel and iPhone 7. Apple's smartphone comes in two flavors, featuring 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens. The Pixel also has a 5.5-inch version, but its base model has a slightly larger screen, measuring 5 inches. Google has been quick to point out that distinction in its attempt at appealing to consumers and enterprise users. Consider the Carrier Options Apple's iPhone 7 is available to just about anyone. The smartphone is supported by all four major carriers in the United States, and customers can buy the unlocked model to put it on the network of their choosing. Google, however, has formed an exclusive partnership with Verizon, which will sell the smartphone in its stores. But, for those who don't want a Verizon-locked phone, Google is offering an unlocked version that can be used on other networks. Google Trumpets Unlimited Storage Google is offering free unlimited storage of photos and videos through its cloud-based servers. The move places the Pixel in stark contrast to the iPhone 7, which stores content locally. Users can also store their photos and videos in the cloud, but they need to pay a monthly fee for iCloud storage. Heavy picture-takers who want to save a little cash and storage, in other words, could benefit from owning a Pixel. How Important Is the Headphone Jack? If customers want a headphone jack, they'll need to buy the Google Pixel. In a move that surprised some, Apple shipped the iPhone 7 without a headphone jack, and users need an adapter that connects through the smartphone's Lightning port to use wired headphones. The Pixel, however, comes with a headphone jack, making it quite literally plug and play. Various App Options Available Software could prove to be a selling point for some customers. On the Google side, the Pixel offers support for the company's virtual reality service Daydream, as well as its virtual personal assistant Google Assistant. Users will also find Chrome, YouTube and other Google apps built in. The iPhone 7 comes with several Apple apps, including Maps, iTunes, Apple Music and Podcasts, among several others. An Eye on the Fisheye Both Apple and Google stake claim to the best smartphone camera on the market. Apple's iPhone 7 has a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization. The larger iPhone 7 Plus offers two cameras to suppose wide-angle and telephoto shots. The Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel rear-facing camera and f/2.0 aperture for bright photos. Its large pixel support also works well in low-light conditions. Compare the Battery Life The Pixel comes with better battery life than the iPhone 7. According to Google, the smaller model can last for 26 hours of continuous cellular talk time and 13 hours of video playback. Those figures go up to 32 hours and 14 hours, respectively, on the larger version. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus can last for 14 hours and 21 hours, respectively, during continuous cellular talk time. Video playback lasts 13 hours on iPhone 7 and 14 hours on iPhone 7 Plus. Get the Right Price The Google Pixel and iPhone 7 start at the same price: $649. However, those who want a larger screen or more storage will pay a higher price on both models. The bigger Google Pixel with additional storage, for instance, goes for $869. Apple's top-of-the-line 256GB iPhone 7 tops out at $969. For $869, iPhone 7 customers will get the same screen size and storage amount as the bigger Pixel. 10 Features Samsung Should Build Into the Galaxy S8 Smartphone View Slideshow » Why DNS Servers Are an Unprotected Back Door into Your Network View Slideshow » 11 Revolutionary Advances in Wireless Tech in 2016 View Slideshow » Panasonic Updates Toughpad FZ-G1 With More Power, Longer Battery Life View Slideshow » Broadcom, Qualcomm Latest Acquirers in Busy Chip Space View Slideshow » Why Donald Trump and Silicon Valley Don't See Eye to Eye View Slideshow » CIOs Expect Steady Growth in Health Care IT Spending, Cyber-Threats View Slideshow » Ransomware Takes Off, Web Browsers Under Attack: Kaspersky Report View Slideshow » TrueOS Succeeds PC-BSD Desktop-Friendly Unix OS View Slideshow » Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro View Slideshow » View All Slideshows >   The battle for smartphone supremacy is on between Apple and Google. On Oct. 4, Google announced its new Pixel smartphone, the first to be designed and engineered by the company. The Pixel comes with the customer's choice of a 5-inch or 5.5-inch display, a refined design and Google's latest Android Nougat operating system. At its core, the Pixel is a high-end smartphone designed to take on Apple. In fact, Google referred to Apple's iPhone during its Pixel unveiling, discussing its smartphone's unlimited storage. In interviews about the Pixel, the company also pointed to similarities between Apple and Google's design and engineering process to show customers the search giant is ready to take on the hardware giant. Given that, it's perhaps a good time to compare the latest and greatest smartphones from Apple and Google and discuss the major similarities and differences between the devices. Read on to learn more about ways in which the Google Pixel compares to Apple's iPhone 7.                       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend                             Topics by Type Android Apple Cloud Database Developer Enterprise Apps Innovation IT Management   Mobile Networking PC Hardware Security Servers Small Business Storage Virtualization Articles by Type News & Analysis Slideshows Blogs Reviews Video   Contact Us About eWeek Sitemap Blogs Security Watch Upfront First Read Storage Station Careers Google Watch Special Features eWeekChat eWeek 30th Anniversary Cloud Backup Project Center Next Generation Firewall Project Center Big Data Analytics Project Center Research Center       Property of QuinStreet Enterprise.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google seems to be playing around with Play Store UI By Ida Torres - October 12, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Google Play Store is one of the products from the tech giant that they seem to want to experiment on with several new features and looks, all executed thorough server side updates. But it’s probably one of those rare times that they’re doing several things at once and basically changing a lot of the user interface items on the app. It’s pretty interesting to see if these changes would work or people will complain about it (probably some of the latter). One of the changes that they’re testing out is renaming the formerly Movies, Music, Books section into just the Entertainment section. When you click on that tab, it will still show different tabs for Movies, Music, Books, and Newsstand. Maybe Google just wanted an umbrella tab so the name will be shorter and people will be curious as to what “Entertainment” is. The carousel for featured items has also been revamped, with the images not stretching from left to right anymore and the “Apps and Games” and “Entertainment” sections have also been relocated. They’re also looking at removing the white space bar where you used to do all your searches. It had the hamburger menu, an icon for voice search, and of course the Google Play branding. Now you would have to tap the search icon on the top right of the screen in order to do your search, including the voice search option, a;lthough people rarely use voice search for the Google Play Store anyways. Lastly, when you open a Google Play link from other apps, you’ll see a green banner with the branding pop up. We’re not assured that any of these test features or UI will make it to the final version. So if you’re one of those receiving these new features/layout, test them out and let us know what you think.

By Alison DeNisco | October 12, 2016, 6:37 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Stephen Shankland/CNET Last week, Google unveiled its new Android phone, Pixel, with built-in Google Assistant, as well as a Daydream View VR headset, and a new Google Wi-Fi mesh router. The Pixel phone was created by Google's new hardware group, with AI at the center of its operations. The blue edition is already hopelessly sold out. However, TechRepublic's CIO Jury has come down against Google hardware in the enterprise. "Enterprises need four things in a mobile device: Security, ecosystem partners, integration capabilities, and support," TechRepublic writer Brandon Vigliarolo wrote. Pixel could be a good choice for businesses in terms of Google Suite integration, 24/7 phone support, and unlimited cloud storage, Vigliarolo reported. But Apple products are still perceived to be more secure, and the company already has enterprise-level partnerships with tech giants such as IBM, Cisco, and SAP. CIOs will ultimately help decide whether or not to transition to Google-based hardware for business purposes. When asked, "Would you trust Google hardware in the enterprise?", seven of our IT executive panelists said no, while five said yes. SEE: Google Pixel phone: The smart person's guide "Google in nature is too open, and the company focus is to share as much as they can with third parties and who knows who," said N'gai Oliveras, director of the information systems division office of the comptroller of Puerto Rico. "This is their main business, selling information. [The hardware would] need to be evaluated and tested." Mike Ferris, global IT director of infrastructure at Lincoln Electric, agreed that he would not trust the hardware—at least for now. "Obviously, that's my initial gut response," Ferris said. "We'd have to learn a lot more about it to make a credible decision." The problem for Simon Johns, IT director for Sheppard Robson Architects LLP, is Google's reputation. "They have a track record of being fickle with their products," Johns said. Whether they said they would trust Google's hardware in their business or not, most respondents answered with a caveat. Cory Wilburn, CIO of the Texas General Land Office, said he would put faith in the company's offerings, "but we would closely review the terms and conditions to look for any language about gathering our data." Google's presence in the tech and business world will likely be difficult to ignore, said Dan Gallivan, director of IT at Payette. That being the case, Gallivan said he would trust it after a careful review of the use agreements. "Like most BYOD policies today, I feel it will probably be harder to keep them out, so why fight it," Gallivan said. "Learn to adjust and work with it." SEE: Google Assistant: The smart person's guide Michael Spears, CIO and chief data officer of the National Council on Compensation Insurance, said it depends on the Google hardware's ability to integrate with other solutions. "I'll trust the Google hardware and, equally important, the OS, only if it can be adequately managed by current Mobile Device Management solutions," Spears said. "I wouldn't relax my MDM standards for any hardware or OS maker." Some said they already use Google products in the enterprise, and would continue doing so. David Wilson, director of IT services at VectorCSP, said his company currently uses Android phones, and has had "wonderful success" with the devices. Bottom line? CXOs remain skeptical of Google's offerings for enterprise use, but most aren't completely counting it out for the future. As Corey Peissig, vice president of technical operations at Optimal Blue, who was not part of the jury, answered, "No—not yet." This month's CIO Jury was: Simon Johns, IT director, Sheppard Robson Architects LLP Dan Gallivan, director of information Technology, Payette David Wilson, director of IT services, VectorCSP Michael R.

(AMZN) Challenges Apple Music With Launch of Amazon Music Unlimited AMZN’s streaming music service is live By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 12, 2016, 10:51 am EST     Popular Posts: Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit GoPro Inc. (GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall Recent Posts: Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit GoPro Inc. (GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) took the wraps off its rumored new streaming music service this morning. Amazon Music Unlimited is now live and ready to take on Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music, Spotify and Alphabet Inc‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play. Source: Amazon Amazon clearly took the time to think this streaming music thing through, putting all the pieces together to hit the ground running with a competitive service right at launch. The press release sent out this morning ticks off all the boxes for competing against established services like Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play. Key features of Amazon Music Unlimited include: $9.99/month fee 30 day free trial App for iOS, Android and desktop offers curated music discovery Ad-free Download for offline listening Support for streaming devices including Sonos Personalized “stations” Family subscription plan (arrives later this year) for $14.99/month In addition, to matching key features and pricing of the competition, Amazon has responded to concerns that its music library would be seriously outclassed. Prime Music had only two million songs, compared to the 30 million claimed by Apple Music and Spotify. AMZN says Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers will have access to a catalog of “tens of millions of songs.” 10 Hottest Gadgets for the 2016 Holiday Shopping Season That choice of words suggests that Amazon’s service might not yet be at the 30 million mark, but it’s probably close enough that most people wouldn’t notice. Amazon Music Unlimited Is a One-Two Punch for AMZN AMZN is actually fighting several battles at once with Amazon Music Unlimited, taking on two high tech rivals. It’s going toe-to-toe with AAPL’s Apple Music and while it will also battle Google Play on the streaming music front, the company is also taking a swipe at the new Google Home, which is in turn trying to knock out its Echo line of connected home speakers. That all sounds a little complicated, but let’s start with pricing. Amazon Prime members get a discounted $7.99 Amazon Music Unlimited membership, or a yearly $79 fee (which works out to $6.58/month). If you’re a Prime member, that significantly undercuts the $9.99/month going rate for everyone else. However, if you own an Amazon Echo, that Amazon Music Unlimited membership fee drops to just $3.99/month. That’s unheard of pricing for streaming music without ads. Better yet, with the Echo, you can use Alexa to control the music by voice, including picking artists, specific tracks and playlists. Alexa will also learn your listening habits and can play random music based on your preferences. AMZN has also created a new Echo-only feature called Side-by-Sides. When a user requests Echo to play a Side-by-Side for a supported album, the tracks will play as the artist provides song commentary. Apple Inc. (AAPL): The Luckiest D*mn Company on Earth The streaming music market experienced a shake-up when AAPL muscled its way in with Apple Music. So far, Spotify has managed to weather that storm, but having Amazon Music Unlimited to contend with as well is not going to help the situation. Even worse is the potential for AMZN’s move to spark a three-way war for subscribers between Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music and Google Play. The three tech giants have deep pockets and could easily weather a price war. They also have machine learning capabilities they can leverage for features like personalizing music payback — as Amazon is doing with the Echo. Spotify, which lost $194 million last year, would be the likely loser if either scenario takes place. Amazon Music Unlimited is available now. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace: Apple Inc.

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us National World US Elections Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos Google brings Accelerated Mobile Pages(AMP) for mobile search results ANI12 October 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share New Delhi [India] , Oct. 12 (ANI): Google on Wednesday announced the roll-out of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for mobile search results in India. In updated version you will see a label that indicates a page is AMP'd. This doesn't change Search results but will show you which sites have pages that are ready to load lightning fast. AMP also helps save data as AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. Today, the median time it takes for an AMP page to load from Google Search is less than one second. Over the last year, since the AMP project started, over 600 million AMP documents, in over 104 languages have been created worldwide. In India, several publishers have embraced AMP. Zomato specifically has seen great early results since AMPing their pages, with page load times decreasing from 3.8 seconds to well under a second. In terms of global impact, the Washington Post has seen a 23 percent increase in mobile search users who return within seven days, and an 88 percent improvement in load time for AMP content versus traditional mobile web. eBay, Pinterest, Wordpress, and Reddit, are among many other publishers worldwide who have adopted AMP and are benefiting from web pages that load much faster. Slow loading sites are arguably one of the most frustrating things about the mobile web. Recent Google research shows that 53 percent of people will leave a site that fails to load in three seconds or less. In addition to the wide adoption of AMP, over the last year Google has also launched several enhancements for AMP including the "Top Stories" section of Google Search, delivering news in a fast and reliable way. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in September 1998.

A report from the Science and Technology Committee – made up of 14 MPs – released on Wednesday warns the UK government that "government leadership in the fields of robotics and AI has been lacking." The report claims citizens have not been equipped to deal with a world that relies more and more on artificial intelligence and calls for the creation of a a new 'Commission on Artificial Intelligence' at the Alan Turing Institute. Based at the British Library in London, the new commission would examine the social, ethical, and legal implications of developments in the field of AI. Related: What is Google DeepMind? Acting chair of the Science and Technology Committee, Dr Tania Mathias MP, said in a statement: "Science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our lives over the coming decades. "It is too soon to set down sector-wide regulations for this nascent field but it is vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now." Self-driving cars and computer-aided diagnoses for patients were highlighted by the committee as ways in which artificial intelligence has, and is set to, change the way we live. Google's AI-focused DeepMind division is based in the UK The new report follows the creation of a 'Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society', established by some of tech's major players including Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. The partnership will consider numerous issues including privacy, safety, and the interaction between AI and people, in order to help ensure artificial intelligence is implemented safely and ethically in the future. But Dr Mathias says the government should be doing more, adding: "Some major technology companies — including Google and Amazon — have recently come together to form the 'Partnership on AI'. "While it is encouraging that the sector is thinking about the risks and benefits of AI, this does not absolve the government of its responsibilities. "It should establish a 'Commission on Artificial Intelligence' to identify principles for governing the development and application of AI, and to foster public debate." The report also calls on the government to provide education to ensure citizens have the skills needed to function in a society where AI plays a greater role.

If you Google ‘Why Do Idahoans’, This Is What Comes Up First By Doc Holliday October 12, 2016 8:00 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Google Funny things can happen when you Google things. I’ll give you an example. I was about to Google something when Google tried to complete my phrase before I typed it. I was asking “Why do Idahoans…” when Google took over and this is what auto-complete put in. Yes, you read that right. The most common phrase (apparently) when the words “Why do Idahoans” is entered ends with “hate Californians”. The results are both troubling and hysterical. You get a 2009 Topix article “Do some Idahoans really hate Californians and outsiders?” One of the commenters said they don’t dislike outsiders, but do hate Californians because “they lack common sense”. Another one that comes up in that search is a blog called “Ten Things That Idahoans Want Outsiders To Understand”. #9 on that list claims that Idahoans don’t hate Californians, but then goes on to say that they hate when Californians try to make Idaho into California.  Hmm. The most damning of all of them is a Washington Post story that dates back to 1979 (aka “The Stone Age”) which claims “To Most Idahoans, A Plague Of Locusts Is Californians”. Ouchie. I’ve been called a lot of things in my life, but haven’t been compared to a Biblical plague – YET. Here’s the deal, though. I DON’T hate Californians. But, then again, I lived in Monterey back in 1992/93. That means I AM ONE OF THEM. (*shudder*) The hunter is the hunted.

(Google) As is evident from the company’s product unveiling last week, Google is getting into hardware in a big way. At a press event in San Francisco that was simulcast in Toronto, the company launched an array of new products including two new Pixel phones, the Daydream View virtual reality headset, the Google Wi-Fi router, the Home voice-assistant speaker and a new 4K Chromecast dongle. It was the largest assortment of devices ever launched at once by the company and a coming-out party of sorts for its recently formed hardware division, which is headed up by former Motorola head Rick Osterloh. How virtual reality could soon help coworkers stay in touch Osterloh, recruited earlier this year, confirmed this is no mere hobby for the company. “This is a natural step and we’re in it for the long run,” he said. So why is Google suddenly so interested in hardware? There are a few reasons. Osterloh, for one, affirmed what companies such as Apple have long known – that designing both hardware and software together generally results in superior products. Google is evidently no longer happy to supply just the software. Also, as I wrote for The National last week, there is the likelihood that some of the new products – the Pixel phones and the Home speaker in particular – will help Google maintain its sizeable lead over competitors in artificial intelligence. The devices will help the company gather more voice, photo and text data—the stuff on which AI is built. But one other likely motivation for the hardware charge is virtual reality, a field that Google clearly wants to lead. We’re not talking about the sort of high-end VR that Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR are pushing. Google looks to be more interested in the lower-end, or the more near-term and achievable segment of 360 photos and videos. Google of course pioneered 360 photos years ago with Street View, the ground-eye-view function of its Maps app that has since become indispensable for people trying to find their way around. The company opened Street View to public contributions a few years ago and has been certifying professional photographers since. In the meantime, 360 cameras have become better and cheaper. Selling for between $300 to $500, the Ricoh Theta S, Samsung Gear 360 and LG 360 are all within reach of mainstream buyers and supply decent quality images. Google’s Street View apps and YouTube platform, meanwhile, are among the only major online outlets that currently make publishing and sharing 360 images and video easy (Facebook, which owns Oculus, is the other). Viewing 360 images and video on a desktop, phone or tablet is neat and easy – you either click and drag, or swipe. I’ve been fiddling with a number of 360 cameras for a few months now and the reaction the photos and videos inspire are inevitably the same: amazement. Here’s video I shot with the Ricoh Theta S on the Maid of the Mist tour in Niagara Falls:   Such 360 content is cool on a two-dimensional surface, but it becomes jaw-dropping when viewed with a VR headset. That’s not just hyperbole – images and videos literally wrap around the viewer, which makes the experience far more visceral than anything found in 2D. Cheap headsets for viewing this content are proliferating, but so far the best available has been Samsung’s Gear 360. Virtual Reality will make more headlines than sales in 2016 Powered by Oculus technology, the $139 device turns smartphones into miniature VR machines, good for playing short games and looking at 360 photos and videos. Of course, the device only works with a select few Samsung phones. Google’s Daydream View, pictured at top, is a big development in VR and 360 imagery. The device, which I tried out at the company’s event last week, is handily the best phone-based VR headset yet. It’s wrapped in soft fabric, so it’s not as clunky as the Gear VR and its lenses don’t fog up. It’s also lightweight and comfortable and the lenses are crystal clear. There’s also a small touch control for navigating around the various associated apps and menus: (Google) The Daydream View is also priced attractively at $99 and will work with Daydream-certified devices, starting with the Pixel phones. All told, Samsung’s Gear VR is facing a formidable competitor. How Felix & Paul Studios make films for the coming VR boom High-end virtual reality is going to face a number of obstacles in gaining acceptance – cost, movement problems and bandwidth issues, which I’ll address in a separate post, are among them. The low-end, however, is where the real action is going to be. Three-sixty imagery is high in “wow” factor – I’ve joked with friends that I just can’t take boring 2D photos anymore – and it’s perfectly affordable. Put those two together and the field is primed for an explosion of user-generated content. Google knows this and is getting in at the ground floor with the correct hardware. The only thing the company is missing is a good 360 camera. It’s a good bet that’s next. It’s also a good bet that the future is three-dimensional, which is why every household is going to want a good, inexpensive VR headset with which to view all those user-created photos and videos. Google has smartly positioned itself to lead the charge in nearly every aspect of this 360 future.

By Jack Wallen | October 12, 2016, 6:07 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Last week, Google unveiled the new Pixel phone, with Google Assistant built in. It's Google's latest attempt at a virtual assistant aimed to take down the likes of Siri and power their upcoming Google Home. If you are of the impatient sort, and you want to see Assistant in action, you don't have to wait. How? Install Allo. Although Allo is listed as a "smart messaging app", it is much, much more. SEE: Google Pixel phone: The smart person's guide More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter Allo offers three components which, when combined, make for a really impressive system. However it's the Assistant piece that really shines. What is Assistant? As I said, it's a virtual assistant wrapped inside a messaging app that actually functions outside of messaging, and does a remarkable job. For instance, you can ask Assistant to tell you about the news, at which point Assistant will ask you to specify what kind of news. Once you've specified, it'll then display a card that you can tap on to open web page containing the news in question. Or you can schedule an appointment. Or... Wait a second, isn't this sounding a bit like Google Now? Yes, it is. But remember, the developers shifted Google Now to Google Now On Tap (which has been renamed to Screen Search). So why the seeming redundancy? Of Assistant, Google Says: "The assistant is conversational - an ongoing two-way dialogue between you and Google that understands your world and helps you get things done. It makes it easy to buy movie tickets while on the go, to find that perfect restaurant for your family to grab a quick bite before the movie starts, and then help you navigate to the theater." Have a conversation That conversational element is key to what makes Assistant different. Instead of instructing Assistant on what you want, you have a natural conversation with it (it picks up on subtle differences in the use of language). As hokey as that might sound, it's actually a vast improvement over what the competition has to offer. Instead of saying "Okay Google, set appointment", you say, "Set an appointment" (or "schedule and appointment" or "book an appointment", etc.). Upon recording your command, Assistant will then ask, "When is the event?". Answer the question and Assistant will continue asking question to specify the event (Figure A). Figure A Image: Jack Wallen Assistant, via Allo, running on the OnePlus 3. The conversational aspect of Assistant makes using the tool remarkably easy to get news, schedule appointments, find reviews of movies, purchase tickets, and more. What you can do with Amazon's Echo, you'll probably be able to do with Assistant. And considering this will be driving Google Home (their take on Amazon Echo), Assistant's ability to determine the context of a conversation is even more remarkable. The big caveat You might have heard that Edward Snowden has warned users to not install or use Allo. Why? The concern is simple— that conversations will be retained on servers. There is another, more disconcerting issue. Allo was supposed to employ end-to-end encryption for messages. That is, unfortunately, not happening. At least not out of the box. You can, however, start a chat in Incognito mode to encrypt your chats (this should be the default). But what about Assistant? Will these conversations between user and AI be encrypted, or vanish from the Google servers once they've served their purpose? It seems the answer to these questions are "no" and "until the user deletes them." Good news: the deletion of Assistant chats is a really simple task. While you're using Assistant, tap on the menu button in the top right corner, tap Clear history (Figure B), and then tap Delete. Figure B Image: Jack Wallen Viola!, your chat history is cleared. Even so... Those who consider security a top priority will probably avoid Allo and Assistant. But if you're using Assistant for innocuous questions and adding simple events to your calendar, there's really no harm. And experiencing what Google has done with AI, is really impressive. If you want to see the technology that will drive Google Home (and add something that could possibly make your interaction with Android more productive), I highly recommending at least giving the Assistant portion of Allo a try.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Social Google rolls out Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for mobile search results in India Google rolls out Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for mobile search results in India Google has started rolling out its faster Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for mobile search results in India. By: Tech Desk | Published:October 12, 2016 7:35 pm Google AMP pages for mobile search results are now rolling out in India. Google has started rolling out its faster Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for mobile search results in India. Earlier only news related pages would show in the AMP format with a carousel appearing on top of the mobile search results. Now Google is extending to this to all web pages and websites in India, and it will start rolling out these pages soon. Google says AMP pages won’t affect search rankings for pages and websites,instead will show pages which are ready to load quickly. Each AMP page will have a a label that indicates a page is AMP’d, says Google. AMP pages will have a little lightning symbol next to them with AMP written as well. This will indicate that the page loads faster than others. Google’s AMP Project is an open source initiative that addresses the issue of slow site loading on the internet and just like Facebook’s Instant Articles, these are designed to load instantaneously. Google claims AMP pages also helps save data and they use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. According to Google, the median time it takes for an AMP page to load from Google Search is less than one second. Google’s AMP project was announced last year, and there are over 600 million AMP documents that have been created in over 104 languages across the world. In India, publishers like Zomato, NDTV, as well Indian Express Group are all using AMP. Also read: YouTube Go app from Google: Here’s how to get it, and how it works According to Google, Zomato has seen page load times decreasing from 3.8 seconds to well under a second since they used AMP. Globally, publishers like Washington Post have seen a 23 per cent increase in mobile search users who return within 7 days, and an 88 per cent improvement in load time for AMP content versus traditional mobile web. Other big players adopting AMP pages are eBay, Pinterest, WordPress, and Reddit. With Google focusing on India, and trying to create products tailored for the country’s slow networks, it is no surprise that AMP pages are coming here as well. Google recently announced YouTube GO an app just for India, which will work on slower data connections and also allow users to share videos with their friends. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPM Modi holds meeting with senior ministers on demonetisation process BusinessWhat jammed the ATM: Secrecy and no Plan B IndiaBear pain for 50 days, then punish me: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaCollegium lists 7 High Court chief justices for elevation to Supreme Court Board exams today, hope, fear in Valley: ‘Can’t lose year’ EntertainmentPadmavati will be extremely difficult, says Deepika Padukone EntertainmentSalman Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan praise PM Modi on demonetisation EntertainmentAs a father, I always support my kids, says Aamir Khan EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show Must Read SportsDraw for India, a moral victory for England SportsDid India miss a trick by rolling out a true track?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Assistant can be ported to older Nexus, here’s how to enable it By R Padla - October 12, 2016 2 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google Now will soon be dead but it’s being replaced by the Google Assistant. As early as 2012, we already knew about this idea which then became Google Now. A few months ago, the term has once again popped during the early days of the Swordfish Android Wear smartwatches. It’s official already and we even know it will have Hindu language support. We’ve been saying that it can be your personal Google as it is makes use of more natural language AI. This new service will be available on Android 7.0 Nougat initially but as you know, anything Android can be modified. An XDA member shared that Google Assistant can be ported to the Nexus 6P. It’s an unofficial procedure but something developers expected after the system images of the Pixel were released. If you know how to, you can just access build.prop and install the latest Google App (Velvet). That’s just one way but you can also enable Google Assistant on your smartphone that runs Android 7.0. You can enable the feature on the following devices: Google Nexus 6P (stock), Nexus 6P, Google Nexus 6 (OctoOS), Nexus 5 | AOSP 7.0 by Santhosh M | BOKROM, Nexus 4, Pixel C, Moto G (2013,) Moto G (2015), and OnePlus (CM14). Here are ways on how to enable Google Assistant: 1. Manual editing. On the build.prop, add these lines on the code: ro.product.model=Pixel XL ro.opa.eligible_device=true 2: Flash the following files Flashable ZIPs by @FaserF available HERE On Android Marshmallow, Google Assistant can be enabled with the updated N-ify Xposed Module. This mod brings Nougat to older Android version which can also mean Google can access Google Assistant even on Android 6.0.

The latest Google service to get some love is the Play Store. An update is rolling out now that includes the new round icon and app shortcuts for the Pixel Launcher. The update also adds 4K movies and TV shows and a new icon for promos and gifts. Round icons were rumored before the official announcement of the Pixel phones. A lot of people were against this design, but it’s here to stay (for now). The default launcher on the Pixel phones adds round icons to every app. The Play Store has ditched the shopping bag for a simple white circle. We’re not huge fans of the round icons, but it is what it is. The second change to the Play Store icon is the addition of an app shortcut. When you access the shortcut you’ll see an option to jump straight to “My apps.” If you like to check for updates frequently, this shortcut will save some time. Lastly, 4K movies and TV shows will soon be available for renting and purchasing. A new icon for promotions and gifts is larger and more colorful. Download the new version of the Play Store here.

Whether its Google’s expansion in India, Facebook’s declaration of war against Amazon or Uber’s mission to relegate the Black Cab to the London Transport Museum, the ‘new’ generation of technology companies are making their presence felt throughout the world. While it may feel unusual to call Google new, let’s not forget its only 18. If it was a proper lad it would probably be sat in the corner of a Weatherspoon’s, chugging down a pitcher of Blue Lagoon, while lighting a Sambuca chaser, adjusting its Snapback and throwing a couple of pound-coins in the closest fruity, but instead its launching a group plan for its MVNO. Google Fi, the company’s MVNO, has the potential to shake up the market. The team has written a clever algorithm which automatically connects the user to the best available signal, whether that’s Wifi or one of three 4G LTE partner networks. The user only pays for the data used and get credited for the remainder at the end of the month. The cost also remains the same irrelevant as to where you are in the world. The team has now gone another step towards disruption introducing a group plan. Users can now have up to six people on one plan, for $15 per month each. It’s only a $5 discount from the base account, however like the rest of Google Fi, it’s simple (see how the bill is broken down below). Google Fi also seems to be chasing a new market as well. While most other providers in the group-plan segment are focused on families, Google Fi clearly notes that you can add “friends from college or your family”. Although families are the most straight-forward market segment to chase, there is huge number of broke-college students, who are connectivity crazed, data starved and internet driven, who would most likely appreciate simplicity and the opportunity for a refund occasionally. It’ll be a tough market to crack, but potentially a lucrative one. Alongside the launch of the deal, Google is also offering $100 off the Nexus 6P, and $150 off the Nexus 5X, when bought and activated through Project Fi. This is another feature which would appeal to both families and cash-strapped millennials driven by the desire to have the latest technology. Google is one of those companies which will never be happy sat still. Most organizations would say this, but very few can match the aggressive ambition of the internet giant. Despite still being only a teenager, Google has demonstrated the desire to dominate markets. When it wants to be number one in a market, the team certainly throw engineers, time and money at the ambition.

On Wednesday, Google announced the start of rollout of AMP for mobile search results in India. The mobile search results with compatible pages will now show with a 'lightning' symbol next to them, leading you to webpages that take relatively less time to load. As before, Google insists that search results themselves will not change and that AMP pages will not be prioritised. Back in February this year, Google began rolling out AMP to the Top Stories carousel in mobile search results, but was limited to news. It is worth noting that Google did not extend AMP to all supported pages (not just news content) in mobile search results until September. This support for non-news AMP results is now rolling out to India.The AMP Project is an open source initiative by Google that addresses the issue of slow site loading on the Internet enhancing it to render instantly. It has been a year since testing of AMP pages began, and Google is now celebrating AMP's first anniversary. Google AMP in mobile search results in India comprises many news as well as non-news websites like Aaj Tak, NDTV, The Indian Express, and Zomato. AMP essentially shows a bare-bones version of a website so that it can load faster, and is also claimed to save about 10 times the mobile data an equivalent non-AMP webpage would consume. Meanwhile, apart from giving some useful statistics to how different websites are employing Google AMP on Google Search, Google has also emphasised on the different categories and sections like retail, travel, recipe, general knowledge. and entertainment that the websites are demarcated in. As per Google's data, slow loading sites are arguably one of the most annoying things about the mobile Web. Detailing some statistics, Google says that 53 percent of people will leave a website that fails to load in three seconds or less. Google India has also laid down its roadmap for the inclusions and improvements that will arrive on AMP in future. These include an initial support for data entry use cases (such as forms and search boxes), support to include a variety of content formats (like news articles, recipes, local listings, product listings), and further alignment with Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Impressively, AMP will soon start supporting more engaging and interactive video experiences.

Politics | Arts & Entertainment | Style & Design | Business & Technology | Search for: Submit Observer Politics National New York New Jersey International Editorials Arts & Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style & Design Fashion Food & Drink Health & Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business & Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups Ten Digital Skills You Need to Master to Become an Entrepreneur By Tomas Laurinavicius • 10/12/16 9:31am Coming up with an idea for a business it’s not the hardest part, execution is. tomaslau.com Not everyone is destined to become the next Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, but applying an entrepreneurial mindset to your work can work wonders even if you work in a large company or are a freelancer with a steady client base. You might already have a set of strong digital skills but polishing them and adding a few more can take you to the next level. I always wanted to become an entrepreneur. Not just because of the opportunity to become financially independent, but also because of the lifestyle and the possibility to have a positive impact on the world. Entrepreneurs have ideas and go after them while changing the world. Coming up with an idea for a business it’s not the hardest part, execution is. Today I want to share 10 digital skills you need to master to become an unstoppable entrepreneur. 1. Communication Communication is the number one skill you must master if you want to become an entrepreneur. You’ll have to explain your idea over and over again. Whether it’s to pitch to an investor, a potential co-founder or your customer, being able to communicate on a personal and professional level undoubtedly will save you a lot of time and stress. Develop the ability to inspire and motivate others. Work on your vision and make it so clear and inspiring that you don’t have to repeat it over and over again. There will be times when you or your team doesn’t feel like moving forward, so make sure you are ready for the crisis. Practice public speaking and study communication to understand how you can transfer information more efficiently. The most inspiring organizations have visions bigger than any individual and possess the desire to improve your world. Learn and understand cultural differences. After high school, I moved to study in Denmark. My classmates were from 6 different countries. I had to adapt and learn to collaborate with people from different cultures. Studying cultures and international communication taught me patience, respect, and active listening skills. Knowing where your team comes from makes team building and training easier and more efficient. Show leadership and confidence. The more you grow as an entrepreneur, the more trust and leadership skills you will need to keep up. You’ll have to learn to say no, negotiate, hire and fire people. It’s not fun. As a leader, you have to make tough decisions every day. You may need to cut costs. You may need to fire someone toxic from the team, or someone who’s underperforming. You’ll be blamed for failure. It’s your job to toughen up and lead by example. Here are a few tools to help you communicate information more efficiently and improve productivity at work. Asana – Project management and communication within your company or department. Intercom – Automate and optimize prospect interaction and customer support. Trello – Personal project management or smaller team-based project management. Evernote – Personal project management and notes. Slack – A messaging app for teams. Get focused on work and reduce email communication. G Suite – Formerly Google Apps for Work is a great all-in-one solution for business. Get 20% off your first year of G Suite with the following codes: 47NDKRMW4KEEXFY L96K9LHALQTL943 Dropbox – Trustworthy cloud storage for personal and business files. Meldium – Team password sharing and management solution. Docracy – Open source legal documents. Prezi – A powerful cloud-based storytelling tool for creating engaging presentations. Skype – Free software for instant messaging and video/audio calls. 2. Finances Mastering money and improving financial intelligence is essential to a healthy entrepreneurial life. Most businesses fall off the rails because they run out of money. Whether you’re a solopreneur, freelancer or run a large enterprise, one of the critical metrics you must focus on is cash flow. Learn to manage money. Successful entrepreneurs know the importance of managing money. You must find out how to raise funds by selling your services, product or early prototype. You can head out and find investors or venture capitalists, but you will have to learn to ask for money comfortably. You’ll have to become critical, analytical, and be prepared to cut costs. It’s not going to be easy, but it’s worth it. Investing basics. Read about investing. One of the best personal finance books out there, Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki, will teach you how to acquire assets, avoid liabilities and start building your net worth. Always invest in yourself, buy books, courses, and attend conferences, seminars, and workshops. Whether it’s your business or personal money, invest only in the field that you know the best. Always minimize unnecessary risk. If you invest in something, make sure you can influence the outcome so you can take action when things go wrong. Accounting. Learning basic accounting and bookkeeping is not so hard, but it will help you develop financial thinking and help you understand the pulse of your business. Learning to read, analyze and manipulate spreadsheets can give you a lot of valuable data to make hard decisions easier. Forecasting and predicting will become more comfortable as you will have data to rely on. Square – Accept payments from anywhere. Xero – Professional accounting software with friendly interface. Stripe – One of the best online payment processing solution. Gumroad – Sell digital files like PDFs, graphic, videos and more. Wave Apps – Free small business software including accounting, invoicing, payments, payroll, and receipts. You Need A Budget – Simple yet powerful personal budget and finance software. PayPal – Popular online payment solution for sending and receiving money as well as selling online. Revolut – Online bank that doesn’t charge you anything. Get a free prepaid debit card for everyday use. 3. Branding Every business has a face. Think of Apple, Facebook, Tesla and Virgin, and Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Richard Branson spring to mind. These companies are not only world-famous and influential, but they also had a strong brand influenced by the founders. Everyone has a brand, and everyone is a brand. The way you talk, the way you respond to emails, the way you introduce yourself, the way you write is your brand. How to build a personal brand. Invest into learning how to create a strong personal brand. You’ll have to practice awareness to dig deep into your subconscious to understand who you are, who you want to be and who you pretend to be because of peer pressure, insecurities and aspirations. It all starts with the vision, the grand plan for life. Then it comes to what you can die for, your way of getting to that vision, your values. Is it stepping over everyone to get to your goal or is it by lifting others to their goals and then getting to yours? Finally, you’ll need an action plan and mantras for your daily life, for the next year and ten years. Create a blog. Writing is one of the oldest forms of communication and influence. Learn to write well. Clear writing touches people. Always provide value, serve your tribe and be yourself. It will take the time to find your voice, but once you find it, it will be worth it. Curate great content. Your time as an entrepreneur is very limited. Creating content might take too long so you can start curating it. Create a newsletter, become an active curator on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook or any other network. Once you’ve established your brand, you will know the right platform to focus on.

You can build the best product in the world, but if nobody knows about it, it’s worthless. Gain an in-depth understanding of the various digital marketing disciplines such as search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, pay-per-click (PPC), conversion optimization, content marketing and email marketing. Learn how to identify your target audience. If you try to appeal to everyone, you serve no one. Learn to ask smart questions and perform initial audience surveys. Learn storytelling. Storytelling is a powerful tool you can use to engage your audience and get press. Learn to drive traffic. Study the basics of content marketing, social media and SEO.

From the beginning of humankind, evolution has favored people capable of forming strong social ties. Build your tribe. Form a group of well-chosen entrepreneur friends. You’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Make sure you surround yourself with visionaries, executors and champions. It may look scary to cut off toxic people, but you’re either growing and moving forward, or you’re shrinking and going down. Connect with people on social networks. Practice proactivity. Become an active listener and ask questions. Read an article? Send an email with your opinion, say thanks and start a conversation. Not all interactions will be fruitful but over time you will be making connections that matter. Develop a habit of reaching out. If you don’t ask the answer is always no.

Automation Doing the same thing over and over again doesn’t make you productive. Doing the thing that can be done by software is a waste of time that will cause huge regret. If you can’t execute something using software, learn to delegate it. Maximize your workflow efficiency. Review your digital habits. I can bet there are ways you can use your time online more efficiently. Research alternatives for the tools you’re using at the moment. Learn new software and workflow if necessary. Learn to delegate. Being an entrepreneur means balancing multiple priorities. Investing time in providing clear guidelines and training may look daunting at the beginning.

Take a course on big data, learn about economics, behavioral psychology, and statistics. Identify trends and predict the future. Always follow your industry news and science behind it so you can bet and win by predicting the next big thing. Learn the 80/20 rule.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Google adds group plans to its Project Fi cellular service by Eric Born  8:00 AM on October 12, 2016 Google turned a few heads recently with its new Pixel and Pixel XL phones, the successors to its Nexus line of in-house devices. The phones' availability is currently limited, so people have been paying a little more attention to Google's Project Fi cellular service, which is one of the few places where one can pre-order a Pixel. To turn that interest into a sale or two, Google added group plans to Project Fi recently. It's also deeply discounted Nexus phones bought with the service. The basics of Project Fi remain the same. With Project Fi's contract-free service, phones attempt to use Wi-Fi for as much communication as possible, using free, Google-vetted Wi-Fi hotspots when they're available. Sprint or T-Mobile cellular towers provide service wherever Wi-Fi isn't an option. Basic plans start at $20 a month, and include unlimited voice calls, texting, and Wi-Fi tethering. On top of the base charge, users pay $10/GB for cellular data. Now, Project Fi users can invite up to six other people to join them in a group plan. The "manager," or owner of the primary account, still pays $20 a month for basic service, but each additional line is discounted to $15 a month. Cellular data still costs $10/GB. Through Google's Project Fi app, each member of the group can track everyone else's data usage. The manager can go a step further and set limits on the amount of data other members consume. A phone service isn't much without a phone, though. Project Fi still has a limited range of options, but Google is offering last year's Nexus phones at a discount to those who find its new Pixel phones a little too pricey. The 32GB Nexus 6P has been discounted $100 to $399, and the 16GB Nexus 5X has been discounted $150 to $199. Both discounts only apply to these phones when they're purchased and activated through Project Fi.

(Image: Reuters) Technology giant Google on Wednesday announced the roll-out of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for mobile search results in India that will load web pages at a lightning fast speed. With this new update, when you search on your mobile device, you will see a label that indicates a page is AMP. This does not change search results but will show you which sites have pages that are ready to load lightning fast, the company said in a statement. The AMP Project helps save data as AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. Over the last year, since the AMP project started, over 600 million AMP documents, in over 104 languages have been created worldwide. In India, several publishers have embraced AMP. Globally, the Washington Post has seen a 23 per cent increase in mobile search users who return within seven days and an 88 per cent improvement in load time for AMP content versus traditional mobile web. In addition to the wide adoption of AMP, people have also embraced Google's several enhancements for AMP over the last year. accelerated mobile pages Google Google AMP Trending Articles Hillary Clinton Blames FBI Director Comey For Loss: Reports At Least Three Indian-Americans Win State Assembly Elections Kent State University Course Examines Hillary Clinton's Life These Have Been Very Tough Days: Hillary Clinton on Poll Loss Trending Articles Hillary Clinton Blames FBI Director Comey For Loss: Reports At Least Three Indian-Americans Win State Assembly Elections Kent State University Course Examines Hillary Clinton's Life These Have Been Very Tough Days: Hillary Clinton on Poll Loss Live: PM Modi Holds Late-Night Meeting on Currency Ban, Reviews Situation Watch: India Signs Civil Nuclear Deal with Japan Farmers Will Not Be Taxed, Says PM Modi Demonetisation has Taken Gleam From Mayawati, Akhilesh's Face: Amit Shah From Our Network Demonetisation: Narendra Modi has taken a political gamble by annoying his core voter base- FirstPost Demonetisation to hit Maoist activities in Chhattisgarh: Police - Pradesh18 Girl refuses to marry 'drunk' groom, walks out from wedding ceremony - Pradesh18 About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Israel President Reuven Rivlin Leaves for Six-day Visit to India India Vs England: Kohli Unhappy With Amount of Grass on Rajkot Wicket Toyota to Pay up to USD 3.4 Billion to Settle US truck Lawsuit New Zealand Earthquake Kills Two; PM John Key Cancels Argentina Trip PM Modi Holds Urgent Meet to End Demonetisation Crisis Within 50 Days Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Google Introduces Top Stories In Desktop Search Result Pages Posted: Oct 12 2016, 4:49am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Gallery 3 images   Google is bringing Top Stories known from mobile to the SERPs on desktop. Google has made some major changes to search recently. The company announced end of September that Penguin (Penguin 4.0 if you still count versions) is now part of the core algorithm and is real-time. While for most users of Google this algorithm change is not of interest, there is a new user interface on desktop search result pages that are quite different. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Google is now featuring stories in "Top stories" instead of "In the news" in SERPs. The layout looks similar like the Top stories carousel for AMP pages on the mobile interface of Google. The content shown in top stories is a mix of Google News articles and other relevant sources. Google has started to mix content into the news block a while ago. When you searched for a new movie trailer the youtube link would appear. If you searched for a celebrity, his latest tweet would show up in the news section.  This mix of sources is like one reason why Google is switching to calling these featured results "top stories." The Top stories layout makes the featured content stand out from the organic search results in a big way. Each story has a rather big thumb nail and the individual tiles are over 110 pixel tall and are either placed on top or after a few organic results.  The Top stories layout is not rolled out to all users of Google.com yet. I only encountered it on one browser, where I am not logged into my Google account. It is not clear yet when and if Top stories will roll out on the Google desktop SERPS.   Gallery 3 images You May Like The Author Luigi Lugmayr Luigi Lugmayr (Google+) is the founding chief Editor of I4U News and brings over 15 years experience in the technology field to the ever evolving and exciting world of gadgets.

Google's Panoramio photo-sharing service bids farewell 0 Share: Photography by Stephen Shankland October 7, 2016 2:29 PM PDT @stshank Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Enlarge Image The Panoramio website, closing November 4, 2016, caught on among those who liked seeing photos linked to real-world locations.Photo by Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET Google will put photo-sharing site Panoramio out of its misery in a month, a decision that triggered fresh anguish and anger among people who have stuck with it through thick and thin. This week, Panoramio fans saw the words "Panoramio is closing," with a November 4 deadline. As word spread from a post by a Panoramio forum moderator, outrage and sadness ensued. You might have never heard of Panoramio, but you've probably benefited from the site. Its photos have been a prime source of imagery on Google Maps. It worked because Panoramio was early to embrace location tagging that lets you see photos of a specific spot. Panoramio, acquired in 2007, and Picasa, acquired in 2004, were early Google forays into online photo sharing, but Google is phasing both out in favor of Google Photos. Communities dramatically improve online services by adding valuable content at no cost to the company, recruiting new members and building social ties that give a service staying power. But those advantages become problems when it's time to shut a community down, even one that only a tiny fraction of a company's users embrace. The death of Panoramio is no surprise. In 2014, Google tried to scrap Panoramio. Facing more the wrath of more than 10,000 displeased petitioners, the company commuted Panoramio's death sentence in 2015, but it was clear the site wasn't a priority. Despite the downward trajectory, some users remained loyal though. Feeling betrayed, some of them now seem eager to spite Google. Digital-age photography How Google hopes its Pixel camera will win over iPhone fans Yahoo's Flickr app now supports Apple's 3D Touch ​iPhone owners can recoup their costs with 500px camera app "I have millions of views, some photos with more than 100,000 views, achieved Level 5 local guide badge, I've reported tons of errors in maps and now? They're saying me goodbye. We don't need you anymore, because we are accepting only photos of restaurants now," said user PavolG on the forum. "I'm glad I deleted most of my photos two years ago so that I had only 20 photos left to delete today. My former Picasa albums will follow," wrote user c0l0gne1. Google didn't respond to a request for comment. There are abundant photo-sharing communities today for those who don't like Google Photos, including Yahoo's Flickr, Facebook's Instagram, and 500px. One that seems to have caught on among Panoramio refugees is French photo-sharing site Ipernity. It seems to have some of the community-friendly features Panoramio users liked.

Does Google's new Pixel phone make it time to try Project Fi too? In this edition of Ask Maggie, CNET's Marguerite Reardon offers a refresher on Google's first wireless service, Project Fi. Does Google's new Pixel phone make it time to try Project Fi too? 0 Share: Mobile by Marguerite Reardon October 8, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @maggie_reardon Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Google has added its new flagship phone, the Pixel, to the device lineup for its Project Fi wireless service. But is Project Fi right for you? Google on Tuesday announced the Pixel and Pixel XL, two high-end smartphones meant to go up against Samsung's Galaxy devices and Apple's iPhones. It's Google's first attempt to market a smartphone to the masses. Along with getting your hands on the device through Verizon, you can also use the Pixel on Project Fi, the experimental wireless network Google launched in 2015. Up to now, the service worked only with three of Google's Nexus branded smartphones: the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6. In this edition of Ask Maggie, I'll offer some more details on Project Fi and help one reader, curious about Google's new Pixel, decide whether to give Project Fi a chance too. Dear Maggie, I'm intrigued by Google's new Pixel phone. I read it will be available on Google's wireless network, Project Fi. I'm not really sure what Project Fi is all about. Is it a service I should consider? Or should I stick with Verizon or some other major carrier? Thanks, Curious About Google Dear Curious, The beauty of the Pixel is that it gives you lots of options. Even though the Pixel is being marketed as an exclusive to Verizon, the truth is that it's also sold through Google as an unlocked phone and can be used on any wireless network in the US, including Google's own Project Fi. Pixel Phone by GooglePhoto by James Martin/CNET The first question you need to ask yourself is whether you can even access Project Fi. Once you've figured that out, you can start comparing it to services from other carriers. Refresher on Project Fi Let's start with the basics. Google's Project Fi is a service that uses a combination of cellular coverage from Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular as well as local Wi-Fi networks. This means you need to make sure you live and work in an area where at least one of these carriers offers strong coverage. A key aspect of Project Fi's service is technology that determines which network offers the best connection, allowing it to seamlessly switch among these networks if one connection weakens, so having access to two or to all three of these networks is even better. The biggest benefit of Project Fi's Wi-Fi-first approach is that it can access more than a million Wi-Fi hotspots to provide inexpensive wireless internet connectivity. The idea is that if you can use less-expensive Wi-Fi infrastructure more often than a cellular network, you can keep service costs low. Plans start at $20 for unlimited talk, text messaging and access to Wi-Fi based data. The price increases by $10 for each gigabyte of data service you use on one of the three cellular networks Project Fi accesses when Wi-Fi isn't available. So if you want 1GB of data per month to use while roaming on a cellular data network, that will cost you $30 a month. With 2GB of data, you'll spend $40 a month, and so on. 7 Up close with Google's power-packed Pixel XL The pricing is pretty straightforward, but if you're using a lot of cellular data, those charges can add up quickly. For about the same price as that 4GB or 5GB of data on Project Fi, you can get unlimited talk, text and data on Sprint and T-Mobile. Some prepaid offers are also comparable in price. Wi-Fi-first competitor Republic Wireless, which will also support the Pixel, is one such option that's cheaper than Project Fi. Its basic service with unlimited talk, text and Wi-Fi data starts at $15 a month. It also offers a better deal for customers who need more data for cellular roaming. Its service, which works with either Sprint or T-Mobile, costs $45 a month for 4GB of cellular data, while Project Fi charges $60 for 4GB of cellular roaming. Still, Project Fi has its benefits. Because Project Fi doesn't charge hefty roaming fees for data service when you're abroad, it's a particularly attractive plan for international travelers. The service is available in more than 135 different countries. Phone calls while abroad if you're not using a Wi-Fi hotspot are 20 cents per minute and text messaging is free regardless of whether you're on Wi-Fi or roaming onto a local cellular carrier. The bottom line Project Fi is great for people who don't use much cellular data, because they're either light data users or they have access to Wi-Fi most of the time. It's also a great service for folks who travel abroad frequently. If this isn't you, you may want to consider prepaid or unlimited plans from carriers like T-Mobile and Sprint or other Wi-Fi-first operators, like Republic Wireless, which can offer you a better deal. The good news is that the Pixel can be used on just about any US carrier, so you can give Project Fi a chance and if you don't like it, you can switch to another carrier.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google reportedly got writers from Pixar, The Onion to boost Assistant By Ida Torres - October 12, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When you use a virtual assistant to get anything done on your mobile device, you probably would want to have it sound as human as possible, without losing the “robot” or Android feel of it (you know, because of that uncanny valley thing). When Google unveiled its Google Home smart speaker, it also wasn’t smart enough yet to respond to whatever you’re saying. What it basically knows right now has been written by humans, and apparently Google chose to hire writers from Pixar and The Onion to write out some of the expected or unexpected responses. Writers from two seemingly diverse companies are apparently responsible to what the Google Assistant responds to you, at least initially. This was a move to make it as “relatable and human-friendly” as possible as opposed to just a disembodied voice answering your questions. As with a lot of machine learning products, the more you will use Google Home and consequently Google Assistant, the more they will learn about your habits, the way you speak, what you usually ask for, etc. What’s a bit confusing though is that Google still refuses to give its Assistant an actual name (like Siri or Alexa) to make it even more personal. We still have to resort to “Ok Google”-ing it to get some information and answers. Maybe people would use the feature more if it had a cool, fancy nickname, which the folks from Pixar and The Onion will probably have fun naming. Are you planning to get Google Home for your, well, home, soon? Would you want to have a more personal assistant, like a Jake or a Janice, or OK Google is still your jam?

Yandex woos smartphone makers with AI, browser and launcher partnership programs Posted Oct 12, 2016 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Microsoft starts selling its HoloLens in Germany, France, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand After successfully bringing a high-profile antitrust case against Google in Russia over bundling services with the Android OS, the country’s national search giant Yandex is trying to take its competitiveness in mobile up another notch. To grow its business outside of its current core market of Russia, the company launched a new partnership program to work with smartphone handset makers, where it will offer its Android launcher and browser, powered by its Yandex Zen artificial intelligence engine, as pre-loaded services, replacing products typically bundled with Google’s Android OS. Alongside basic functions like browsing the web or your apps, Yandex’s services will feature streams of content that include alerts on articles, news, videos, images, “and other stories matching personal interests in the form of an infinite feed.” Early adopters of the program include a mix of smaller handset makers and a couple of others with a significantly higher profile: Fly, LAVA, Mobile TeleSystems, Multilaser and Posh Mobile; but also Wileyfox and ZTE, who will customise the browser and launcher in varying degrees. (ZTE for example is going for a white-label offering where you would never know it was Yandex behind the scenes; others are using Yandex branding.) In all, Artem Fokin, VP for international business development at Yandex, tells me that the new devices will be sold across Europe, India, Latin America and Africa, covering about 70% of the world’s internet population. Targeting a smaller handset makers is an interesting strategy: individually, they may not be a threat to the likes of Apple or Samsung, but collectively, they make up just under half of all smartphone sales, according to Gartner. And given the economics of making smartphones at scale and needing things to differentiate from the rest of the pack, they are also the most likely candidates for trying something like this out. “Device manufacturers often have to choose between developing in-house software at a huge overhead cost or sacrificing product differentiation and additional revenue. Some OEMs pre-install as many apps as possible. Unfortunately, this has a negative effect on the user experience and is counterproductive to their brands in the long-term,” Fokin said in a statement. “Our software and artificial intelligence technology is aimed at shaking up the market and helping our partners overcome these challenges, reduce customer churn and increase profit margins.” Yandex’s bigger business impetus here is clear: the company is the biggest search engine in Russia and surrounding countries, but that holds limited scope for growth, especially in a wider global search market that has been cornered by Google. At the same time, Yandex — similarly to Google — has built a ton of technology to bolster its services in the Russian market like maps, news alerts and much more, both to grow its search revenues and to leverage some of that domination to build business in other areas. Now, given that it’s essentially lost to Google in desktop search globally, Yandex is hoping that it can build other products for other platforms where there is still room for growth and change. This is not Yandex’s first foray into tapping the growth of mobile and smartphone use as a route to growing its business outside of its home market of Russia. Back in 2014, it released Yandex.Kit, a complete firmware update that essentially replaced Google’s whole portfolio of mobile apps on Android phones. OEMs that signed on to use it included the likes of Huawei, but as Fokin pointed out to me, it was largely an effort that didn’t extend outside of the Russian market. Today’s launch is a little different, in that Yandex is not looking to take on the whole kit and caboodle on smartphones (not yet, anyway). It’s intentionally only launching two services — a browser and a launcher — and outside of a handful of its core markets like Russia, it’s not even bundling in services like Yandex Search as part of this. “Before we were focusing on our domestic market, and this was our way to distribute Yandex Search,” Fokin said. “Now we’ve made it a global product and separate from search. If it’s installed in Brazil, for example, the default search is Google, because that is what would be expected in that market.” The other reason for leaving out Yandex Search, Fokin told me, is because in most markets Yandex doesn’t have the infrastructure to monetize it in the same way that it does in its home markets. Instead, the business model behind its partnership program will be based around “ads in the most unobtrusive way,” he said. By this he means no pop-ups and with much of it coming in the form of “native content” within larger content feeds. If a user clicks on a link, Yandex and the OEM share the revenue on that. No word on what percentages the two parties have, except to say that it is “a significant portion of the revenue” and “a fair share.” Given that mobile internet browsers and smartphone launchers have been around for a while now, you may wonder what, exactly, Yandex is doing here that will be different or more attractive. Fokin tells me that this is where Yandex Zen, the AI engine, will come in: machine learning will track how you scroll and pause on certain links to read them, track what you are interested in by your browsing habits and combine that with Yandex’s bigger search index algorithms to develop an ever more accurate picture of what you might like to see, both in terms of content recommendations and ads. Early implementations of the products have already seen people spend about 20 minutes on average in Yandex’s browser and launchers, with the figure growing, he said. He added that Yandex’s AI also powers the company’s built-in ad blocking feature in the browser. By default nothing is blocked, but if a user decides to ban or block an intrusive ad, Yandex learns that and serves less of the same in the future, and also gives data to publishers so that they know what isn’t working. All of this was built in-house, he said. “We’ve been making AI and recommendation products for Yandex itself since 1997,” he said. “We think it’s some of the best on the market.” Fokin would not say what other Zen-powered services Yandex may include in the partnership program except to note that they will continue for the time being to be focused on content, with products in the general area of recommendation and discovery. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Yandex Founded 1997 Overview Yandex is one of the largest internet companies in Europe, operating Russia’s most popular search engine and its most visited website.

The company today announced version 7.1 – the same running on its new Pixel phones – will be available to beta test later this month. Though the company is calling it an incremental update, there are several significant features, some of them features you’d normally find in a version upgrade. Support for Google’s new Daydream VR platform is probably the biggest of these, but there are a few others. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Android 7.1 addresses one area Android has lagged for a while behind iOS: support for images directly in keyboards. That means you can finally get a proper GIF keyboard that doesn’t require you to paste a link or go through odd hoops just to share an image. Google is trying to make Android a bit more uniform by making all its official icons circular with the Pixel phone. Version 7.1 includes rounded icon resources for developers to match the look on the Pixel phone, as well as ‘other launchers.’ Finally, there’s an App Shortcuts API, which is basically 3D touch, without requiring a pressure sensitive screen. As shown in the header image, this will let developers add up to 5 shortcuts to homescreen apps, presumably accessible via a long-press. For more on the developer-oriented updates, head on over to the source link below, and as with the original Nougat previews, don’t be surprised if more features are added along the way. You can try out Android 7.1 later this month using the same anyone-can-join Android Beta program from the original Nougat previews. The update will be available to try for the Nexus 5X, 6P, Pixel C to start, and will extend to ‘other supported devices’ by the end of the preview.

Even the iPhone 7 Plus has them two, and many more are likely to join the list in the coming days. But the trend is not new. Before Apple told the world that two are better than one, a number of companies were already walking down this road. Although they were also travelling along in their own specific ways. Huawei was -- and is -- one of them. The company earlier came out with the Honor P9, a high-end phone with two rear cameras, which were designed in collaboration with Leica. The P9 got some rave reviews but the high-price of the phone affected its acceptance among consumers. Enters the Honor 8. The Honor 8, at least in terms of functionality, is similar to the P9. But its price is Rs 10,000 lower at Rs 29,999 in India and it has a design and finish that actually makes it look slicker, and yet more friendly to average consumers. All in all, at least on the paper, the Honor 8 is a phone aimed at users who want a good looking device at relatively more affordable prices but without any compromises on the camera. And for the most part, it succeeds. Design and build quality In the last couple of years there has been another trend, other than than two-camera trend, in the phone industry. This has been "follow the leader" trend. The leader in this case is the iPhone when it comes to the design. The Honor 8 follows the trend faithfully. It looks "oh-so-familiar". It has the same rounded edges that phones like the iPhone 6S and the Galaxy S7 sport. It has a similar metal frame with chamfered edges, the similar curved glass layer on the screen, the similar large round holes for speaker grill at the bottom edge and the similar clean back cover. This is both good and not so good. The bad part is that it makes the Honor 8 somewhat boring. But the good part is this is not a bad design. The Honor 8 is a slick phone. The basic design may be similar to almost all premium phones out there, this is also a design that works well. The curved glass on the front and back -- the phone has a glass back cover -- gives the device a look where all parts seem to meld into each other. There are no sharp or rough edges on the Honor 8. In fact, it is disconcertingly shiny and smooth. This makes the phone look extremely polished and expensive. But it also means that you will not be comfortable using the Honor 8 without a case. The Honor 8, with its 5.2-inch screen, is a relatively small phone. In fact, it is just the right size. It is easy to use and easy to carry this phone and at a time when market is full of phones with giant screens, the relatively modest and pleasant size of the Honor 8 amounts for something. The phone has a fingerprint sensor on the back, or in other words exactly in the place where it should be. Overall, the Honor 8 has a usual but likable design. The build quality is fantastic, down to the expertly carved metal buttons. It lacks some of the character that a few other Huawei phones, like the Honor P9 and Nexus 6P have, but what it loses in terms of exotic looks, it gains in the fit and finish. Without a doubt the Honor 8 is one of most well-crafted phones Huawei has ever made. Display The phone has a LCD screen that measures 5.2-inch. Given the relatively lower price of the phone, it comes with a FullHD (1080P) display and not 1440P that are now common in high-end phones. But then the smaller screen size also means that you don't really miss those extra pixels. Anyway, pixels don't matter as much as the colours and quality of screen do. That is one area where the Honor 8 is strong. Its screen shows excellent colours, which are deep and vibrant. The viewing angles too are good. But where it falters somewhat is the brightness, which is on the lower side. During indoor use, when the sun is not directly shining into the phone, the brightness is adequate. But during the outdoor use, the screen is more reflective than it ought to be. You can still read a news article or two on it while walking on a sunny beach, but you do miss the extra bit of brightness. Software Design is not the only part where we have seen the "follow" trends. Software is another one, possibly because iPhone is - or rather was - crazy popular in China. So almost all Chinese phone makers try to follow the kind of software that Apple puts in the iPhone. Huawei is no exception. The Honor 8, although an Android phones, runs a custom version of the operating system that has a completely new user interface called EMUI. In the Honor 8 you get the version 4.1 of the EMUI, which is based on Android 6. Overall the software looks closer to the iPhone's iOS and not Google's Android. But just the way it was the case with the design, with the software too similarities with the iPhone may not matter much from consumer's point of view. If you like your software uncomplicated, clean and closer to what Google puts in Nexus phones or what Motorola has in Moto phones, go for the Nexus or Moto phones. But if you like the iPhone-style software, without any app drawer, slicker animations, and iconography & typography that are closer to what Apple uses in the form of polished iOS software in the iPhone, you will love the software in the Honor 8. If you don't have a specific preference, I doubt you would care much about the software in the Honor 8. All you will care for is whether it has the necessary features or not, and that it has plenty. You can customise a number of aspects of the phone. You can fine-tune the colours the screen shows, or change the way the phone uses battery or set new themes, or customise the notification shade. Overall, the Honor 8 has a usual but likable design. The build quality is fantastic, down to the expertly carved metal buttons One good bit about the EMUI is that it looks very well optimised. It shows no apparent performance issues. Animations are slick and lag free. There is virtually no bloatware (unwanted apps) other than a few like Health, which can be uninstalled. It comes with a version of SwiftKey keyboard by default but you can easily switch to Google keyboard, something that I recommend. Personally, I am ambivalent about the software in the Honor 8. I don't mind it. It looks good enough and gets the job done. It's just that I miss a couple of things that are part of default Android. One for example, is Google Now, although I can get it with the Google Now launcher. But then much of this is because I am used to the Android on Nexus phones. If you don't have a preference, you will find the software in Honor 8 slick and good enough. The only concern here is the software update. For example, Honor 8 has software based on Android 6 at a time when Android 7 is current version of Android. But then this problem of updates afflict all Android phones, up to an extent even Nexus phones, so you can hardly fault Huawei for it. Performance and battery life With well-optimised software inside it, the Honor 8 performs like a champ. It also helps that the phone has a fantastic hardware inside it. The device is powered by Kirin 950, a processor that is made by Huawei itself. It has 4GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. You can add more storage through a microSD card if you need it. In day-to-day use, I found Honor 8 to be a fast phone. The well-optimised software means you won't see any lags on this phone and all the animations, including when you are switching between the open tabs, are smooth. During gaming too the performance is good and you can play games like Asphalt 8 at the best graphics settings without any lag. The phone also relatively stays cool even with prolonged use, so on the performance part it is easy to recommend the device. That said, it is not as speedy a phone as Huawei's own Nexus 6P, which uses Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, or for that matter phones like the OnePlus 3 and Xioami Mi 5. But it is fast enough and that matters more. The phone's speaker is decent and is loud enough to fill a small room with sound. Call quality too is good, although it is worth noting that the phone supports only one SIM card and doesn't support VoLTE, something that Jio has made nowadays popular. The Honor 8 comes with a 3000 mAh battery, which is good enough for around 12-13 hours with fairly heavy use. With a bit of care, it is easy to get around 15 hours of battery life from the phone. Camera The camera is one part of the Honor 8 that the company is highlighting heavily. In fact, it is the top feature of the phone. Reason? It is a dual-camera setup, just like what was seen on the Huawei P9. Although there are differences. Unlike the P9, there is no Leica branding on the Honor 8. That is not as big of a deal as it sounds. In the P9, Huawei had used a lens that it created in collaboration with Leica, a old and venerable camera company. But in Honor 8, it is using generic lens. The image sensor -- IMX 298 -- is however the same so the difference in image quality is negligible. The other difference is that unlike the protruding camera module in the Honor P9, the Honor 8 has lenses that sit flush with its body. Obviously, this is a better design. The Honor 8  clicks 12-megapixel images with both its cameras although one of them clicks only black & white (monochrome images). Huawei says that even when you are using the main camera, which is the one that clicks colour images, the other camera captures a lot of data, which then is used to process images so that they have better details, especially in low light. Long story short, the Honor 8 will give you quality images in good light. In low light it can't match the best in the business but is respectable enough to justify the tag of camera phone Theory apart, I found that the image quality of pictures clicked with Honor 8 is fantastic. It's not up there with the likes of the Nexus 6P, which has a bigger image sensor, but is definitely among the best. And it is very much comparable or better than what phones in the same price range can manage. The colours in images clicked with the Honor 8 are punchy, and white balance is mostly spot on. Although exposure is mostly on the lower side but then that also means Honor 8 handles tricky scenes like sunset, which have lots of dynamic light, in a better way by preserving highlights. Long story short, the Honor 8 will give you quality images in good light most of the time. In low light it can't match the best in the business, or for that matter even the OnePlus 3, but is respectable enough to justify the tag of camera phone. The selfie aka front camera too is among the better ones I have seen, especially in good light. In low light, selfies do have some noise but using features like "beautify" you can get images that are good enough for social media use. The front camera clicks 8-megapixel images. There are two more aspects of the camera that I want to highlight: the software and the focus speed. The Honor 8 camera software is a joy to use. Switching between various modes is extremely easy and modes themselves -- particularly monochrome modes -- are fun. But there is one thing that could have been better: HDR. The HDR is not available in auto. It has to be manually turned on, which I feel is something of a miss from Huawei for a phone that is supposed to excel at all things photography. Coming to the focus speed, this is big win for the Honor 8. It is one of fastest phones I have used as far as the focus speed of its camera is concerned. And it tracks moving subjects excellently, for a phone. For example, see the photo of the dog running on the beach. Most phones would struggle to freeze the frame in shot. X PreviousNext Should you buy it? Yes and no. In India, the Huawei Honor 8 has a price of Rs 29,999. If you are going to spend this much money on a phone, the OnePlus 3 is a better deal compared to the Honor 8. But that is more due to the fact that the OnePlus phone is just as tremendous. It's not that the Honor 8 is lacking in any significant way. It is one of the best phones we have seen from Huawei, it's just that on occasions even the best is not enough. With that said, there are reasons to get the Honor 8, if you are into it. If you like its design, go for it. It will delight you with its premium finish and a comfortable-to-use compact design. If you want a phone that can click some great pictures and don't want to spend more than Rs 30,000, go for the Huawei Honor 8.  Similarly, if you like the software and design of the iPhone, but want it with Android features, go for the Honor 8. It will most likely delight you. To sum it up, the Honor 8 may not be the best phone in its price range but it is surely among the best ones. It doesn't have everything and it is not the right phone for everyone but it has enough in it to be on the shortlist of all phone buyers.

It’s flat. Welcome to Doha and men’s individual time trial. Rohan Dennis, Tony Martin and Tom Dumoulin are expected to be among the frontrunners here, hoping to claim the title that Vasil Kiryienka claimed last year in Richmond, Virginia, USA. If that was a more classic course, this is a new challenge. Flat as a pancake, the 40km course will favour the most powerful riders and sprinters, who may have to battle crosswinds in the middle part of the course. Men’s time trial course in Doha.

Yandex woos smartphone makers with AI, browser and launcher partnership programs Posted Oct 12, 2016 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Microsoft starts selling its HoloLens in Germany, France, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand After successfully bringing a high-profile antitrust case against Google in Russia over bundling services with the Android OS, the country’s national search giant Yandex is trying to take its competitiveness in mobile up another notch. To grow its business outside of its current core market of Russia, the company launched a new partnership program to work with smartphone handset makers, where it will offer its Android launcher and browser, powered by its Yandex Zen artificial intelligence engine, as pre-loaded services, replacing products typically bundled with Google’s Android OS. Alongside basic functions like browsing the web or your apps, Yandex’s services will feature streams of content that include alerts on articles, news, videos, images, “and other stories matching personal interests in the form of an infinite feed.” Early adopters of the program include a mix of smaller handset makers and a couple of others with a significantly higher profile: Fly, LAVA, Mobile TeleSystems, Multilaser and Posh Mobile; but also Wileyfox and ZTE, who will customise the browser and launcher in varying degrees. (ZTE for example is going for a white-label offering where you would never know it was Yandex behind the scenes; others are using Yandex branding.) In all, Artem Fokin, VP for international business development at Yandex, tells me that the new devices will be sold across Europe, India, Latin America and Africa, covering about 70% of the world’s internet population. Targeting a smaller handset makers is an interesting strategy: individually, they may not be a threat to the likes of Apple or Samsung, but collectively, they make up just under half of all smartphone sales, according to Gartner. And given the economics of making smartphones at scale and needing things to differentiate from the rest of the pack, they are also the most likely candidates for trying something like this out. “Device manufacturers often have to choose between developing in-house software at a huge overhead cost or sacrificing product differentiation and additional revenue. Some OEMs pre-install as many apps as possible. Unfortunately, this has a negative effect on the user experience and is counterproductive to their brands in the long-term,” Fokin said in a statement. “Our software and artificial intelligence technology is aimed at shaking up the market and helping our partners overcome these challenges, reduce customer churn and increase profit margins.” Yandex’s bigger business impetus here is clear: the company is the biggest search engine in Russia and surrounding countries, but that holds limited scope for growth, especially in a wider global search market that has been cornered by Google. At the same time, Yandex — similarly to Google — has built a ton of technology to bolster its services in the Russian market like maps, news alerts and much more, both to grow its search revenues and to leverage some of that domination to build business in other areas. Now, given that it’s essentially lost to Google in desktop search globally, Yandex is hoping that it can build other products for other platforms where there is still room for growth and change. This is not Yandex’s first foray into tapping the growth of mobile and smartphone use as a route to growing its business outside of its home market of Russia. Back in 2014, it released Yandex.Kit, a complete firmware update that essentially replaced Google’s whole portfolio of mobile apps on Android phones. OEMs that signed on to use it included the likes of Huawei, but as Fokin pointed out to me, it was largely an effort that didn’t extend outside of the Russian market. Today’s launch is a little different, in that Yandex is not looking to take on the whole kit and caboodle on smartphones (not yet, anyway). It’s intentionally only launching two services — a browser and a launcher — and outside of a handful of its core markets like Russia, it’s not even bundling in services like Yandex Search as part of this. “Before we were focusing on our domestic market, and this was our way to distribute Yandex Search,” Fokin said. “Now we’ve made it a global product and separate from search. If it’s installed in Brazil, for example, the default search is Google, because that is what would be expected in that market.” The other reason for leaving out Yandex Search, Fokin told me, is because in most markets Yandex doesn’t have the infrastructure to monetize it in the same way that it does in its home markets. Instead, the business model behind its partnership program will be based around “ads in the most unobtrusive way,” he said. By this he means no pop-ups and with much of it coming in the form of “native content” within larger content feeds. If a user clicks on a link, Yandex and the OEM share the revenue on that. No word on what percentages the two parties have, except to say that it is “a significant portion of the revenue” and “a fair share.” Given that mobile internet browsers and smartphone launchers have been around for a while now, you may wonder what, exactly, Yandex is doing here that will be different or more attractive. Fokin tells me that this is where Yandex Zen, the AI engine, will come in: machine learning will track how you scroll and pause on certain links to read them, track what you are interested in by your browsing habits and combine that with Yandex’s bigger search index algorithms to develop an ever more accurate picture of what you might like to see, both in terms of content recommendations and ads. Early implementations of the products have already seen people spend about 20 minutes on average in Yandex’s browser and launchers, with the figure growing, he said. He added that Yandex’s AI also powers the company’s built-in ad blocking feature in the browser. By default nothing is blocked, but if a user decides to ban or block an intrusive ad, Yandex learns that and serves less of the same in the future, and also gives data to publishers so that they know what isn’t working. All of this was built in-house, he said. “We’ve been making AI and recommendation products for Yandex itself since 1997,” he said. “We think it’s some of the best on the market.” Fokin would not say what other Zen-powered services Yandex may include in the partnership program except to note that they will continue for the time being to be focused on content, with products in the general area of recommendation and discovery. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Yandex Founded 1997 Overview Yandex is one of the largest internet companies in Europe, operating Russia’s most popular search engine and its most visited website.

ADVERTISEMENT To celebrate the launch of HoloLens in the UK, Microsoft recently transformed its London offices into a holographic hub and WIRED was invited to put the headset through its paces. But is Microsoft late to the party, or could HoloLens revolutionise the AR and VR industry? The most striking thing about Microsoft's HoloLens is its design. Aesthetically it's part VR headset, part Google Glass, part Geordi La Forge's visor in Star Trek. You have to fit the band to your head first, using an incredibly easy-to-use winding mechanism – this certainly beats the clips and bands used by the likes of Oculus and Google's Daydream VR – and once secure, you can move the visor down over your eyes and back and forth to sit comfortably and snug to your face. Read more Microsoft HoloLens finally comes to the UK Microsoft HoloLens finally comes to the UK By Victoria Woollaston We also had our Interpupillary distance (IPD) measured (ours was 56.5 which we were told is 'perfectly average.') Put simply, this is the distance between the centre of the pupils of your two eyes, and HoloLens uses this to place holograms in the best position for your individual eyesight. WIRED It took a little adjusting to fit 'just right' but we imagine this would get easier with practice, and once it was set up, you'd need to do little adjusting each time you put the headset back on. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Microsoft is betting that bots 'are the new apps' Microsoft is betting that bots 'are the new apps' By Matthew Reynolds Microsoft HoloLens finally comes to the UK Microsoft HoloLens finally comes to the UK Hololens 12 Oct 2016 Due to the extra band, the HoloLens felt secure on our head and, despite being incredibly heavy (at 579g), the weight felt more evenly distributed than with the Oculus, for example, which weighs 440g without a cable. And when it comes to the HoloLens, that final caveat is key. HoloLens isn't a peripheral; it doesn't need a phone to get online, nor does it need cables to work. The first 'experience' we were given was called 'Life with holograms' and it was designed to showcase how HoloLens could be used in the home to see how virtual ornaments, paintings, furniture and more would look. ADVERTISEMENT Read more HoloLens Actiongram fills your home with zombies HoloLens Actiongram fills your home with zombies By K.G Orphanides At the press of a virtual button, which Microsoft calls an 'air tap', you can pick paintings from an online store, try various positions around your home and buy the artwork within seconds, using just a few gestures. Many of these gestures are natural evolutions of the types of gestures you use on touchscreens, meaning HoloLens is incredibly easy to use and accurate when registering these gestures. In the 'Life with holograms' demo, there was also a design app store in which you can select dinosaurs, or zombies, that come to life in front of your eyes. WIRED The next demo showcased HoloLens' potential in medicine and medical training. Having previously seen a video showing students studying bone fractures and heart valves beating, this was the demo we were most excited about, and it didn't disappoint. There is something incredible about seeing organs, muscles, bones and even the digestive tract in stunning detail, close up. Watching a cross section of a heart beating was breathtaking – and we don't use that word lightly. Read more HoloLens will only have a 5.5 hour battery life HoloLens will only have a 5.5 hour battery life By Matt Burgess The demo we experienced matched the promotional video released by Case Western University and this is rare. However, we hadn't noticed some of the restrictions in that video and these didn't become apparent until we had the demo. Microsoft For example, we (wrongly) assumed the skeleton would appear in full, in front of our eyes but given the rectangular nature of the visor and displays on HoloLens, only certain parts appear at one time. This means having to exaggeratedly look up and down and tilt our heads to uncomfortable angles to see all the details. This was also a problem during a scaled-back demonstration of the Galaxy Explorer app, which lets you view the solar system in front of your eyes. Our eyes dart around naturally so having them relatively restricted was both metaphorically and physically painful. Onto a Skype demo, this is where the technology came into its own. By video calling an electrician called Dave, who was, in fact, a Microsoft employee, we were taken through a step-by-step guide to fitting a new light switch. Dave was able to see everything we could see and annotate instructions on top of the images.

He then guided us through the makeshift house to the fuse box and told us which switch to flick; an example of where the wireless nature of HoloLens became most noticeable. We were also shown how engineers for large firms, the example being thyssenKrupp, could use HoloLens in a similar way to fix elevators, see schematics, watch tutorials and Skype for advice all hands-free. ADVERTISEMENT Microsoft And this latter demonstration is where Microsoft is focusing its attention. Having launched its Enterprise and Developer models in the US and Canada last year aimed at businesses, these versions are now headed to the Europe. They're still not available to everyday consumers, and Microsoft would not be drawn on when a consumer version would be ready. Microsoft was keen to stress that HoloLens is 'mixed reality' and doesn't sit in exactly the same market as Oculus, HTC Vive, Epson's Moverio BT-300 or Google Cardboard. But the similarities remain. Microsoft told us that it's important to explore its uses for businesses first, refine the headset and increase the number of apps available before launching to consumers, but the longer they take to go on general sale, the further it seems the ship will have sailed containing many of its rival devices. The device costs £2,719 in the UK and $3,000 in the US. It is available to pre-order from today and will ship in November.

TechCrunch was perhaps first to spot the ad while noting that it only appears on the Google home page for US desktop users. Could Google reach more people by including mobile as well? Of course — but Google still accounts for 64% of desktop search share with more than 10 billion searches per month. Google has made efforts in the past to encourage voter registration, but nothing to the extent of putting a pop-up ad right on the home page. The closest it has come to that was a Google Doodle last month which appeared on the day before National Voter Registration Day. Googles pop-up ad reads: “Make sure you’re registered to vote”. The following options are “No Thanks” or “Learn How”. Clicking “No Thanks” will dismiss the ad, while clicking “Learn How” will direct you to voter registration information compiled by Google. According to Twitter user Sara Robertson, Google takes it a step further with a more urgent reminder when it’s the last day to register to vote in your state: the @google homepage reminding everyone in Texas that today is the last day to register to vote. Nicely done! pic.twitter.com/T2swh3prgT — Sara Robertson (@bonitasarita) October 11, 2016 For a company which has built a reputation on maintaining a clean and simple home page, this is an unusual action for the search giant to take. However, Google is far from being the only tech company to encourage voter registration during the 2016 general election.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Android 7.1 Developer Preview to be released soon By R Padla - October 12, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We think it’s good that Google released the Android N Developer Preview and launched the Nougat earlier this year. This way, more devices can get their updates also earlier than usual. It’s not always easy for OEMs and mobile carriers to work on each and every update but at least, the chunky Android has got a head start. While other phones are still waiting for Marshmallow, here is Nougat being prepped for 7.1 already. The Pixel and Pixel XL phones were rumored to have Android 7.1 at launch and then just last week, an Android 7.1 changelog shows Pixel exclusive and non-exclusive features. Google has officially announced the Android 7.1 Nougat. It comes with new features that will benefit more developers and consumers. Expect A/B system, Daydream VR support, image keyboard support, and app shortcuts. The tech giant has started working with other companies to prepare their devices for the new version. Consumers will soon be able to access the Android 7.1 Developer Preview. You can test the new Nougat and start building on it. You can already try all features but through Android Beta only. Expect improved performance, security, and productivity of the earlier Nougat but with new APIs, features, and several bug fixes. Android 7.1 brings the App shortcuts API (API level 25) that lets developers to surface key actions directly in the launcher. This can take app users deep into your app quickly. Shortcuts can be created dynamically or statically. The Circular app icons support allows you to make rounded icon resources that will match the Pixel and the launchers. There’s also the enhanced live wallpaper metadata that allows you to provide metadata (label, author, and description) about your live wallpapers plus a URL to link. Other important developer features added to Android 7.1 include image keyboard support and Storage Manager Intent. The latter allows the app to take the user straight to ‘Settings’ to free up space and clear unused files. Developers can test their apps on the Developer Preview and take advantage of the SDK, APIs, emulators, device system images, tools, samples, and documentation. Check Android Beta if you want to automatically get the Developer Preview on your Pixel C, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 5X. Future updates will be ready for the Nexus, 6, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL, and Android One devices.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Penguin is Now a Real-Time Component of Google’s Core Algorithm News  SEO September 23, 2016 News SEO Matt SouthernSeptember 23, 2016 SEJ STAFF 1.6KSHARES 9.0KREADS 1.6KSHARES 9.0KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 1.6KSHARES 9.0KREADS Penguin is now running in real-time as a part of Google’s core algorithm. The update goes into effect today in all languages. Here’s what else has changed, which is based on some of the top requests from webmasters: Real-time Updates Before today’s update, all sites affected by Penguin would get refreshed at the same time. It wasn’t until a Penguin update occurred that those sites affected by it would be able to recover. This can become problematic when you consider the last update to Penguin was over 700 days ago. With Penguin running in real-time changes, both positive and negative, will occur much faster. Google says the length of time between seeing Penguin changes will be roughly the length of time it takes to crawl and re-index a page. Learn more about Google’s Penguin algorithm here. More Granular Rather than affecting the ranking of an entire website, Penguin now devalues spam by affecting the ranking of individual pages based on spam signals. About Penguin Penguin was introduced by Google as a standalone algorithm update in 2012. It is designed to devalue pages which engage in spammy link building practices for the purposes of ranking higher in search. Penguin received periodic updates throughout the years, but still ran separately from Google’s core algorithm. Now, Penguin is part of the over 200 signals used in Google’s core algorithm. With that being the case, we’ll begin to see Penguin-like updates more frequently. As far as Google is concerned, the company is not going to make any further comments about. “…we’re not going to comment on future refreshes,” the company says. Want to learn more about what this change means for your brand? Join us in NYC for SEJ Summit on November 2nd, 2016.

This affects all keyword rankings, both past and present. Danisa Reis some of my keyword has disappear from search, is this the reason? is there any way to get out from this? Vikram Rathore Stay away from craps. Don’t build the links just start to earn them and result will be remarkable. Try It 🙂 Ozair Akhtar (Oxair Online) I had been telling everyone in Seroundtable that it might be a Penguin update coming and we are experiencing it’s initial effect. But everyone was literally laughing at me…. Now, here we go. Penguin become part of the core Algorithm. I love one thing in this: Now, Penguin will effect only a particular page that has higher spam ration and not the whole domain. You can follow me: fb(dot)com/oxair(dot)online Alex – New Frontiers Marketing Wow, big news. I like the sounds of this new development; seeing quicker rises and falls in rankings will allow us to more directly identify which of our actions have affected our positions in the serps, and by devaluing individual pages instead of the whole domain due to spam signals, this allows for more meritocratic serps where good pages on bad domains can still rank high, if they deserve to do so. barry w amato I grew tired of Google and other Search Engines Long Ago. I write to my audience, small as it may be, not Google. They may rank my pages/posts or not. I went into this to quit jumping through hoops not to change the hoops I am jumping through. SEO, Penguin, Eskimos, Lions and Tiger and Bears. Can you say PPC. I knew you could. Barry Danisa Reis You are on rock.. Adeel Sami Looks to be much better now as it is deployed in real-time! Now, the quality will dominate over everything! Joseph Franklin this is a good news thats the thing which is expected from the google. Pratik Joshi Where is official confirmation from Google about Panda algorithm . Kelsey Jones This is about Penguin, something different. 🙂 Michail Dimitriou 1. What about the disavow tool? They did not mention it. 2. “will be roughly the length of time it takes to crawl and re-index a page.” –> if a spamy link been very deep in an old page, even if the link or the page does not exist anymore the googlebot will make years to re-visit and re-index again. Janaki Raman Did Google officially confirmed about this penguin update? My website goes down from 3 to 10. This is the major reason for this changes. semalaia4n Your blog is very intereting. Penguin update coming and we are experiencing it’s initial effect.Thanks for sharing the post. A4N Penguin update coming and we are experiencing it’s initial effect.Did Google officially confirmed about this penguin Abhishek My site got penalized in this update, can anyone help me in this regard? I have been blogging from last 3 years and in this blog I do not have any copied content. Any help would be great appreciated, site is top10reviewz(dot)in Vikram Rathore Hello Abhishek, As the Penguin bust the websites which have spam back-links or unnatural back-links assets. So at very initial start from the back-links analysis of your website and filter the links which are coming from poor website, exact match keywords, low directories, deindexed website and other bad quality links. After this you can remove those particular links which are toxic to the website. hicabs.in There is no major changes in search algorithm Riya Sharma Interesting thing…. Nice article Keep sharing such kinda useful information jackluter I have few changes in my ranking. Cameron Francis I am interested to see the impact Penguin 4.0 on the serps. So far I have not seen much + or – for our accounts. Vikram Rathore Hey Cameron. Hope it will go positive for your accounts. Futiq Technologies I followed the penguin 4.0 but still my website ranking is not increase. Vikram Rathore It will not remain the same because your moving from one to another domain. It’s highly recommended to perform 301 redirection from source to target landing pages. I am sure it will help you. You can also Google it to know more about domain transfer. Ataul Ghani Thank you! Vikram Rathore Well Said @disqus_xQeuizBHQh:disqus. Quality content and it’s well parking is the best way to dominate spam and rule the SERP. Antonio Raphael Caballes Thank you for sharing this.

A number of Google Cast users have been informed that the app will soon be called "Google Home", according to Variety. The new branding will bring the Google Chromecast media streamer and the Google Home smart speaker under the same software banner, alongside a number of other Cast-friendly devices. Google Cast is Google’s Chromecast mobile app, available across Android and iOS. It was originally called "Chromecast", but was renamed as other devices – such as third-party televisions – began to support the technology. According to Google, the rebranded Google Home app will let users “discover new content and manage Google Home assistant and Cast devices”. Related: Chromecast 4K Ultra vs Chromecast 2 We first heard the name "Google Home" earlier this year, when Google unveiled the eponymous smart speaker at its I/O developer conference. The speaker is a direct rival to the Amazon Echo, and features the Google Assistant digital helper – it’s a little like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortana. Google Home is built on the same core technologies as Chromecast and, like the streamer, will feature Cast support, allowing device owners to beam media to their TV or speakers over a Wi-Fi connection simply by using voice commands. Google Home is currently available to pre-order for $129 over in the US, with a release date set for 4 November. It isn't yet available in the UK right now, but Google says it “hopes to make [Google Home] available in the future” in Britain.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Report Google Is Going to Spend Large Amounts of Money Promoting Its Pixel lineup By Omar Sohail Posted 1 month ago 21Shares Share Tweet Submit Google wants you to know that Pixel phones exist and while the smartphone populace is well aware of their presence, it’s the list of features that the tech giant also wants to highlight in selling as many units as possible. According to one analyst, both Pixel and Pixel XL are expected to sell 4 million units this year, but in order to achieve that mark, some serious advertising is going to have to take place. Google Has Already Spent $3.2 Million USD in Television Ads in Two Days Since the Pixel Devices Were Officially Announced – More Funds to Follow Google isn’t a known manufacturer for its hardware products, but according to Rachel Pasqua, practice lead at a New York-based advertising agency states how the company is intending to make its mark: “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands.” Though Google’s Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz has told sources to the matter that the company is going to commence a heavy campaigning spree for its Pixel phones, the exact amount was not detailed. However, he did say that the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games, which can go up to a million dollars. Google is most likely going to rival the spending amount of its smartphone rivals Apple and Samsung. According to iSpot.tv, Apple has spent $2.45 million while Samsung has spent a total of $1.4 million USD in just marketing its flagship devices. Unfortunately, it’s not the features that will trouble Google later on, but the pricing at which both its Pixel and Pixel XL are selling at. The base model is retailing for $649, which will give the impression that these devices are not going to have a bright future. Well, it turns out that both the 32 and 128GB models have been sold out at the Google Store, and it might take a while to restock them. Advertisement It’s honestly hard to believe that Android-powered smartphones that cost the same as an iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus according to their respective storage models will sell well, but it looks like when consumers have money to spend, there’s no stopping them. Even in a recent poll, where the Pixel and Pixel XL’s hardware specifications when compared to the rest of the flagship crew, it was hard to believe that Pixel carried the highest number of votes for consumers when they were asked which flagship phone would they upgrade to next. Do you guys think that marketing campaigns from Google will help the tech giant to sell its Pixel phones at a better rate? Tell us your thoughts right away.

ADVERTISEMENT Version 7.1 of Android's Nougat OS will be available through the beta scheme and offer a number of updates to those creating apps and working with the platform. Android's VP of engineering, Dave Burke, explained in a blog post: "Android 7.1 is an incremental release, but it’s always important to make sure your apps look and run great — especially as devices start to reach consumers," he said in the post.

Here are its best new features Android Nougat starts rolling out to Nexus devices. Here are its best new features Android 22 Aug 2016 Most notably is support for Daydream, Google's new VR platform and handset. While there's only a limited number of handsets the Daydream viewer will work with, it will be one of the first glimpses inside the system. Elsewhere in the 7.1 preview is a shortcut API that allows apps to be quickly opened from the launcher, support for circular app icons (which were first revealed in the new Pixel phones), and new metadata for live wallpapers.

"For carriers and calling apps, the platform includes new APIs to support multi-endpoint calling and new telephony configuration options," Google said. What is missing from the preview may also be telling. There's no support or access to the code for a staple of Google's Pixel phones and Home product: its artificial intelligence-powered Assistant.

The Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C devices will all be the first to benefit from the preview. Other devices that support Nougat will be included in the preview when Android 7.1.x is released in December. At that point, the Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Player, Android One devices and the Pixel and Pixel XL devices will have the updates. As for consumers, Google said it is working to bring Android 7.1 to supported phones "over the months ahead". Android Nougat (7.0) started rolling out to supported Nexus devices in August. The biggest additions to the new operating system include multi-tasking apps, new emoji, a quick settings menu, file-based encryption and a boosted battery life. How to join the Android Beta programme To get the latest Android releases before they are rolled out to everyone it is possible to join the Beta programme. The scheme lets users with supported devices receive downloads of the latest "pre-release" versions of Android. ADVERTISEMENT As these aren't complete and fully tested versions of the operating system, there may be bugs in the code. Errors and defects can "affect normal functioning of your device". To become part of the beta programme a Google account and supported device is needed. The Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One) are all supported. One a user has signed-up through the beta page and accessed it on a mobile phone, over-the-air updates will be pushed to devices. "You will receive a preview update every four to six weeks until the public launch," Google added. It can take up to 24 hours to receive the latest download once a user has signed-up to the scheme.

The supermarket’s main supplier, Unilever has halted deliveries of a range of goods blaming the fall in the pound. A source accused Unilever of “using Brexit as an excuse to raise prices”.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.58pm EDT 14:58 Pound drops further after Davis hints UK could leave single market Here’s an excerpt from my colleague Phillip Inman’s piece on how the pound has dropped even further: A brief rally in the pound was quickly reversed on Wednesday after the government refused to make tariff-free access to the European Union’s single market a red line in Brexit negotiations with Brussels. Investors sold the pound after Brexit minister David Davis told MPs it was “not black or white” whether the UK would stay in the single market. Sterling fell two cents to $1.21 on the currency markets in afternoon trading, reversing a jump to $1.23 overnight that followed Theresa May’s concession for parliament to hold a debate on the government’s stance on talks with the EU. The U-turn in agreeing to a debate initially lifted markets, but the refusal of ministers to clarify the government’s position provoked a swift reversal in sentiment and the pound ended the day at $1.22. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.48pm EDT 14:48 Thangam Debbonaire, a Labour MP, used her speech to discuss the importance of freedom of movement. She ended her speech by saying: If the government want to jettison all of that, the secretary of state should at least have had the courtesy to inform the British people what they were risking. The government should respect the sovereignty of this Parliament, which Brexit campaigners made so much of. Does the secretary of state really want to throw all that away? It is clear to me that they have no plan for the future of this country, and if they throw it all away, without debate, without proper scrutiny and without the full participation of the British people, my constituents and the country will never forgive them. Updated at 2.48pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.46pm EDT 14:46 Former cabinet member and Conservative MP, Maria Miller, is concerned that the British parliament is coming across as arrogant. She said this during her speech earlier: There is an arrogance creeping into the debate today that we should take great care about, because only one certainty is coming from the referendum decision in June: the vote to leave the EU – I put it on record that I was a remainer – and nothing else is certain at this point. Members on both sides have advocated membership of or freedom to trade in the single market, freedom of movement, or no freedom of movement. Our EU partners listening today may be forgiven for thinking that there is more than a touch of arrogance coming from the British parliament, but the truth is that it is all up for grabs, and it is not for us to determine the outcome at this stage. We may well continue trading in the single market – I certainly hope so – but that is what this negotiation is all about. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.24pm EDT 14:24 In his speech earlier, Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative MP, said it only appeared like his constituency voted to remain because the result had been “infected” by the votes cast in the city of Bath. The leading leave campaigner was told by Labour’s Chris Bryant that his north east Somerset constituency had voted to stay in the EU. But Rees-Mogg blamed “urbanites” for the result. Intervening on Rees-Mogg, Bryant said: “You and I are in rather similar positions. The Rhondda voted to leave but I support remain. north east Somerset voted to remain but you supported leave. Do you fully accept that given what you have said about sovereignty that all of us in this house are not sent as delegates, we are here as representatives and we owe to our constituents our conscience as much as our vote?” But Rees-Mogg prompted laughter across the House as he replied: You should check the record. Unfortunately north east Somerset was not counted separately. We were infected by the votes of people in Bath. I’m pretty confident that the wise people of rural Somerset voted to leave whilst the urbanites in Bath voted to remain. He’s been accused of being an isolationist by Labour MP Liz McInnes on Twitter. Liz McInnes (@LizMcInnesMP) Jacob Rees-Mogg claims that his constituency voted remain because they were "infected by the people of Bath."

The motion, which was changed to include the government’s amendment, was passed unopposed. I will continue to post highlights from earlier speeches. Here’s more from Dominic Grieve, a Conservative MP: I don’t have a prescriptive view as to what it should be, I’m quite happy to debate those issues and to listen to colleagues. But what I am not prepared to do, and I say this with emphasis, is to have options closed down by diktat from wherever that may come, and I’m sorry to have to say, whether that be colleagues or the executive, on this matter. They will have to be debated in this House, and this House will have to give its approval. Mr Grieve also said he was worried at the “accepted euphoria that has followed this process” and warned of the legal quagmire that lays ahead. He said: “I have to say – I hope I am not too gloomy – that I see it as fraught with risk. There is the risk of the economic damage. I have to say as a lawyer I see the repeal process and our leaving as being a legal nightmare, one that is going to take up an endless amount of this House’s time, and to the prejudice of many of the other priorities on which we should be focused. It undoubtedly impinges on the devolution settlements and competence, we have a duty to maintain legal certainty and the rule of law which will be jeopardised in the process, there are private legal rights that are likely to be affected – some of which may lead to litigation and claims for compensation.” Updated at 2.34pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.56pm EDT 13:56 Spelling out in fine detail what goes on in the negotiations is not realistic, says David Jones. He says they have already set out the broad terms of what Brexit will look like. The house, he says, will be engaged in the process. The government agrees a balance needs to be struck. Updated at 1.56pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.53pm EDT 13:53 David Jones, minister of state for exiting the European Union, is speaking now.

Updated at 2.30pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.44pm EDT 13:44 Barry Gardiner, shadow international trade secretary, is speaking now. He says he accepts that we can’t have a running commentary on the Brexit process but the prime minister must provide a coherent and reasoned picture of what sort of future it wants for its citizens. Everyone expects that negotiations will be tough but this does not stop the government from being clear about its objectives, he says. Parliament must be part of the process, he adds. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.37pm EDT 13:37 Stephen Kinnock, another Labour MP, is speaking now. Rebuilding public trust in politicians and healing a fractured and divided society, must both be at the top of the government’s agenda, he says. Demanding a parliamentary vote on Brexit is not a ploy to overturn the referendum vote, he says as his Labour colleagues nod. It must happen but it must be subject to the democratic process. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.23pm EDT 13:23 This is what Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, said in his speech earlier: “Not only was I a Remainer, I am a Remainer and I’ll remain a Remainer until my dying day.” Updated at 1.28pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.16pm EDT 13:16 Nic Dakin, a Labour MP, says nobody knows what Brexit actually means. Like beauty, it is in the eye of the beholder, he says. People want to come out but they don’t want to lose out, he says. People expect MPs to manage these contradictions and try and square the circle. We must listen to those who didn’t vote to leave, he says. That doesn’t mean overturning the vote but doing what’s in the best interests of everybody. He ends his passionate speech mid-sentence by saying, I think that will do actually, and sits down. Updated at 1.16pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.59pm EDT 12:59 The people of Teesside voted to leave the EU but they did not vote to give the government a blank cheque, says Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, who just made her speech. She wants to know that the British steel industry will be protected and rebuilt post-EU, and that parliament will have a say in trade deals. A hard Brexit could be disastrous for Teesside, she says. Adding that subsidies supporting Teesside’s economy will still be crucial. Updated at 3.01pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.48pm EDT 12:48 Liz Kendall, the Labour MP, is speaking now. She is reminding everyone of the state of the sterling. The government should pay attention but they are not, she says. She also reminds everyone that this will have an impact everyone, not just those going on foreign holidays. The prime minister, she says, has failed to recognise that the fall in sterling has benefitted the asset-rich while those who are poor suffer as the cost of everyday products rise. Updated at 1.18pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.38pm EDT 12:38 As promised earlier, here is an extract from Ed Miliband’s speech near the start of the debate. He said the country was “deeply divided” and politicians had to try to bring it together. It is up to all of us to try to heal the divisions. Now, from my side, remain, and for my part, I believe it mean we should accept the result of the referendum as part of trying to bridge that divide. The people voted, and we should accept the result. But, if I can put it this way, the humility of those who lost should be matched by the magnanimity of those who won. As I think about my responsibilities, I do say to the people who voted leave and were successful, they should think about the remain people in our country who feel lost and wonder is there a place for them in Britain after Brexit. Responsibilities lie on both sides. And, if I can say in passing, we should stop impugning the motives of each other. The vast majority of those who voted to leave did not do so because of prejudice. And those who are now advocating proper scrutiny and consent of this parliament are not doing so, as the Daily Mail says today, because they want to reverse the vote. It’s for much deeper reasons than that. It’s about the mandate from this referendum. That’s all from me, Andrew Sparrow, for this afternoon. My colleague Nicola Slawson is taking over now to cover the rest of the debate.
