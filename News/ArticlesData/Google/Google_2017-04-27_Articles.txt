Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. "Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (http://bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate," dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager.   CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google's non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. "We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business," Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors' concerns about Google's dependence on search, Wang said. "We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company," he said. "That is quite an impressive achievement." On the other hand, Alphabet's "Other Bets"--separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily--continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down."

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Tech Giants Alphabet and Amazon Extend Earnings Boom ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Tech Giants Alphabet and Amazon Extend Earnings Boom By Rolfe Winkler and Laura Stevens Published April 27, 2017 Features Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. reported booming quarterly sales and profits, showing that the tech giants continue to extend their dominance and shuck off concerns that might have dampened growth. Continue Reading Below Alphabet on Thursday said net profit in the latest period grew 29%, with no indications yet of an impact from a backlash that began late in the quarter from advertisers worried about their brands appearing near objectionable content online. Amazon, meanwhile, said first-quarter profit jumped 41%, marking its eighth straight quarter in the black, even as it continues to pour investment into expansion in new areas. Amazon's longest earnings streak since 2012 affirmed confidence among investors -- who had already driven its shares up 53% in the past year -- that Amazon has turned into a profit machine as well as a growth machine. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said success in its core operations is helping it expand in other areas. "The strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams," she said. Strong results from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. provided further evidence that technology's juggernauts have nurtured businesses they helped found, such as cloud computing, e-commerce and online advertising, into full industries. Still, the industry is entering a time period of heavier investments as autonomous vehicles, drones and robots take off, which analysts warn could consume more capital resources. And the increasingly prominent position the tech giants occupy in society as well as in business exposes them to new kinds of risks, such as the broadcasting of violent episodes on Facebook Inc.'s live video tool. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A fuller picture of the tech industry's health will come next week when Apple Inc. and Facebook report quarterly results. Amazon and Alphabet's stocks hit new highs in after-hours trading. The boost to Alphabet's market cap was about $25 billion -- equivalent to the value of Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, the mobile messaging service that went public last month. "They're becoming bigger and bigger and their growth rates are unchanged, " said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, noting that Alphabet has increased revenue in its core segment by at least 20% every quarter for seven straight years and Amazon has done the same for over four years. Google credited its growth to the strength of its advertising business on mobile phones and on its YouTube video site. It seemed to avert a crisis when advertisers discovered in recent weeks that their brands appeared alongside offensive content on YouTube. Major companies including Coca-Cola Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pulled their ad spending from Google except for targeted search ads. That boycott didn't dent Google's growth: Advertising revenue jumped 19% in the first quarter to $21.4 billion. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said the company had done "thousands and thousands of calls" with advertisers to address the issue, pointing to new "safeguards" to address their concerns. The impact of the protest could be felt more in the second quarter, if it picks up steam. In recent years, Google's growth engine has shifted from its traditional search advertising on desktop computers to mobile advertising, YouTube and automated ad-buying systems. The number of paid clicks on Google's ads soared 44% in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period, benefiting from rising mobile-first internet usage. Google has come to dominate the online advertising market along with Facebook. The digital giants accounted for an estimated 77% of the U.S. online advertising market in 2016, up from 72% the year before, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, analyzing data published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Google and Facebook captured 99% of the online ad industry's revenue growth in 2016, estimated Mr. Wieser. On balance the rest of the industry was flat. The question plaguing Amazon was whether the online retail giant could sustain its growth despite substantial spending on everything from international expansion to video content. Amazon has long plowed most of its revenue back into product development and operations, including massive warehouses to speed products to customers. In recent periods Amazon has shown some spending discipline while it expands its operations overseas, bolsters its shipping infrastructure and broadens its library of movies and shows. Analysts expect the phase to last at least through mid-2018, in part due to Amazon's promise to hire 130,000 U.S. workers during that time frame. A big piece of that spending is coming in international markets like Mexico and India, where the company is building out its Prime offerings and competing against heavily entrenched incumbents. The international business has been stuck in the red in recent quarters. That remained the case in the first quarter, as the division reported an operating loss of $481 million. Sales increased 15.6% to $11.06 billion. Amazon's financial chief, Brian Olsavsky, said the company is boosting investments in a number of areas, including in video content, its Echo personal-assistant speakers and its Prime subscription program. Amazon is also investing heavily in warehouses due to strong growth for its business fulfilling orders for sellers on its site. "We're continuing to look for things that customers love, that can grow to be large, that we think will provide strong financial returns in the long run, and that also can last for decades," Mr. Olsavsky said. One of those areas is transportation. The retail giant has also started laying the groundwork for its own shipping business to add capacity for itself, with the grander ambition of one day hauling and delivering packages for itself, other retailers and consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. In the first quarter, Amazon said it is building its first air hub in Kentucky. It is also planning to add airfreight capacity for Chinese customers. The company is leasing up to 40 planes, with 18 planes currently in service, and has more than 4,000 dedicated truck trailer hitches as it aims to move more of its goods itself. And it has rolled out delivery in as little as an hour to more than 45 cities across eight countries. Shipping costs rose 34% in the first quarter to $4.38 billion, a lower rate compared with a year ago. "The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up and we think the cost is very good," Mr. Olsavsky said. Analysts flagged one concern for Amazon in the quarter: Growth in the company's all-important Amazon Web Services division continued to shrink. The decade-old cloud-services operation, which rents computing power to a variety of startups, government agencies and other corporations, has become a major factor in Amazon's recent streak of profitability. The division is facing tougher competition from Microsoft and Google, prompting concerns about whether the growth can continue on pace -- especially amid price wars. Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business again posted torrid growth on Thursday as corporate customers adopt the service to handle larger pieces of their computing operations. Office 365, the online version of Microsoft's widely used productivity software, reported huge gains as well, as businesses increasingly subscribe to email, word-processing and spreadsheet applications that run in Microsoft's data centers. Intel posted an increase in first-quarter profit, helped by an uptick in PC demand. CEO Brian Krzanich said selling price strength across nearly every segment of the business in the quarter "demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data." --Jay Greene and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Updated: Friday, April 28, 2017, 11:20 [IST] Previously, we got to know that Google is prepping upcoming Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 smartphones codenamed Walleye and Muskie. As per the rumors, there is a third device carrying the codename Taimen and it isn't clear if it belongs to the Pixel 2 lineup. Earlier this week, we came across rumors that Google is working on three Pixel smartphones likely to be powered by the latest octa-core Snapdragon 835 SoC. A new code spotted in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) suggests that Google could be launching the Pixel 2 smartphone earlier. One of the Google engineers, David Zeuthen, has gained access to a physical handset of the alleged Google Pixel 2 codenamed Walleye. He was able to carry out a manual test on the same. This information tips that Google could be testing the Pixel 2 prototypes with the basic code of the upcoming iteration of Android. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Early release possible It was in October 2016 that the first generation Pixel smartphones were launched. While these are hardly six months old, the new finding points that the successors are almost ready with Google. The testing process of the same has also debuted. Also, Google already released the Android O developer preview in March tipping that the Android 8.0 will be launched along with the upcoming 2017 Pixel smartphones. Eventually, there is an increased possibility for Google to announce the Pixel smartphones early this year. Also Read: Three Google Pixel phones with Snapdragon 835 SoC may launch this year Google might avoid clash Given that Samsung and Apple are all set to release their upcoming flagship models such as Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 7s, 7s Plus, and iPhone 8 in August or September, Google could have chosen to release the second generation Pixel smartphones earlier to avoid the clash. Pixel 2 to be made by HTC On the other hand, when Rick Osterloh, the senior VP for Hardware at Google was asked about the Pixel 2 release date, his reply tipped that the smartphones might be launched in October 2017. Though the original Pixel models were sold as made by Google, they were assembled by HTC. The same is expected to happen with the Pixel 2 lineup as HTC has signed a two-year manufacturing deal with Google. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

X Simon the rabbit, Corbyn’s bank holiday promise and happy times for McDonald’s Planet Business: Angela Merkel, the web’s ‘quality raters’ and United Airlines’ week about an hour ago Laura Slattery German chancellor Angela Merkel holds a 3D printed figurine of herself at the Hannover Messe trade fair. Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP         In numbers: Bank holiday bliss 4 Number of UK-wide bank holidays that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party wants to add: St David’s Day, St George’s Day, St Andrew’s Day and something called St Patrick’s Day. This would take the tally to 12, which it says is the average for G20 countries. £1 billion Estimated sum that Corbyn’s policy would cost the UK economy in “lost productivity”. Pffft. 9 Number of official public holidays in the Republic of Ireland, although no one has ever bothered to legislate for Good Friday, so really there’s 10. The last one added was the May bank holiday, first marked in 1994. Image of the week: Mini-Merkel What a week Angela Merkel has had. There was, of course, the business of having to keep a straight face and laughing at jokes as appropriate while sharing a platform with “First Daughter” Ivanka Trump. On Monday, the German chancellor also had the dubious pleasure of being gifted with a 3D printed figurine of herself by Siemens chairman Joe Kaeser, as German education and research minister Johanna Wanka looked on, at the Hannover Messe trade fair. Meanwhile, Merkel had to tell Ivanka’s father how EU trade works “11 times” last month, a senior German official has claimed. Look, even the 3D figurine has a better understanding of trade blocs than Donald. Photograph: Tobias Schwarz / AFP. The lexicon: Quality rater A “quality rater” is what Google calls members of its 10,000-strong global workforce of independent contractors who rate web pages in the name of helping Google’s search algorithm work better. So far, so anodyne. The internet, however, is a murky place. Today, in 2017, “quality raters” are busy flagging Holocaust denial pages to ensure that queries such as “did the Holocaust happen?” don’t bring users into the clutches of anti-Semites with their own fake versions of history. When they’re not doing that, this army of freelances is tasked with sifting through YouTube for hate speech of all varieties, all in the name of making Google’s artificial intelligence better at doing the same thing and ultimately persuading brands that YouTube is a “safe” place to advertise. By rights, “quality raters” should be offered counselling as part of their terms and conditions. Getting to know: Simon the Rabbit Rest in peace, Simon, allegedly the latest victim of United Airlines. The 3ft (90cm) continental giant rabbit, aged just 10 months, was travelling from London Heathrow to Chicago’s O’Hare airport when he mysteriously died, never having got to meet his new celebrity owner. Simon still had so much ahead of him: father Darius grew to 4ft 4in (1.32 metres), according to his British breeder. “Something very strange has happened and I want to know what,” Annette Edwards told the Sun. “I’ve sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before. The client who bought Simon is very famous. He’s upset.” United Airlines, fresh from having to explain why a passenger was dragged off an overbooked plane, said it was saddened by the enormous rabbit’s death and promised a “review”. The list: McDonald’s revival The golden arches have been under sustained pressure, but on Tuesday, the fast food company’s share price reached a record high ahead of supersized earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. So why is it all-smiles at the Happy Meal chain? 1. All-day breakfasts: Never underestimate the commercial potential of an afternoon hash brown. 2. Coffee: The expansion of its McCafe side-brand has new customers hooked. 3. Cheaper soft drinks: Let its recent price cuts in this area be a lesson to all. 4. Home delivery: Outside Asia, this is still an untapped market for McDonald’s, but it plans to deliver in the US, the UK, France, Germany and Canada soon. 5. Never say never again: Chief executive Steve Easterbrook says the turnaround at McDonald’s is partly thanks to the return of “lapsed customers”.       Topics: Angela Merkel Ivanka Trump Jeremy Corbyn Joe Kaeser Steve Easterbrook Eu G20 Labour Google McDonald's Siemens United Airlines YouTube Read More Martin Wolf: We must seize the opportunity for global growth Trump seeks 15% US corporate tax rate Blanchardstown: Population - 75,000, properties for rent: 3 UK ‘will not seek divide-and-rule approach’ in Brexit talks Brexit keeps British property buyers away from Spain Trump pushes for corporate tax rate reduction Irish pharma and medtech at risk from US tax cuts, says Deloitte Noonan says UK election will not derail AIB share sale UK factories upbeat on exports, but worried about inflation Timothy Kenny appointed chief financial officer at Cairn Homes  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services Mortgage lending soars by 30% at Bank of Ireland Work Digital economy: Low pay, long hours, no security Hurling Jackie Tyrrell: Tipperary’s mindset was all wrong Economy Simon the rabbit, Corbyn’s bank holiday promise and happy times for McDonald’s Sponsored ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways ‘I just love it, it’s a lovely place to work,’ says ‘Burlo’ concierge Latest Business UK house prices fall again in April as buyers face Brexit pinch 07:51 Danske Bank Ireland to deliver ‘solid returns’ after strong Q1 07:44 First quarter operating profits slide by 60% at Ulster Bank 07:35 Mortgage lending soars by 30% at Bank of Ireland 07:22 Digital economy: Low pay, long hours, no security 07:00 Most Read in Business 1 Regulator rejects claim Matheson charities’ financial services “ancillary” 2 Mortgage lending soars by 30% at Bank of Ireland 3 Tony O’Reilly’s bankruptcy proves solvency affords privacy 4 KBC to cut fixed interest mortgage rates by up to 0.35% 5 John FitzGerald: Low rate of inflation brings its own problems 6 First quarter operating profits slide by 60% at Ulster Bank 7 AIB’s problems are manageable and won’t spook investors 8 Ray Nolan of XSellco: “Brexit has got to be good for us, it’s got to be’ 9 Revolut signals banking revolution with 30,000 Irish customers 10 Trinity College confirms money lost in cybersecurity attack Never miss a story.

A Lithuanian named Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly came up with a scheme to defraud US tech companies in 2013. He convinced Google and Facebook that he was Quanta Computer, a major supplier of components to US tech companies based in Taiwan. Rimasauskas allegedly forged email addresses, invoices, and corporate stamps to trick companies into paying for computer supplies, said the US Justice Department. Over two years, Google and Facebook made transfers worth millions of dollars. By the time they realised he was a scammer, he had $100 million in his account. In South Africa, similar scams have been reported. Fraudsters pose as suppliers and tell companies their banking details have changed to try divert payments into their accounts. Others have impersonated law firms and house buyers to trick people into transferring payments into the incorrect bank accounts.

[96Boards OpenHours 25 April 2017 6.00pm PST, 26 April 2017 9.00am CST] Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the ARM® ecosystem, today announced the availability of the HiKey 960 96Boards development platform from Linaro Core member Huawei. Designed to provide access to the latest ARM mobile technology for AOSP developers, this new board is now listed on the 96Boards website and will become available through global distribution channels. While all AOSP developers will find the board useful, it is developers who want to work closer to the hardware who will gain maximum advantage from it. This will include mobile developers looking to enable support and innovative functionality with new and existing sensors, security and other peripheral hardware and software, and developers working on derivative products for markets like digital signage, point of sale (POS), robotics and others outside the traditional mobile AOSP space. “We are very pleased to be working with Linaro members ARM, Huawei, Google, Archermind and LeMaker on this product”, said George Grey, Linaro CEO. “The HiKey 960 delivers on the goal of 96Boards to provide access to the latest ARM technology to the developer community, with support for the latest Huawei mobile SoC featuring high performance ARM Cortex®-A73 cores coupled with the latest generation of ARM Mali™ GPU technology.” The new board is based around the Huawei Kirin 960 octa-core ARM big.LITTLE™ processor with four ARM Cortex-A73 and four Cortex-A53 cores with 3GB of LPDDR4 SDRAM memory, 32GB of UFS 2.1 flash storage, and the latest generation Mali-G71 MP8 graphics processor. Available now through Archermind (Alpha-Star) and LeMaker (Lenovator), the HiKey 960 96Boards development platform is on sale at US$239 and is expected to be available through local distribution in the US, EU and Japan in early May. “We are very pleased to bring our highest performance mobile SoC to the 96Boards program and to be working with Google and Linaro in the AOSP project,” said Benjamin Wang, Deputy General Manager of Huawei Wireless Terminal Chipset Business Unit, “We expect that developers will be excited to get access to the latest ARM CPU and GPU technology, as well as new features such as a PCIe M.2 card interface for additional high performance storage or wireless cards, all running using the latest AOSP builds.” Google develops Android to run on multiple architectures and the Linaro engagement is in particular aimed at collaboration with ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) partners. Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has been a key part of Linaro’s work since its founding in 2010, and Linaro’s AOSP contributions have now spanned 24 kernel versions from Linux kernel 2.6.36 in Android Honeycomb (3.0) to Linux 4.10 today. The HiKey 960 will be the second HiKey officially supported as an Android reference board and it will bring new levels of performance to Android developers. “ARM is committed to providing platform developers with access to new technologies in an effort to support ongoing innovation on ARM-based mobile platforms,” said Laurence Bryant, vice president of personal mobile compute, Business Segments Group, ARM. “The HiKey 960 platform integrates the latest big.LITTLE technology that combines the Cortex-A73, the most powerful yet power efficient mobile CPU, the Cortex-A53 for further efficiency and the latest Mali GPU, Mali-G71. Running on the latest AOSP builds, we’re enabling a range of advanced solutions to be brought to market more quickly.” Initial software support for the board is provided in the AOSP source tree based on the Android Common Kernel using the Linux 4.4 kernel release. Linaro and Huawei are also working on the Linux 4.9 based Android Common kernel and maintaining support for the Kirin 960 SoC in the mainline kernel.org tree, allowing for the availability of multiple Linux distributions for this board in the future. Information about the HiKey 960 board and running Android on it will be available here: source.android.com/source/devices.html. Linaro is providing instructions for developers here: linaro.co/hikey960-start. About Linaro Linaro is leading collaboration on open source development in the ARM ecosystem. The company has over 250 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the ARM architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, ARM power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro’s growing membership, and by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top five company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10. To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro’s work includes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online.

Support major updates for about two years and security patches for another year after that. If the Google Store continued to sell the device a year past its debut, then patches would continue on 18 months from the time the store stopped selling it. By and large, the rule has been followed, though some devices have clung on for a major update or two past their prime. If you thought for a second that Google would suddenly change things up and provide either less or more support, don’t think that anymore. The Pixel and Pixel XL, which launched in October of last year, will get guaranteed Android version updates through October 2018 and guaranteed security patches through October 2019. It hasn’t been a year since the phones’ launch, so for now, that last patch date stands, but you can now track that deadline to see if it moves on Google’s device support page.

REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo 1/2 left right FILE PHOTO: The Alphabet Inc. campus, also known as Googleplex, is shown in this aerial photo in Mountain View, California on April 6, 2016. REUTERS/Noah Berger/File Photo 2/2 By Julia Love and Rishika Sadam Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion (4.21 billion pounds), a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. "Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate," dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google's non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. "We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business," Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors' concerns about Google's dependence on search, Wang said. "We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company," he said. "That is quite an impressive achievement." On the other hand, Alphabet's "Other Bets"--separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily--continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down."

Alphabet reported a 29 percent jump in quarterly profit to $5.4 billion, while revenue jumped 22 percent compared with a year ago to $24.75 billion. “Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017,” chief financial officer Ruth Porat said. “We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet.” The Google segment delivered the overwhelming majority of revenues for the company — or $24.5 billion. The so-called “other bets,” which include smart home devices, self-driving cars and life sciences, took in $244 million in revenue but delivered an operating loss of $855 million, Alphabet said. The stronger-than-expected results helped lift Alphabet shares more than four percent in after-hours trade on Wall Street. The results did not appear to show a major impact of an ad boycott of Google’s YouTube earlier this year after revelations that programmed ads were placed alongside videos showing hateful content. Porat told a conference call that “YouTube revenues continued to grow at a significant rate driven primarily by video advertising.” Overall ad revenues for Google rose 19 percent to $21.4 billion in the quarter. Google has promised new efforts to match advertisers with appropriate content, using artificial intelligence, in response to complaints. Sundar Pichai, chief of Google, cited “fantastic momentum” for a variety of products including its Google Assistant, the smart home device that competes with Amazon’s Alexa-powered speakers. Pichai said the device is one element in a strategy focusing on artificial intelligence, or machine learning. “Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better,” he said. – A patient approach – Company co-founder and chief executive Larry Page said in a letter to shareholders Thursday he is pleased with the direction under the new corporate structure, which separates Google from its “moonshot” operations. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” he wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success.” Page added that “we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We’re not going to invest if we don’t see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good.” He said the company is benefitting from efforts on artificial intelligence developed by the Google Brain and DeepMind operations. “We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out,” he said. “Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more.” He said he and co-founder Sergey Brin “are having a good time looking for new opportunities and managing and scaling our existing efforts.” Under its new structure, Alphabet is seeking to expand beyond its role as a search engine that provides advertising linked to queries. Last year, Google took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching premium-priced, in-house designed Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess. The group also is selling its Google Assistant which aims to compete with Amazon’s Alexa-powered devices as a hub for the smart home, and has been working to become the platform for some connected cars.

Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. “It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. “Our great properties — like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play — are the ‘prime time’ for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google’s revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. Cloud Hardware, Revenue Soars Google’s non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. “We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. “We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. “That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s “Other Bets”–separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily–continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.” Reuters Publish date: April 28, 2017 10:27 am| Modified date: April 28, 2017 10:27 am Tags: Alphabet, Cloud, digital advertising, Google, Waymo Also read Alphabet’s Waymo is letting families in Arizona test its self-driving car ride service Google updates its ‘Trips’ app to help you better plan your holiday travels X Recommended For You Uber engineer Levandowski to stay away from self-driving vehicle project till issue with Waymo is resolved Everyone wants a flying car, but when will we get one?

It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service - one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. The company's earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. Cloud over YouTube But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. "There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person," says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. "They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices." Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had "thousands and thousands" of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. "We are evolving overall to a better place," Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing "extraordinary" growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings. That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose - Google's dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. Taking the gloss off Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion (roughly Rs. 44,960 crores), based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. "This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand," says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. Flight of the brands At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. Temporary hit or permanent scar? Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. "It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away," he said. "There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term." Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion (roughly Rs. 5,87,763 crores) in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

That's the annual growth rate recorded for paid ad clicks and impressions on Google's own sites and apps. Let that figure sink in for a moment. Google, a company that did close to $80 billion in ad sales last year, one that's more than a decade removed from achieving search dominance, managed to increase the number of ads it was paid for on its own properties by over 50%. The figure says a lot about how much smartphone activity continues to grow Google's addressable market, and how effective it has become at monetizing this activity. Alphabet reported Q1 revenue of $24.75 billion billion (up 22% annually) and EPS of $7.73 (up 28%), topping consensus analyst estimates of $24.22 billion and $7.38. As of the time of this article, Alphabet's Class C shares are up 4.2% to $929.00 and making new highs. They're now up 17% on the year. Paid clicks rose 44% overall, with the 53% growth on Google properties partly offset by the more modest 10% growth (still better than in recent quarters) on non-Google sites and apps. That figure is still better than the 39% and 32% growth respectively seen in Q4 and Q3 of last year after accounting for a change in how Google records paid clicks. Not surprisingly, CFO Ruth Porat said mobile search growth remains the biggest driver behind Google's paid click momentum, with YouTube and programmatic (software-automated) ad sales also playing roles. Weighing on revenue growth: Google's cost per click (average ad price) fell by 19%. That's larger than the 15% decline seen in Q4, and stems from a continuing shift towards smartphone search, YouTube and programmatic ads that carry lower prices than PC and tablet search ads. In addition, traffic acquisition payments (TAC) continue to rise due to mobile ad revenue-sharing payments to smartphone OEMs, carriers and developers: TAC was equal to 10% of Google properties ad revenue, up from 8% a year ago, and 22% of total ad revenue. On the other hand, the "Google Other" reporting segment, which covers non-ad businesses such as Pixel phone sales, Google Play transactions and cloud apps and services, once more provided a lift. Its revenue rose 49% to $3.1 billion, and is now equal to 15% of ex-TAC revenue. The "Other Bets" segment, which covers businesses such as Google Fiber, Nest, Waymo, Verily (healthcare tech) and Google's investment arms, saw revenue rise 48% to $244 million. But it also posted an $855 million operating loss (up 10%). As much as things like the Pixel and self-driving cars get more media attention, Google's bread-and-butter search ad business is still easily its biggest profit growth engine. And for all the concerns that have understandably existed about mobile users bypassing Google Search in favor of going directly to apps -- Amazon.com's (AMZN)  shopping app especially -- the business' addressable market keeps growing thanks to three trends: Smartphones are growing total search activity, e-commerce keeps taking share from offline retail and the use of mobile ads to get consumers to shop at local/offline businesses continues to grow. And Google has worked hard to exploit these trends by doing things like creating mobile-friendly expanded text ads and shopping ads, offering new local ad formats, making it possible to purchase items advertised on Google without leaving its mobile site, helping offline retailers figure out when an ad click resulted in a store visit and using machine learning to optimize ad bids based on how an ad is expected to performance. As the CPC decline shows, Google still has more work to do to improve the payoff delivered by many smartphone ads, but it's safe to say that Likewise, YouTube, which now sees over a billion hours of viewing per day (up 10 times since 2012), is seeing its opportunity grow thanks to mobile video viewing and the movement of brand and e-commerce ad dollars to online video channels. On this count, CEO Sundar Pichai insisted Google's efforts to deal with the March advertiser backlash caused by YouTube's hosting of extremist content are paying off, and talks with advertisers (said to number in the thousands) have been "very positive." Other interesting disclosures from Google's report and call: For the first time, Google provided geographic sales data for four regions. Including TAC, U.S. revenue grew 25% to $11.8 billion, EMEA (hurt by a strong dollar) grew 13% to $8.1 billion, Asia-Pac grew 29% to $3.6 billion and "Other Americas" 34% to $1.3 billion. Like Facebook (FB) , Google's ad sales still depend heavily on the U.S. and Europe. Google's app install ads, which run on Google Search, Google Play, YouTube and third-party apps, have now driven over 5 billion downloads. Facebook has historically been the leader in this space, but Google now appears to be a strong #2 player. Android added nearly 300 million users last year thanks to emerging markets growth. Google reported having 1.4 billion active Android users as of September 2015; it might be around 2 billion now. Costs and expenses rose 22% annually (even with revenue growth) to $18.2 billion, with subdued operating expense growth of 15% offset by higher TAC and hardware cost growth rates. But capital spending rose just 3% to $2.5 billion, after rising sharply in Q4. That, along with revenue growth, allowed free cash flow to rise 35% to $7.04 billion. Google had $92.4 billion in cash at the end of March. 60% of it was offshore -- actually a modest percentage compared with what many other tech giants have reported. With the stock now trading for 28 times a pre-earnings 2017 EPS consensus of $33.33, Google isn't as cheap as it used to be. At the same time, the company's execution in recent quarters, along with its ability to put fears about its mobile growth potential to rest, have arguably done much to justify some increase in the web giant's multiples.

By: Reuters | Updated: April 28, 2017 10:53 am Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. (File) Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. “It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. “Our great properties — like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play — are the ‘prime time’ for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google’s revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google’s non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. “We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. “We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. “That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s “Other Bets”–separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily–continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now First Published on: April 28, 2017 10:19 am No Comments.

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Google News Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's earnings drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement.

I like DuckDuckGo for its privacy, but folks have raised concerns about its US-based location. I’m also not happy that it doesn’t actually deliver Google search results. Instead, it serves up its own. StartPage, on the other hand, delivers actual Google search results in absolute privacy. It’s Google without tracking. They do this by submitting your query to Google stripped of identifying information. You even get a free proxy with every result. So, you can visit a third-party website without your internet service provider knowing about it. Even better, StartPage doesn’t track your searches or log your IP address. It’s such a privacy-minded search engine that it consistently meets or exceeds the requirements of EuroPriSe. Even Edward Snowden recommended it. Plus, StartPage offers many of the same tools as a normal Google search. This includes refining your results to only show images or videos. If a search engine can be sexy, this one sure is.

When Hui was invited to visit Google’s London office housing the DeepMind research group that developed AlphaGo, he was feeling confident. After all, as Hui puts it, “it is just a program.” Hui had reason to be confident. Although AI has achieved impressive feats in the last few years, Go has been a longstanding and especially daunting challenge—the “pinnacle of board games” says Demis Hassabis, cofounder and CEO of Google DeepMind and a world-class game player himself. No program had ever defeated a human professional on a full-sized board, and when Hui played that afternoon in London, he wasn’t expecting a challenge. But AlphaGo was no ordinary Go program. It was the product of innovative engineering, and the teamwork of a couple dozen scientists at DeepMind. Importantly, it also played a superhuman amount of Go, using that experience to train its deep neural networks and improve its play. By the time it faced Hui, AlphaGo had trained on 160,000 games recorded from top Go players, and then on 30 million more games it played against itself. As Hui found himself losing to AlphaGo, he knew that his world—and the world of professional Go—was about to change forever. In a film that documents a technical achievement, I saw two human stories. There is the work of the DeepMind scientists and their impressive quest to reach this AI milestone. But there is also the story of Fan Hui and others who dedicate their lives to studying this game. Cinematically, the latter story shines. How does it feel to no longer be the best? If mastering Go “requires human intuition,” what is it like to have a piece of one’s humanity challenged? Must Read Teaching Machines to Understand Us A reincarnation of one of the oldest ideas in artificial intelligence could finally make it possible to truly converse with our computers. And Facebook has a chance to make it happen first. As AI gradually changes our daily lives, we will all need to grapple with these questions. For Fan Hui, in one moment he is the European Go champion. In the next he is hopelessly overpowered by a combination of human engineering, machine learning, and massive-scale computation. When the media documents his loss for public consumption, his wife tells him “don’t look at the Internet,” lest he see criticism from his peers regarding his play. But Hui quickly recovers, in his own colorful and good-natured way. He eagerly becomes a collaborator, working with DeepMind to further evaluate and strengthen AlphaGo, in preparation for even stronger opponents. “[I] do my best to protect human intelligence,” Hui says with a smile, after helping to accomplish the opposite.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences The film crescendos to a five-game matchup between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol, one of the world’s best Go players, in Seoul, South Korea, in March 2016. At the time, the match was widely covered in the media, and the outcome won’t surprise any theatergoers. Nonetheless, the film succeeds at building suspense. The AlphaGo team is anxiously making final tweaks, trying to diagnose some rare but potentially embarrassing flaws. As a world champion, Sedol struggles with unusual pressure. After all, he is not just representing himself; he is representing humanity.

Don’t Believe It. Google’s New Chip Is a Stepping Stone to Quantum Computing Supremacy Immunotherapy Pioneer James Allison Has Unfinished Business with Cancer The film succeeds at overcoming another obstacle: making Go feel like a spectator sport even to the uninitiated. The matches are slow, and unless you are a Go expert, the action is difficult to discern. But with careful editing, the film conveys AlphaGo’s actions through Sedol’s reactions. Hours of Sedol’s penetrating thought are distilled into a series of nervous twitches, gasps, and frustrated expressions that reveal a man, at the pinnacle of his craft, facing a new kind of challenge. In the AlphaGo control room, we see a different picture. The room is brimming with emotion, but from the creators rather than the creation. There are moments of anxiety and joy as the DeepMind scientists monitor various diagnostics, trying to analyze what AlphaGo is thinking. Oblivious to it all, AlphaGo presses on, through good moves and bad. There are some added theatrics. Earlier, as the DeepMind team prepares for the flight to Seoul, AlphaGo (version 18) is loaded onto a laptop and tucked into a briefcase—as if Sedol could just open the laptop, boot up AlphaGo, and begin the match. In reality, AlphaGo requires a veritable computing arsenal, running on 1,202 CPUs and 176 GPUs for the match against Hui, and possibly more for the match against Sedol. Read Next Five Lessons from AlphaGo’s Historic Victory As Google’s computer crushed one of humanity’s best Go players, we learned a lot about the software’s inner workings, and what it means for AI. In South Korea, the public spectacle draws comparisons to the Super Bowl, a comfortable subject for Kohs’s directing, given his time at NFL Films. At the airport, the DeepMind scientists arrive like a championship sports team, swarmed by flashing cameras. In the streets of Seoul, the games are streamed live on giant billboards. There is play-by-play commentary. There are crowds of fans. After the match is clinched, there is sadness as a new reality sinks in. “I want to apologize,” Sedol says, with palpable disappointment. For the DeepMind team, victory is bittersweet. “I can’t celebrate,” says Hassabis. Sedol, Hui, and the others ultimately find joy, and an appreciation for the new and beautiful. Go has been studied for thousands of years. Now there is a chance to see it anew, through AlphaGo’s eyes. It will “show humans things we never discovered,” Sedol says. For the rest of us, AlphaGo's triumph is less personal. Most other human pursuits (literature, music, comedy, cooking, etc.) are still beyond the reach of current systems, and it may be a long wait before AI brings new meaning to these domains. The technology behind AlphaGo works best on specific tasks with very large amounts of training data. AI will need new approaches to tackle more open-ended pursuits from small amounts of experience, as people are able to do. Nevertheless, when AI took the crown in chess and Jeopardy! it didn't remove the magic for millions of players and fans. With Hui and Sedol as our guides, AlphaGo encourages us to embrace the changes still to come. Brenden Lake is a Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow at New York University.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution.

They respond within moments, but that response is always boilerplate like you mentioned. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Charles222 I usually roll with Google auto-creating events in calendar for me like they do, and the random stuff that doesn't float through my email goes to Todoist. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Charles222 Having a few Homes around the house is what pushed it for me. I'll remember some random-ass thing I need to do in the future, and I don't take my phone to bed (or have it particularly nearby generally at home) as a rule...but I do have a Home in the bedroom and just being able to talk to to Todoist to set up an event is fantastic. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. bekifft Pretty sure that one was for example, I doubt his dog's name is actually Fido. I admit it is kind of unlikely you'd get that many reminders in one notification, but it does illustrate the point that Google hasn't quite thought the system through. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v bekifft This happens to me too. Not so extreme, but it seemingly sometimes takes Google quite a while to realize I'm home for reminders. Which is strange because they bloody well know that I'm home, they spend all day burning through my battery to make sure they know where I am at all times. Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Scott Scrivens I have tried Tick-Tick actually, and I seem to remember not liking the UX. It's seems it's had a considerable makeover since then though so I'll check it out again, cheers. Jock Murray I use Business Tasks by Appgenix-software.com I don't think Google realise the importance of their Google Tasks. The ability to nest tasks and have descriptions/comments attached to each task, is critical. Keep users don't know what they're missing out on. Scott Scrivens Looks good, I'll check it out! pantagruel I use Business Calendar 2 with support for Google Tasks built in. Smarter choice if you use your calendar as well. bekifft Since we're recommending apps, this one seems the best, and uses Google Tasks as its back end. Come to think of it, I'm not sure Google Tasks even has an official front end anymore, but Google seems to have forgotten to shut it down. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.splendo Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. morrisp Well, it won't appear (or notify you) on the desktop Calendar -- but will still notify you in the Calendar app, yes? N8SLC Yes, morrisp. :) Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. F4LL0U7 If you're talking about reminders set through the Google app, you have to go into the Google app's settings and enable sound & vibration for those notifications. I think they're off by default. ellett Nope, I don't use reminders through the Google app. I do all of my calendar-related operations through Calendar. Putting appointments, reminders, notifications and alarms in different places is just plain wrong. F4LL0U7 Ha, you have a point. It might seem obvious, but you just might want to check and make sure the notification sound is enabled in Calendar also. I think that one might be off by default too. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. iCON You are talking about a company that has six different messengers... Scott Scrivens I'd say it's more about whether it's profitable, rather than whether it's possible. Sad truth. F4LL0U7 There was a recent article on AP (I forget who wrote it) about Google's messenger strategy (or lack thereof) that seemed pretty spot-on. I would bet their reminder strategy is pretty similar. bekifft That, and I don't think they've had a clear reminders strategy from the beginning, and probably still don't. With reminders tied into all these services, it's probably an engineering nightmare at this point. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Naxx ENVY ^ this , his phones on like 5% , hes like . i forgot something , let me check my list ... oh right yea charge phone . Scott Scrivens Because the battery on my Nexus 5X doesn't last the whole day. So a reminder to charge it at around 4PM is useful. I'm not always able to, but if I intend to be out of the house in the evening it's a necessity unfortunately 😩 Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different Scott Scrivens Agree with Luzandro. It's probably the best option but still not as good as the Google app input method. bekifft Yes and ironically the Google app does not yet have any app shortcuts. Add Reminder and View Reminders would be two excellent choices. TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. morrisp The stock iOS Reminders app is indeed buggy -- notifications sometimes don't go off. It's a big problem! I recently switched to using an app called MinimaList for most of my reminders. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like. Scott Scrivens You're right about this, and it does work well enough. I just wish Inbox reminder notifications wouldn't disappear after a random amount of time. Miguel Hernandez I know this may sound blasphemous to some in this community but how about Cortana? It has a widget that show upcoming reminders and easy add reminder button and is cross-device with Windows 10. Antonio Gabbiano Exactly the same thoughts that I have. The fastest way to add a reminder is via shortcut for Inbox. Hanny Yeung Google Reminder as a new separate app in 3...2...1... Btw, I use Loop for my recurring reminders. Good design & usability, plus I can track my habit performance (I saw Vitamins in your calendar and that seems to be a suitable entry for Loop). Everything else are occasional, so they're in Google, created by voice command. Agreed an app shortcut from Google app and a separation of each reminder in notifications would make life easier. Vivek Shah I completely agree with Scott. The reminder options in Google Calendar desperately needs a overhaul. Hope they're reading this. Polyterative Calendar is great but abbandoned by google.. I'm a power user and these annoyances are really bad bekifft I wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's definitely not a core product anymore. They made it to compete with Microsoft and Exchange back in the day, and it was effective at that, but that's not what they care about anymore. So actually yeah, I can see how it is kind of abandoned. _jack_ Tbh, that's why I use another app for reminders and to-dos. I hate this inconsistencies, and a dedicated service for reminders isn't a bad idea (especially when using them extensively). makapav Not to mention there is no option to make the reminder notification more aggressive: intensity, repeat, persistence. vodanium I really miss that, too! Sometimes I want a reminder to really grasp my attention to do the task at the very moment. In other cases, though, it is not an issue to miss the notification for a few minutes/hours - most of the to-do activities are like this. I've been using The Clock app for "hard" notifications, but it is far from being ideal: e.g. it can be used for reminders within one week only, no option for sophisticated recurrences (e.g. bi-weekly), etc. makapav In other words - it's a usability clusterfuck. bekifft I've started using this app specifically for recurring reminders. Not sure whether it's a good thing or bad thing that Google leaves these gaping holes to third party providers, but here check it out: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bleyl.recurrence&hl=en Rafael Reinoldes Not to mention their task management system, We can create a task list in keep, export it to docs and suddenly they were not tasks anymore, while gmail still have a half-baked task functionality that doesn't support remainders, but supports nested items!! Rafael Reinoldes Forgot about the inability to import lists from docs to keep again Rafael Reinoldes Did you said 'chrome'?!? How could anyone set a remainder from chrome? Scott Scrivens Search "add reminder" in Google. As long as you're signed into your Google account you'll get this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b7f84553cb8c9298712a98dc6a5f355c79fb13f00154d89a39eaa785046cdab9.png Rafael Reinoldes Not working here, even in an anonymous tab, probably only available in US, tested in android and desktop from Brazil. Scott Scrivens Interesting. I'm in the UK and it works for me. Maybe not everywhere though. Sorry to get your hopes up. You are signed into Google right? Rafael Reinoldes I am logged into google, mainly, because I get a lot of value by syncing stuff across different computers. Scott Scrivens That's annoying, not sure why it wouldn't work in Brazil :( Nathan Type "add reminder" in the Chrome address box. I do it all the time on my PC because it is faster than picking up my phone, but I was also experiencing problems with notifications for reminders set in Chrome not appearing on any of my devices. Now I know why. Rodrigo Chiong It's true that the reminders situation a mess. But I do see a launcher shortcut to add reminders from Inbox that work alright. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dc3b51117bfc2b134dc2fdf28b442f4389a3730166e304ee5ae2969fbe776d83.png Scott Scrivens This is true, and it does work pretty well. The only issue is that, as others have pointed out, Inbox reminder notifications seem to disappear after a little while. I like to leave my reminder notifications in the shade until I get to them. Rodrigo Chiong Well that's also true. You never know if the notification will come from Calendar, Keep, Inbox or the Google app and they all behave differently (particularly the snooze feature) KB You don't need "add reminder" in the search box, just typing "reminder" is sufficient. Dan While adding a reminder in chrome only allows times in 30 minute increments, there is a workaround for at least this part: include the specific time (and optionally the actual reminder text itself) in your 'add reminder' search: 'add reminder 7:40pm' will pre-fill the time for you (although changing the time will still only allow the 30 minute incremented time values) or just search the entire reminder: 'add reminder take out the trash at 7:40pm' or 'remind me to take out the trash at 7:40pm' hopefully this helps someone else Scott Scrivens Great find. As a way of crowdsourcing fixes this is proving very worthwhile. Chris Sanner lessee....what else about reminders bugs me - 1) if you want to dismiss a recurring notification early one dya your only option is to dismiss it *forever* 2) no "repeat x time after completion" option. this is the thing that most keeps me on other todo apps. I might not replace my furnace filter ON THE DAY it's due - but I want to be reminded again a month after I *DO* replace and dismiss it. Joe Dink AMEN! So true! It's pathetic. On such a good platform, otherwise. Chris I agree the reminder system has some shortcomings. I was frustrated recently when the assistant had all but removed entering a reminder by typing if you're in a situation where you can't use your voice. So, I wrote this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccwilcox.quickreminders Its shortcuts to create Google reminders. I depend on reminders, as well Scott Scrivens That looks really useful. Incompatible with my 5X though sadly... Chris Not compatible with the 5X? I'll look into that asap and fix that... Scott Scrivens Let me know when you do, I'll give it a whirl. Chris What country are you in? Are you in the US? Currently, I have the Play Store distribution set to US only for compatibility with Google's app service F4LL0U7 I recently got Android Wear 2.0 on my GWR, and noticed that I don't even receive reminders on there anymore! I set all my reminders through Google Now, and last night I got a monthly reminder at 9pm on my phone. Nothing at all showed up on my watch. I navigated to the Reminders app on my watch, and the recurring reminder was in the list, but it showed zero current reminders. WTF! Seems like this might be a leftover bug from AW 1.x, where I would receive reminders right on time on my watch, but they were not actionable. If I tried marking one as done, it would think for a few seconds, and then I'd get the frowning cloud icon saying I wasn't connected. But I WAS connected, damn you Google! Josh A The app shortcuts u said Google should add on the home screen can be added to the home screen by holding on the icon again. For example, look at the pic added https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae1ec39a9aa7517f5e7184c8e8332418e71499a85ea1c56450445ad292f0ba61.png Patrick O’Hara To me, the issue isn't getting reminders into the device. The issue is that there is only 1 type of reminder and it's easy to miss. There should be multiple reminder types. Silent, visual, audible, and urgent, for example. I've set lots of reminders that I never got because my volume was turned down. myssi GIVE ME REMINDER WITH DURATION!! Trip66 To find all your reminders all you have to do is say Okay Google show me my reminders and scroll the list the most recent ones are usually on top I've never had any problems finding them. Devin Quesenberry Scott, hang in there pal. You're not alone in your struggle. I've been trying to find a digital solution for my non-scheduling mind since the Trapper Keeper days. Some days I still have to carry around pen and paper, but I'm grateful for google reminders nonetheless. When Inbox came out I signed up because I liked the idea of merging my to-do list with my email (I wish Google would capitalize on this more, but it seems to me that they are starting to take the shotgun approach to development in general). However, I still find myself needing other apps like Keep and Onenote to get the job done. Reminders help me compartmentalize the many hats I have to wear between work, home, and volunteer life, so DO NOT APOLOGIZE for having reminders to do basic things like charge your phone, use the bathroom, or bathe every once in awhile. I even have reminders to check in on my mom from time to time (i.e. reminders to be a decent human being). Loved this article. Fong Yang I'm also a heavy user of reminders and I see the same problems. I hope Google fixes this soon. bekifft You're not alone, I would have written almost exactly this article if I could find the words. I've come to most of the same conclusions you have. Keep is by far the best way to handle reminders through Google, as it's the only one that lets you specify an arbitrary location at which to be reminded. The reason reminders haven't been added to Google Home yet is likely precisely because of this mess. God only knows what it looks like on the back end. Andrey Balandin You're very right in pointing out these deficiencies and I totally support that the experience is inconsistent. However, to be fair you are not using the right view in the calendar for your purposes. There is value in having one app which can show you all of the reminders created by all different methods together with other events and calendar is a good place for this, isn't it? To avoid this cluttered look which makes the calendar unusable you should just switch to schedule view. YuCMi You forget that Google's business strategy is to have clones of each of their products. Rob It's worth adding that you can only add a reminder using the Google app if you have Google Now cards activated (I don't, because I find it otherwise useless).

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Google News Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's earnings drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement.

By Steven Overly / The Washington Post The embattled leader of Uber’s self-driving car program stepped out of that role Thursday, the latest development in a trade secret dispute between two of the industry’s leading players. At stake is what many technologists consider to be the intersection of the next wave of computing, artificial intelligence and an entirely new category of transportation. Anthony Levandowski has emerged as a central figure in the legal battle between Uber and Waymo, Google’s driverless car initiative. A former Google employee, Mr. Levandowski is accused of stealing 14,000 documents that contained technology designs before leaving the company last year to start his own self-driving venture. That company, called Otto, was acquired by Uber in a matter of months. That deal brought to Uber most of the employees now working in the company’s Advanced Technologies Group that’s building self-driving cars. Waymo filed suit against Uber claiming the ride-sharing company’s technology is based, at least in part, on the stolen information. The company is also seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Uber from using the disputed technology until the case is resolved. A hearing on that injunction is scheduled for May 3 in San Francisco. Although Mr. Levandowski will remain at Uber, he won’t be overseeing a crucial autonomous-car project while the ride-hailing service is locked in a legal showdown with Waymo. Earlier this month, Judge William Alsup threatened to bar Mr. Levandowski from working on the company’s autonomous cars if he and Uber did not more fully investigate Waymo’s accusations. Mr. Levandowski will be replaced by Eric Meyhofer, according to a staff email. Mr. Meyhofer oversees development of the company’s light detection and ranging — or lidar, technology — which serves as the vehicle’s eyes on the road. Mr. Levandowski will stay with Uber and maintain his other responsibilities. In the email, he sought to distance himself from the company’s lidar development, stating that he does not currently “provide input on detailed LiDAR design choices.” “We should all be proud that our self-driving technology has been built independently, from the ground up,” Mr. Levandowski wrote in the email. Mr. Levandowski has added to the intrigue swirling around the high-profile case by invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, raising the possibility that Waymo’s civil lawsuit might trigger a criminal investigation into what happened. Attorneys for Mr. Levandowski did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the email, which was first obtained by Business Insider, but did not comment further. The Associated Press and The New York Times contributed.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UV4mtD ALSO READ Alphabet posts strong revenue growth, higher taxes hit earnings Google parent Alphabet's revenue rises 22.2 percent Alphabet quarterly revenue rises 22.2 pct Alphabet CEO touts results of corporate restructuring Alphabet quarterly profit misses estimates, shares fall By Julia Love and Rishika Sadam (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google's size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. "They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc , Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. "Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (http://bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate," dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. "Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google's non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. "We're seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business," Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors' concerns about Google's dependence on search, Wang said. "We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company," he said. "That is quite an impressive achievement." On the other hand, Alphabet's "Other Bets"--separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily--continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet's "Other Bets," climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google's performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. "With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility," Page wrote. "We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down." (Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru and Julia Love in San Francisco.

Take your FirstStep Google parent Alphabet's profit up 29 percent on strong ad sales (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. By Julia Love and Rishika Sadam (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google's size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. "They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc , Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. "Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (http://bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate," dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service.

As an assistant professor at the School of Library and Information Sciences, she knows that relieving that angst is her job. “We find students search on Google, decide the first hit is the right one, and then go on with their day,” says Moorefield-Lang. “We also have students who come in and believe if something is on the Internet it must be true. We would like them to know the difference between information that’s research-based [or not] and [between] a scholarly and popular resource.” Preparing students for college is the endeavor of most high school educators. Librarians, in particular, understand the research and critical thinking abilities a college education requires. But often many find themselves hamstrung. If the school has a librarian at all, their scarce resources of time, money, and space may be taken up with test prep requirements at the expense of things such as subscriptions to databases, which nearly every college student will need to know how to navigate. Public libraries, of course, must juggle supporting students with the rest of their constituents—and can only reach those who choose to ask for research help. College librarians, and others who work closely with college freshmen, understand that their high school colleagues are already pressed to do much with little. Yet that doesn’t mean they don’t have a wish list of what first-year students should come armed with in terms of scholarly skills. Pulling the plug on Google As the director of undergraduate programs at Yale University, New Haven, CT, Emily Horning says many incoming students are familiar with databases, but Google dependency is still fairly ­common. So Horning and her colleagues often work with students to refine keyword searches and locate details they need. Her goal is to help them find source materials they wouldn’t discover with a search engine—and have them understand that they’re expected to do this kind of in-depth work at this point in their education. “They realize that the kind of sources their professors will want to see are things they can find in the library,” she says. “Not necessarily poking around on Google.” Nonetheless, students sometimes push back at instruction on how to use databases, or how to work around a gap in the scholarly record. Eliot ­Finkelstein of the College Library at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M) says students will say they’re switching topics because they can’t find any information on their initial idea. Finkelstein, public services librarian and instruction coordinator for the university’s undergraduate library, knows this attitude reflects today’s culture, in which Google results come up in a nanosecond. But, he says, that’s the antithesis of what college, or scholarly, work is about. Instead, he wants students to understand they’re contributing to a conversation—and are expected to put forward a new, original thought. To do that? Students must invest their time and ideally their excitement. “Research is messy,” says Finkelstein. “If there’s nothing on your topic, or you’re not finding anything, maybe that’s a good thing. Then you can add a point of view that hasn’t been explored and find other sources that can help you bring that out. It’s a discovery process.” Plagiarism school Working with students who don’t know how to quote or cite other people’s materials properly is another hurdle college librarians face. Yale’s Horning sends students to reference books or online sites such as Zotero and EndNote, which can help them format their materials quickly and accurately. Still, there are students who just don’t understand that they must credit others and that failing to do so is plagiarism and not allowed in college. Kent State University, OH, actually runs a so-called plagiarism school, managed by librarians for students who have been caught plagiarizing. The librarians walk the offenders through their papers, explaining the proper method of attribution. If the students get help with the citations, they can sometimes still get a grade for that work, albeit lower than what they would have gotten had they cited appropriately in the first place. “We also have sessions to explain what plagiarism is,” says Jasmine Jefferson, a first-year experience librarian at Kent State. “But students can only come to plagiarism school once.” Freshman wish list Even as college librarians understand, and voice their recognition, that high school librarians are working with limitations, they still wish freshmen had, at least, some familiarity with writing a research paper. “Something beyond a report,” says Sherri Saines, a reference librarian at Ohio University’s Vernon Alden Library in Athens. “A writing exercise in which the student gathers information, digests it, learns something from it, and then writes about it. Our students come without that experience, which is surprising. I have talked with high school librarians, and they say, ‘I lost all that time because of testing.’ It makes me want to scream.” Allison Mackley gets that concern. That’s why the teacher-librarian and library department chair at Hershey High School, PA, runs a semesterlong class called “Ethical Research from Passion to Purpose,” with the end result an original research paper. “The class is becoming more popular because kids realize they need these skills when they start college,” she says. “One student also got an internship in Washington, DC, based on her project, the use of social media in political campaigns.” Cathy Jo Nelson wants to help her 2,400 students at Paul M. Dorman High School in Roebuck, SC, so she invests heavily in databases so the high schoolers are familiar with these online resources before they start college. Nelson estimates the school has about 30 databases available, some paid for by the state and about seven paid for by the school. “Every year the purchase order crosses [the principal’s] desk and he asks if these are necessary,” she says. “We have to justify it every year. But we have a heavy emphasis on making our students college career ready. And one way we do that is by beefing up on subscription databases to make sure [our students are] exposed to what their college environment will be as well.” IdaMae Craddock starts even younger. As the librarian at Burley Middle School (BMS) in Charlottesville, VA, Craddock gets her sixth to eighth graders started by building annotated bibliographies. The middle schoolers learn how to use citations and are taught to recognize a reliable source—and what is not. Craddock knows how important research skills are during the college years. Before working at BMS, she spent three years as the school librarian at Monticello High School, also in Charlottesville, working with AP English students on their research projects, helping them to locate and spot reliable and primary sources. “That’s especially important now at the middle school as we have a Maker Lab in the library,” says Craddock. “So whatever the students want to make, the instructions need to be from a reliable source.” Building partnerships When she was at the high school, Craddock says she partnered with a librarian at the University of Virginia who would come to the school to talk with students about college-level research. She also arranged a field trip so students could find primary sources on their own. Other colleges, among them Kent State and UW-M, say they support that back-and-forth with the high schools in their area. Yet whenever the students show up—as high schoolers or college freshmen—librarians want that first experience of exploring a college library to remain fun. If students feel criticized for not knowing how to research a paper, properly source material, or locate information they need for a project, they’re not only less likely to do well—they’re less likely to ask for help again. Getting hung up on where they are and putting added stress on their experience will only alienate students further. And that doesn’t help them—nor the college hoping to provide their education. “We take them where they are,” says Virginia Tech instruction librarian Carolyn Meier. “We move them forward and show them all the cool stuff we have and what we can do to help them. The more positive you are, the more excited you are, the happier they will be. If you approach them with, ‘This is how you can do this, and it’s easy’ rather than, ‘Why didn’t you learn this in high school?’ it [opens] a better frame of mind for them and a better frame of mind for us.” This article was published in Library Journal's May 15, 2016 issue.

Facebook accused of under-reporting Aussie revenue as new profit-shifting law kicks in Chris Keall Friday April 28, 2017 Share RELATED AUDIO: Spark boss Simon Moutter says multinational profit-shifting will get worse (June 2016) Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Facebook’s Australian operation has been accused of under-reporting its revenue for 2016, the first year of filing under a new law designed to clamp down on profit-shifting. The Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law – popularly known as the “Google Tax” – came into force on January 1 last year. It targets multinational companies that artificially avoid having a taxable presence in Australia despite having a significant presence and "permanent establishment" in the Australian market. The new law is nicknamed after Google, which often bills business in Australia (and New Zealand) to subsidiaries in lower-tax Ireland and Singapore. But if allegations aired in the Australian Financial Review today are correct, it will be Facebook attracting the first controversy under the new law. The paper says it has obtained accounts that show Facebook had revenue of $A326.9 million in the 2016 calendar year. That’s a ten-fold increase from the previous year. But unnamed ad industry experts suggested to AFR that Facebook actually booked in excess of $A550 million in Australia in 2016. In 2015, Facebook booked revenue of $A33.6 million. It paid tax of $814,187 and recorded a loss of $970,647 loss. NBR has asked Facebook for comment (the social network had no immediate comment for AFR). On this side of the Tasman, Facebook and Google have both reported revenue that seems light relative to the size of the online advertising market as reported by the Interactive Advertising Bureau or IAB (Google, for example, reported a $601,000 loss on $10.7 million revenue in New Zealand for 2015; whereas IAB figures for 2016 show the total New Zealand online ad spending for 2016 was $890 million – and of that total, 55% was spent on search, a category totally dominated by Google). Whatever happens with Facebook, it could be just the warm-up for Google, which is estimated to have earned revenue of $A2 billion to $A2.5 billion from Australia last year. Google has not filed 2016 accounts yet but, for 2015, it reported Australian revenue of $A501.8 million and profit of $A50 million. It paid $A16 million tax. Our government has broadly favoured following a slow-moving OECD multilateral “BEPS” process rather than the unilateral actions taken by the UK and Australian governments. On April 3, Revenue Minister Judith Collins hinted a tougher stance could be on the way. Ms Collins said Inland Revenue had advised her that up to $300 million or more a year in tax was being lost under current rules because of New Zealand business being booked to offshore subsidiaries, and practices like loans to parent companies at high interest rates to minimise tax paid in New Zealand. Ms Collins and Finance Minister Steven Joyce released three discussion papers containing measures against multinational profit-shifting. A consultation period has just closed. It remains to be seen if the government will follow through on any of the papers’ recommendations, if any.  Read more from Chris Keall Email Chris: ckeall@nbr.co.nz Follow @@ChrisKeall Got a question about this story?

Alphabet reported a 29 per cent jump in quarterly profit to $5.4 billion (Dh19.8 billion), while revenue jumped 22 per cent compared with a year ago to $24.75 billion. “Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017,” chief financial officer Ruth Porat said. “We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet.” The Google segment delivered the overwhelming majority of revenues for the company — or $24.5 billion. The so-called “other bets,” which include smart home devices, self-driving cars and life sciences, took in $244 million in revenue but delivered an operating loss of $855 million, Alphabet said. The stronger-than-expected results helped lift Alphabet shares more than four per cent in after-hours trade on Wall Street. The results did not appear to show a major impact of an ad boycott of Google’s YouTube earlier this year after revelations that programmed ads were placed alongside videos showing hateful content. Porat told a conference call that “YouTube revenues continued to grow at a significant rate driven primarily by video advertising.” Overall ad revenues for Google rose 19 per cent to $21.4 billion in the quarter. Google has promised new efforts to match advertisers with appropriate content, using artificial intelligence, in response to complaints. Sundar Pichai, chief of Google, cited “fantastic momentum” for a variety of products including its Google Assistant, the smart home device that competes with Amazon’s Alexa-powered speakers. Pichai said the device is one element in a strategy focusing on artificial intelligence, or machine learning. “Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better,” he said. A patient approach Company co-founder and chief executive Larry Page said in a letter to shareholders Thursday he is pleased with the direction under the new corporate structure, which separates Google from its “moonshot” operations. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” he wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success.” Page added that “we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We’re not going to invest if we don’t see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good.” He said the company is benefitting from efforts on artificial intelligence developed by the Google Brain and DeepMind operations. “We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out,” he said. “Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more.” He said he and co-founder Sergey Brin “are having a good time looking for new opportunities and managing and scaling our existing efforts.” Under its new structure, Alphabet is seeking to expand beyond its role as a search engine that provides advertising linked to queries. Last year, Google took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching premium-priced, in-house designed Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess. The group also is selling its Google Assistant which aims to compete with Amazon’s Alexa-powered devices as a hub for the smart home, and has been working to become the platform for some connected cars.

Between Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) , Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) , and iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT) , the trio of companies all gave shareholders reasons to smile. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of April 3, 2017 The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. This video was recorded on April 26, 2017. Chris Hill: It’s Wednesday, April 26th. Welcome to Market Foolery ! I’m Chris Hill, joining me in studio today from Rule Breakers and Supernova , David Kretzmann and Aaron Bush. Happy Wednesday, gents! David Kretzmann: Hey, Chris! Aaron Bush: Happy Wednesday. Hill: This is one of those days when we have three companies we’re going to talk about today. We could easily talk about ten other companies. That’s how many companies are reporting today. But, we have to choose, because we’re not doing an hour long show. Kretzmann: We could. I don’t know if anyone would listen. [laughs] Hill: Two things would happen if we did an hour long show. Long-time listeners, to your point, would just cut out, they would just be like, I’m done. Once they hit the 35 minute mark, they’d pull the plug. The other thing is, Kristine Harjes is coming in in a little bit to host Industry Focus , and we don’t want to incur the wrath of Kristine Harjes and the Industry Focus crew. Bush: She’ll boot us out. Hill: So, let’s start with signs of life — I can’t believe I’m saying this — signs of life from Twitter. Shares are up 11% this morning after a first quarter report that included, Aaron, a rise in monthly active users. The revenue fell, for those of you who actually pay attention to money. The revenue fell, but that seems to matter less than the fact that monthly active users are on the rise. Bush: Yeah, I think the 10% pop in the stock today is a little misplaced, in my opinion. I don’t really think it was that great of a quarter, to be honest with you, Chris. I think you could say it was a mixed bag. Revenue was down, margins and cash flow were up, users were up. But ultimately, I do think, when you piece it all together, the news is more bad than it is good. Hill: Wow, really? Bush: I think so. On one hand, it’s clear that Twitter is slowly making changes. They’re slow, they’re ungodly slow when it comes to handling user issues like abuse and improving the actual timeline. But they are improving their cost, free cash flow is growing, the user base is growing, daily active users was up 14% year over year, which is actually pretty great. And I do think that’s because of some of these efforts they put in place from the product perspective. That said, revenue, you can’t just ignore that. That’s huge. It’s down 8% over the last year, and this is the 11th quarter in a row of a deceleration. The first quarter that it’s down. That’s pretty bad. I think the moral of the story here is pretty simple. Twitter’s ads are currently not competitive with Facebook and Google, not even close. And it’s a huge undertaking for them to become competitive. So, you can celebrate all these other wins, but at the end of the day, this is the business. Turning the ship around is still a multi-year process, and the slower they move, the higher the odds of them getting whacked. Hill: So, the people who are on Twitter itself, but also reporting in the media, etc, who are saying, among other things that CEO Jack Dorsey has bought himself some time, this was a good quarter, let’s quiet down the drumbeat of, he needs to choose between being CEO of Twitter and being the CEO of Square . You’re saying „No”. Bush: I think this is beyond him. This is beyond what any one person can change at this point. I do think a lot of the changes that he has put into place have been positive, but revenue, you can’t overlook that. Kretzmann: Yeah, Aaron mentioned the competition from Google and Facebook. As far as digital sales go, those are definitely the big giants in the room. But then, as Twitter is doubling down on its live video strategy, they’re starting to compete more with Snap , which has a very engaged user base. The growth there has slowed a little bit, it’ll be interesting to see what Snap’s metrics look like, and how those compare to Twitter, as far as ad engagement and user growth. But, yeah, it’s not a good combination when you have users going up, but ad revenue going down. And Twitter said they expect that disconnect to continue for the rest of the year. This probably won’t be the last quarter that revenue goes down. In the meantime, their pace of stock-based compensation has receded a little bit, but their diluted share count increased over 1% just from the last quarter. So, in the process, as revenue has completely decelerated and now is declining, their share count has climbed up. So I went back and looked, if Twitter wanted to bring its share count back to the same level it was in 2014, a few months after it went public, they would have to spend $1.9 billion just to get back to that break even level with the share count. What that shows is, the bar that they have to cross at some point to reward shareholders is perpetually getting higher as they continue to dilute shareholders. So, that’s not a good trend to have when your revenue is dropping. Hill: And share-based compensation, that’s one of those things that, if you’re the average investor, it’s understandable if your eyes gloss over, and it’s easy to dismiss it and focus on the more headline-oriented things like revenue and monthly active users. But when we talk about some of these tech companies potentially putting themselves up for sale, you need to recognize that share based compensation is a huge factor in that, the fact that they’re going out and hiring people and convincing them to stay on board and not jump ship, a lot of that has to do with, „Look, we’re going to give you more shares.” Go back and look at LinkedIn being acquired by Microsoft . As much as anything, it was the share-based compensation within LinkedIn that made the leaders of that company go, „We have to figure something out quick.” Kretzmann: Yeah, because that’s one of the main currencies they have for paying their employees. And competition between employers in Silicon Valley is not going to disappear. I think that’s a dangerous thing for Twitter shareholders and something to watch. At first glance, on the balance sheet, it does look pretty strong. We have net cash of $2.2 billion, as Aaron mentioned, you have free cash flow, which is going up, but stock based compensation is still a huge component for that positive cash flow production. So, the balance sheet, to me, is not as strong as it looks on the surface, because $1.9 billion just to break even with your share count two years ago, that takes up most of their net cash today. The investments that they’ve been making up to this point are not paying off. At some point, that trend has to reverse for shareholders to be rewarded. Bush: One other thing that David and I were talking about earlier today is how slow they move, and what that really means when you look long term. I think it’s easy to look at these incremental changes and think about where things should go. But the pace that they move, these larger tech companies like Facebook and Google, they could do it at the snap of a finger, what these guys take six months to do. Hill: I was going to ask you about that. It’s, in some ways, an unfair question because unless you’re spying on headquarters at Twitter, there’s no way for you to have the information to answer this question, but I’m going to ask it anyway. Why do you think that is? I’ve seen you write about this, I’ve seen other people touch on it. The popular image that we have of Silicon Valley is, among other things, it’s a fast culture, it’s a nimble culture. The way things move at Twitter, they might as well be the U.S. Department of whatever. When you think of bureaucracy, you think of Washington D.C. When you think of fast and nimble and cutting-edge, you think of Silicon Valley. Twitter’s lack of speed is really astonishing. Bush: I do think I know one big reason behind it. I think a lot of it stems from the very early days of the company. They never had to struggle to reach product/market fit. So, never in their journey to figure out how to improve what they’re doing, they never had an issue. They just threw something out there and it worked. So then, they just kept on capitalizing on what worked, but never really changed the product itself. Now that they’re up competing against these companies that have been changing their platform at pretty innovative speeds for years now, they’re finding that gap so much larger that it’s just, in comparison, it takes so much more time to get out of. Kretzmann: Yeah, it seems like Twitter just doesn’t have near the focus on the actual product. What is their platform, fundamentally, compared to Snap or Facebook, where you have leaders that are so product-driven, and it drives everything they do. From there, you find the business model that fits. But with Twitter, it seems like they’re very scattered trying to figure out the direction of the company and what their actual product is. Hill: All right, let’s move on to Chipotle. First quarter profits came in higher than expected. Same store sales were up 18%. I realize that is off of, go back a year in time, off a terrible quarter a year ago. Still, it’s nice to see that it’s up 18%. Stock up a little bit, not amazing, although it has risen about 30% in the last six months. So, I don’t know, maybe we shouldn’t expect too much of a pop off of this. Kretzmann: Yeah, I think the key for investors is, the metrics are moving in the right direction. I think you can safely say the turnaround has begun. As long as they can keep moving at this pace, I think good things are ahead for shareholders. But, it will still take time. It’ll probably be at least a year and a half, I think, before we get back to those pre-crisis levels, as far as metrics go. But, yeah, same-store sales up about 18%, their restaurant level operating margins are trending up. This quarter was almost at 18%, but that’s still quite a bit lower than the 28% restaurant level operating margin we saw right before the crisis hit in 2015. All those metrics like restaurant sales, sales as a whole across the company, margins, they’re moving in the right direction, it’s a definitive turnaround from where the company has been going for the past year and a half but still some work to do to get back to those pre-crisis levels. Bush: Yeah, when I was reading through the call, and what they’ve been doing to move back to the levels that they were, I think I was pretty impressed with what they were doing. If you look, for example, at the online sales, that increased 54% over the past year. I know that’s something in the past we’ve talked about. Chipotle is not very good at that compared to others. So, it seems like they’re moving in the right direction. Still have room to improve. They’re revamping their restaurant tour program, which also was a pain point. Hill: Is this the management program? Bush: Yes, this was their management program. Chipotle has always promoted internally. But, if you grow too fast and promote too quickly, that can lead to problems, especially if you incentivize poorly. So, they’ve been doing a lot of work around figuring out what metrics are best to incentivize their managers and field team leaders. It looks like that is improving. Just, how they’re interacting with consumers and turnover of their leaders. That’s good. They also just closed, this quarter, 15 ShopHouse locations. So, they’re moving past that — Kretzmann: Still sad about that, though. Bush: Yeah, it’s unfortunate for those of us, in the past, who were optimistic at some point. But it’s good that they are diverting those resources, now, to higher-impact endeavors. Hill: I’m a Chipotle shareholder. I’m glad they decided to pull the plug on ShopHouse, because I got tired of wondering when they were going to roll it out. The first couple of years, what you heard was a lot of, „They’re taking their time, they’re not going to rush it.” But at some point, you move so slowly that it’s natural to ask the question, „What is wrong with this concept?” Either it’s ready to be rolled out or it’s not. The fact that they said, „We’re packing it in on that, we’re going to focus on the main brand locations and go from there,” I’m glad. Kretzmann: Yeah, and on top of everything else Chipotle was dealing with for the past year, I think trying to work out issues at ShopHouse, it was just becoming a distraction. To me, that really was the theme of this quarter, it was very clear that Chipotle is refocusing. And I think part of that is boosted by Steve Ells taking over the sole leadership role as CEO. Monty Moran, who was co-CEO for a while, retired late last year. So I think you’re seeing that focus from Steve Ells. And in the call, he mentioned revamping that restaurant tour program, as Aaron mentioned. But the focus of that is a „relentless focus on customer experience.” So, sort of a Jeff Bezos-esque comment there, really trying to figure out what the priority is there for their management program. And they mentioned that they now have the lowest turnover with general managers in more than eight years. Hill: That’s great. Kretzmann: Yeah. A lot of things moving in the right direction. I think you’re seeing, internally, a refocus on prioritizing the guest experience. As they get traffic into the stores, their throughput should really be able to increase with digital orders, because they’re starting to launch kitchens in the back of the restaurants specifically for digital. That should theoretically take people out of that front line, more people can go through that front line. The restaurant, in other words, will be able to pump out more burritos, more orders. If they can get that traffic back to pre-crisis levels and hopefully beyond that, these stores could be much more profitable than they were a few years ago, and they were incredibly profitable then. Hill: Yeah. And that is, in some ways, the promise of this investment, if you’re a shareholder or a potential shareholder. Because the headlines have been so bad, and rightly so, for the last couple years. But you go back to 2013 and 2014, and they were putting up these type of same-store sales numbers, not off of a low base, off of a pretty high base. So, when they would come in with double-digit comp increases, that’s just breathtaking. So, the idea that they’re looking at what Panera has been doing and saying, „How can we do that? How can we up the people walking in and picking up their food and walking out? If we can get our throughput even higher, that’s great.” Bush: I think the biggest news out of all of this is they’re going to start testing two new desserts. Hill: [laughs] Is that the big news? What are the desserts they’re testing? Bush: They only announced one of them. It’s called buñuelos. It’s these fried tortilla strips with honey, cinnamon, and sugar. So, super healthy. Kretzmann: Fits right with their healthy ingredients theme. Hill: I hear that honey is supposed to be healthy, I’ve heard that from time to time. Kretzmann: Cinnamon, I think. Hill: Cinnamon is a spice. Kretzmann: Sugar … Bush: Just ignore that it’s fried. Hill: You know, it’s dessert, it’s not supposed to be healthy if it’s dessert. iRobot shares hitting an all-time high today after first quarter profit more than doubled expectations. Aaron, this is not a beat by a penny type situation, they crushed it. They also raised their guidance for the whole fiscal year. Holy cow. Bush: Roombas are taking over the world. That’s all you can really say. Yeah, they crushed expectations. I think what we’re seeing right now is they’re witnessing an inflection in demand of their Roombas, which is very impressive. Believe it or not, the Roomba last year was the most sold vacuum cleaner in the U.S., in terms of dollars spent. Yeah, wow. To me, that almost feels like the rise of the Roomba occurred somewhat stealthily. Looking at the product compared to past iterations, you really do see the improvements that have been coming through. They work better, they have more connected features, which will play a role more so as the connected homes inevitably start popping up more and more. The Roomba itself, obviously, is killing it. But, beyond the Roomba, there are other products and moves the company has made that also excites investors. The Braava, for one, that’s iRobot’s hardwood cleaner, right now, that’s still a tiny fragment of revenue, but it’s selling well. It also has these wipe consumables that consumers need to buy, so it adds a form of recurring revenue for the company, too, which is always good to see. iRobot just bought back its Asian distributors, which gives it more control in how it sells in that continent. That’s actually a pretty huge deal. I think later this year, we should expect Japan’s growth to accelerate. We’ll see them significantly ramp up business in China. That should be a huge deal. The Braava in particular could sell particularly well because hardwood floors are more of a norm over there. So, really giving that second product they have a huge boost. Then, lastly, the innovation machine that they have just keeps on running. They’re just as much as software company at this point as a vacuum cleaning robot company. So, new robots that perform new tasks, like lawn mowing, whatever else they have in store, should be expected. As time rolls on, these robots are going to do their jobs better and better. I think investors should expect more beats going forward. This is impressive. Hill: I was on their website and saw they also have a robot pool cleaner. I don’t have a pool, but I thought, I would 100% buy one. There are some people who actually enjoy mowing their lawn. I’m not one of them, but there are some people who are like, „It’s relaxing, I’m outside in nature,” that kind of thing. I can’t imagine anyone owning a pool and saying, „Oh, I’m looking forward to a day of Zen and relaxation of cleaning my pool.” No. Buy that thing, set it loose on the bottom of your pool, and you’re done. Kretzmann: I think our digital age has made people lazy enough that iRobot is hitting the inflection point, finally, where people just want to automate everything they can. Hill: Is 100% of their business just consumer? Do they have any sort of business-to-business relationship where they’re going to a hotel chain or something like that and selling them en masse? Kretzmann: I think now that they’re entirely a consumer goods, consumer-facing company. Last year they divested a defense or security division. I think they’re primarily selling to the U.S. military at that point. I think that makes sense, because the consumer market is sizable. In the U.S. alone, robot vacuum cleaners are about 20% of the total vacuum market. Just that robot vacuum cleaner portion, which is growing, is about $6 billion or so. So, there’s a sizable market there. And iRobot really is the dominant brand in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. So, I think doubling down and really focusing on that consumer market makes sense for them. Since they divested that security division last year, the stock has done really well. I don’t follow this closely enough I know if those two are completely related, or one caused the other. But to me, it makes sense for them to focus on that consumer market, because I think that’s where the majority of the growth is. Hill: Aaron, the stock is up about 15% today. We love it when a stock hits an all time high. But I have to ask, how expensive is this stock? When you look at it, do you think, „OK, this is great for shareholders, but right now, today, this is kind of a pricey stock?” Bush: It is a pretty pricey stock. I think it’s definitely earned it. Just seeing, today, the stock go up 15%, I think if this company continues to execute the way it has, and if this inflection point is real, then I don’t think it is as pricey as it may seem to a lot of investors. Kretzmann: Yeah, it’s still just a $2 billion company. I could see that bumping up, especially if they could maintain that brand leadership position, which they seem to have carved out pretty nicely. Hill: Before we get out of here, I should mention that Rule Breakers , the service started by David Gardner that both David and Aaron work on, the new issue of Rule Breakers  comes out today with two new stock recommendations from David Gardner and the team.

Photo / 123RF YouTube's inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavoury videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child. It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service - one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. Car giants Holden and Kia were among a long list of companies that pulled their ads from the site, after unwittingly appearing alongside a video containing misogynistic abuse of Australian journalist Ita Buttrose. Alphabet's earnings rose 29 per cent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 per cent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 per cent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. CLOUD OVER YOUTUBE But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. "There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person," said Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. "They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices." Continued below.

"YouTube continues to experience extraordinary growth and opportunities," he said. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertising, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings. That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose - Google's dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than one billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. TAKING THE GLOSS OFF Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 per cent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. "This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand," said Harry Kargman, chief executive of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand. Harry Kargman, chief executive of Kargo At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told the Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. TEMPORARY HIT OR PERMANENT SCAR? Even if advertisers return, Mr Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. "It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away," he said. "There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term." Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mr Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appal viewers and advertisers alike. - news.com.au Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Chrome to warn when you watch insecure smut Google's ongoing HTTP exposé comes to Incognito Mode and forms 28 Apr 2017 at 03:06, Simon Sharwood Google's efforts to make unsecured HTTP connections untenable will step up in October, when its Chrome browser starts to warn users that more web sites are insecure. October will see the advent of Chrome version 62, an update that will see the browser warn users that HTTP-only pages are insecure if they ask for any data entry. That release will also mark all HTTP pages as insecure when users are in Chrome's pr0n-viewing mode Incognito Mode, in which the browser does not record users' site visits or downloads. Google feels that users of Incognito Mode already have a high expectation of privacy, so helping them out with some extra security advice will be appreciated. Chrome started to warn users that sites offer only HTTP, rather than the encrypted HTTPS, as of version 56. The company says that since it started to do so, “there has been a 23% reduction in the fraction of navigations to HTTP pages with password or credit card forms on desktop, and we’re ready to take the next steps.” On some future day that Google is yet to decide and/or disclose, Chrome will mark all HTTP pages as insecure. ® Bootnote: Chrome also looks for uploads of what it thinks might be credit card numbers and blocks pages if it thinks sensitive data is about to leak. That feature's been giving some Reg operatives grief as we worked on stories like our appreciation of the Boeing 737's 50th birthday that included lots of numbers. Embedding Tweets in a story also sets off the blocker.

The tech-heavy index already pushed to a new record on Thursday of 6,048.94, a rise of 0.39%, thanks to strong results from PayPal and Comcast. But after-the-bell figures from the industry’s giants looked set to take it even higher when trading resumes on Friday. With shares already buoyant on the hopes of huge corporate tax cuts by the Trump administration, the impressive earnings helped Wall Street brush aside any concerns about a possible US government shutdown amid continued congressional wrangling.

Like its arch-rival Facebook, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99% of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, saw its shares rise to their highest ever level after it said net income rose 41% in the first quarter of the year. Retail and cloud-computing sales led the way, boosted by fees from its Prime shopping club and media streaming services, along with growing advertising revenue.

His wealth is now estimated at $79bn, making him the world’s third richest person ahead of Warren Buffett on $74bn, according to Bloomberg. Bezos is $8.3bn behind Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder who is in top spot with a fortune put at $87.3bn. PayPal jumped $2.74, or 6.2 percent, to $47.15 after reporting stronger revenue and earnings than Wall Street had forecast while Comcast was boosted by stronger revenue at theme parks it acquired as part of its NBCUniversal purchase. Microsoft profits disappointed investors as sales of its Surface tablets and laptops slumped and earnings came in lower than expected. But income was still a healthy 28% up in the first three months of the year. Intel, the chipmaker, saw profits rise by 45% to $2.9bn.

Levandowski is a key player in a lawsuit filed by his former employer, Google, that claims he stole tech that Uber is incorporating into its cars. This isn't a minor legal proceeding. It could prove to be fatal for the ride-sharing startup. Photo: Getty Business Insider was the first to report the news of Levandowski's demotion based on an internal email that Uber confirmed is authentic. In the email, Levandowski explains that he will no longer be involved in the unit of Uber's Advanced Technologies Group that develops the LiDAR system that is crucial for self-driving cars. "I want to let you know that Travis and I have decided that I will be recused from all LiDAR-related work and management at Uber, through the remainder of the Waymo litigation," he told his colleagues. "Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic." Eric Meyhofer, a co-founder of Carnegie Robotics before he joined Uber, will be taking over as the head of the Advanced Technologies Group. One specific line in the email really stands out: "As you know, I currently don't provide input on detailed LiDAR design choices." So far, Levandowski and Uber have tried to downplay his involvement with the LiDAR unit. A casual mention that he isn't really part of the day-to-day anyway raises suspicion that the email was leaked intentionally. The decision to move Levandowski out of the area of development that's being litigated comes just a week before a San Francisco court is scheduled to rule on a preliminary injunction filed by Google. If the court rules in Google's favour, Uber could be barred from further development of the disputed technology until the lawsuit is resolved. Technically, it's not Google that's suing Uber — that's just the easiest way of saying it. Google's newly created parent company Alphabet Inc. is suing Uber over technology designs it claims Levandowski stole from its self-driving car company, Waymo. Levandowski was previously working for Waymo before he decided to start his own self-driving car company, Otto. The suit alleges that before he left, Levandowski illegally copied 14,000 files from Waymo's servers. Otto was only an independent company for about eight months before Uber bought it. Alphabet claims that Uber's new LiDAR designs are based on its engineers' proprietary work. How do they know that? According to a blog post by the Waymo team: Waymo was recently — and apparently inadvertently — copied on an email from one of its LiDAR component vendors. The email attached machine drawings of what purports to be an Uber LiDAR circuit board. This circuit board bears a striking resemblance to Waymo's own highly confidential and proprietary design and reflects Waymo trade secrets. As this email shows, Otto and Uber are currently building and deploying (or intending to deploy) LiDAR systems (or system components) using Waymo's trade secret designs. This email also shows that Otto and Uber's LiDAR systems infringe multiple LiDAR technology patents awarded to Waymo. Damn. That could be a multi-billion dollar CC screw up. Uber Is Trying To Keep Its Court Battle With Google Out Of The Public Eye Last month Google filed a lawsuit against Uber alleging that the ridesharing company colluded with a former Google engineer to steal trade secrets and proprietary designs from the Waymo self-driving car unit. Yesterday, Uber's lawyers filed a motion to move the case into the dark hole of arbitration. Read more Another intriguing detail in the case is that Levandowski isn't named in Alphabet's suit. That may be because his contract with Waymo stipulated that any future litigation would be handled through arbitration. Uber desperately wants to take this embarrassing case into arbitration, but Alphabet doesn't. Today, Uber's lawyers begged the court, once again, to move the case into arbitration. Uber's attorney, Hamish Hume, told the court: They are clearly trying to game this. The agreement says 'any dispute' about the relationship goes to arbitration. If Levandowski had a problem [with Google], it would be arbitrated. They want to come to court against Uber. But Uber hired Mr. Levandowski and hired the companies he created. Waymo's lawyer, Charles Verhoeven, icily responded, "We're suing a third-party competitor [Uber], who we didn't have any agreement with." It's unknown when the judge will make a decision on arbitration but the ruling regarding the preliminary injunction is scheduled for May 3. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has called self-driving cars an existential issue for the company, so you can rest assured that this lawsuit is one of the most important things going on in his world right now. Raj Rajkumar, professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, tells The Verge, "If Waymo prevails after a long suit and a sequence of appeals, the nature of the compensation and fines could be staggering." And it's not just what Uber might have to pay out. According to Rajkumar, if the company is found guilty, "I don't see how Uber can attract additional large institutional investors." When you're bleeding money the way Uber is, that could be a death sentence.

Samsung Galaxy S8: The Gizmodo Review Mario Aguilar 27 Apr 2017 1:00 PM With the exploding Note7 battery fiasco, Samsung inadvertently did something that's increasingly difficult these days. It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting, in fact. Besides the intrigue of the mournful saga of Note7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn't just another smartphone -- this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void -- yikes!

Using multi-user media controls on Google Home: How it works Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:09am PDTApr 27, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 21 Share on Facebook 34 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Google Home News Tips & Tutorials Article Contents 1 Playing music 2 Playing YouTube videos on Chromecast 3 Playing movies and TV shows on Chromecast 4 Playing media on linked speakers and televisions 5 Guests and unlinked users in your house Now that Google has enabled multi-user support for Google Home, what can you do with your media? After a little research and a chat with Google Home support, I have the answer to that question. Keep in mind, this is the situation as of today. As we always do, we hope for these features to be fine-tuned and expanded. This article assumes each user has already linked up to the Google Homes in their household. This is an easy process that the Google Home app will walk you through for each multi-user equipped device. Playing music Google will let each user have their own default music provider. No more sharing your Google Play Music. Tapping the “Feeling Lucky?” card will no longer subject you to periodic blasts of your housemate’s heavy metal music mixed in with your preferred history of listening to R&B tracks. With this new feature, your Home will use your preferred service when you make a music request. You will still be able to use other linked services, including those attached to other users' accounts, by simply adding the name of the service to your request. Each user can select their default music provider. Let's go through some examples. Let me introduce you to Carolina and Eric, roommates living in a condo with three Google Homes. Carolina's default music service is Google Play Music and Eric's is Spotify. Each have their own premium accounts. Here are some sample requests and what would result from them. Request Result Carolina requests a playlist without specifying a service Home plays the playlist using her Google Play Music account Carolina requests a playlist and ends it with "on Spotify" Home plays the playlist using Eric's Spotify account Eric requests a playlist without specifying a service Home plays the playlist using his Spotify account Eric requests a playlist and ends it with "on Google Play Music" Home plays the playlist using Carolina's Google Play Music account As you can see, one of the great benefits here is that both users have access to the other's premium account. Carolina and Eric can play each other's playlists if they know the playlist's name. Service generated playlists are also available to both. In addition to these services, you can also link Pandora (free or premium) and YouTube Music to users' accounts. During my testing, I discovered an interesting flaw (or feature?) that Google was unaware of. I found out that, using my example users, if Eric is playing a track on Carolina's Google Play Music and tells Home that he likes it, it will be added to Carolina's "Thumbs Up" list. It works the same for Spotify. If Carolina says she likes a song on Eric's Spotify account, it's marked as liked on Eric's account. Both of these actions will affect the associated playlist and influence auto playlists. A representative at Google Support told me they were sharing this issue I encountered with their developers. At the time of this writing, the flaw still exists - so be nice to the other users in your household or find your "Thumbs Up" playlist full of hated tracks. Eric's heavy metal taste infiltrates Carolina's preference for pop hits. Playing YouTube videos on Chromecast When it comes to video, the situation is similar to music but the amount of voice control is limited. Making requests to play videos from YouTube with no further specification will play media based on the individual's YouTube account. Each individual's watch history will be updated accordingly. There is no crossover. Furthermore, you can't like or dislike videos through the Home, so that mix of tastes you see with music won't happen. Playing movies and TV shows on Chromecast Currently, the only premium movie and TV service supported is Netflix. Your Home will play from your linked Netflix service or, if you didn't link one, it will play from the Netflix account of another linked user. In other words, Netflix is shared across all users. You can't like or dislike Netflix media from the Home. Simple. Playing media on linked speakers and televisions Here is where it the doors are wide open. All users' speakers, TVs, and speaker groups are shared across all users. By trailing your request with a specific device or named group, the media will be directed there. If Carolina has defined a speaker group named "Chill Zone" that includes her Chromecast audio connected to her stereo receiver and the Home in her bathroom, any user can send media to that group. That sounds like a great way for Eric to wake her up at 5:00am just for fun. Guests and unlinked users in your house If an unlinked user, such as a visitor, makes a media request, the Google Home will use the service associated with the first person who linked their voice to that Google Home. The media services connected by this person become the default services. If a request is made using a service that the first user has not set up, the service set up by another user will be used. Carolina was the first to link her voice on each Google Home. She doesn't have a Netflix account but Eric has linked his Netflix account in the Google Home app. If a request to play music is made without specifying a service, it will play from Carolina's Play Music account. If a request to play a movie on Netflix is made, it will use Eric's Netflix account. The Google Home app has a separate process for linking your voice. Here is where it seems Google has dropped the ball (again?). There is no way to identify who the first linked voice belongs to using the Home app. Google's help page literally tells you to poll all the users in your house to determine who linked their voice first: This user is likely the person who set up Google Home, but may not be if that person hasn't linked their voice. There is no way to tell who first linked their Google Account and voice from within the Google Home app. You must ask all linked users when they linked their Google Account and voice to be sure who is the first person. Here's how to manage linked users. So, if you are adding Homes to your household over time, you'll have to call a meeting and do an investigation if you happen to have forgotten this important fact. Alternatively, you can reset your Homes and systematically set them up again. Once you have everything set up, the media sharing is a nice feature that moves Google Home another step forward. Just don't ask it to remind you to buy milk. It's still learning. Source: Google Tags google home Google Music netflix spotify youtube subscribe ...

Google can tell who's talking to them. morteum So what if two users each have their own Spotify premium account and each want to use their own account? Is that possible or do they have to use different services like you gave in your example? David Ruddock It should work fine. It recognizes your voice and would use your account. snowglyder I'm guessing the same for Google Music. We have a Family Shared Plan, but currently when my wife or kids are at home and tell Google Home to play something, it stops playing for me at work because it's limited to one device at a time. It'd be awesome if my wife asked Google Home to play a song, it would use her Google Music account. Paul Quinn I'm betting that this is all tied up in licensing agreements for the music and how it is allowed to be played. bekifft This particular scenario actually sounds like a bug since it's inconsistent with the behavior the rest of the time, defaulting to the most premium service available. That or the multi user isn't set up yet. Aaron Berlin What if an unrecognized third person gives a command? Which account does it use and can that be changed? David Ruddock This is addressed in the unlinked user section. Paul Quinn If you mean media requests, that's covered in the last section of the article. Aaron Berlin That's what I get for trying to multi-task! Itchy_Robot Can I ask it to play individual songs or albums through Google Music yet... or does it still only play pre-made Playlists? Paul Quinn Sure you can. That's been possible all along. Only tracks and albums in Google's catalog though. rslh I uploaded all my songs (not on Play Music catalog) and grouped them in separate Playlists, and GH is able to play my songs from these different playlists! It's really sweet! Paul Quinn Yes. Although one snag is you can't call up individual tracks or albums from your personal library if they aren't in Google's catalog. You have to put them in a playlist to get to them like you did. Google is aware of this but no word in when. mesername So, what if I have a premium Google Play Music account and my roommate has a regular Google Play Music account? If she gives a command to play some song, can it default to my more expansive same service? David Ruddock This is a good question. Paul Quinn I did not test this scenario but based on all the testing I did, i think it would opt into your premium account. I would have to test it later. I'm not sure if you can call on someone's service by name. If you don't say something like, "... On Eric's Google Play Music account," it's going to go for the premium account of the first linked voice. There are a lot of possible scenarios. I couldn't test them all. mesername Understood. I agree, there are lots of ways Google could try to gracefully handle this. If her account doesn't have that song, it could look to another account that does, or it could just always default to the "most premium" version of the service. Like you said, it could also respond based on naming the user's account. Nobody said this was going to be easy...(stop reading here to avoid snarky comment)...except maybe Trump. I bet he would say, "I've got the best, the greatest voice actions...I know the most successful voices, and they'll always be clear, so clear, you won't believe how clear their voices are." Sorry, couldn't resist. Paul Quinn I just tried to test it but one of my Homes contains the name of the other person in my house. When I asked it to play his Google Play Music account, it interpreted it to mean playing Google Play Music on the Google Home with his name, not his account. There are just SO MANY permutations here. I didn't mention it my article but Google was not even aware of that thumbs up issue until I brought it to them. They can't even keep up with all the angles. I get it though. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm still waiting for Google to let us use Home to control media on Android TV. At the very least, give us the ability to play, pause, seek, stop, and control the volume of media of whatever is currently playing. Anything to reduce my reliance on that God-forsaken Shield TV remote, which I can never find in the dark half the time, is a blessing. youareme7 haha no joke, i lose it on the wood table right next to me, then of course i touch the volume bar and it starts blasting, mostly stick with the fire stick remote tho that doesn't do volume Cory S I'd like to be able to setup a default device for actions that require a display. Unless I specify otherwise play youtube videos and photos on TV X, don't just fail the command. pfmiller I think they should have a default playback device for each Home device. That way depending on which Home receives the request the video can play on the nearest TV. Paul Quinn That's an excellent idea. I have done a little testing in this area. It will not play to a chromecast unless I specify which one. It will ask me to be more specific and it's sitting about 3 feet from the TV I want it to pay on. HEY GOOGLE - READ THIS SUGGESTION! bekifft That is ridiculous it can't do that, but it can do Chromecasts. Voice control of video is one of the very few things I really like about this thing, that only it can do. Lars Jeppesen Has anyone managed to get multi user control working outside the States? I bought 3 GH, I'm located in Denmark, using US english as language on the GH.. but the multi-voice settings don't appear in the Home application... Would a VPN connection with my phone suffice, or do I have to fake my location as well? Wonder why Google has restricted this feature to US only.. so weird.. Cory S How accurate is it at correctly identifying users? My pixel would fail "okay Google" all the time for voice unlock because it couldn't match my voice. Paul Quinn That is a highly variable issue that depends on the amount of difference between voices in the household. I'm sure it works great between a male and female or an adult and child. Mine has two male voices linked and it has stated it can't identify which one it is a couple of times. However, the majority of the time, it is successful. I don't use voice unlock because I don't think it's secure enough. In your case though, I don't know why it's not working.

Google's parent company Alphabet's net income rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion in the first quarter, from $4.21 billion in the same period last year. Revenue increased 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion, from $20.26 billion. Google's net income jumped 21.8 percent to $7.6 billion, from $6.24 billion; while revenue rose 21.9 percent to $24.5 billion, from $20.1 billion, during the same period. Google's ad revenue increased 18.9 percent to $21.4 billion, from $18 billion. After strong financial results, Alphabet's stock price climbed 5.1 percent to $937 a share in after-hours trading. Microsoft also saw its net income rise $27.6 percent to $4.8 billion in the January-March period this year, from $3.76 billion a year ago. Its revenue climbed 11 percent to $22.09 billion, from $20.53 billion, during that period. The results, however, missed expectations and the firm's shares fell 2.4 percent to $66.60 after the final bell. Microchip giant Intel's net income rose 50 percent to $3 billion in the first three months of the year, from $2 billion a year ago. Revenue increased 8 percent to $14.8 billion, from $13.7 billion, during the period. Intel's results also missed expectations, and its shares declined 4.4 percent to $35.83 during after hours. E-commerce giant Amazon saw its net income rise 41.1 percent to 724 million in the first quarter, from 513 million last year. Revenue rose 22.7 percent to $35.7 billion, from $29.1 billion, year-over-year. Amazon's stock price climbed to $961.44 per share with a 4.7 percent gain after the stock market closed.

Fake news is shaping up to be a serious threat to democracy, as you can't be guided by the will of the people when they're misinformed. At least that's the way it's supposed to work, although in practice modern democracies tend to be oligarchies in disguise with the powerful few lying to the masses who place more stock in feelpinions than facts anyway. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Neither side of politics can claim the moral high ground when it comes to bending the truth. Photo: Alex Elllinghausen It's not like propaganda and the abuse of power are anything new, but fake news is complicated by the fact it has been twisted back upon itself. Fake news has actually become the victim of fake news, to the point where the term is now often evoked to describe any supposed fact witth which someone doesn't agree. The classic definition of fake news comes from the 2016 US presidential campaign, referring to websites in Eastern Europe set up to fabricate sensational stories about US politicians simply as click-bait to bring in traffic and make money from advertising. The pro-Trump slant in these fake news campaigns reeked of Russian interference, as part of its increasingly sophisticated international propaganda efforts, but you could also argue that targeting angry, disenfranchised Trump supporters made good economic sense as they would be most willing to believe lies about the opposition. Fake news has become a powerful underhanded political tool around the world and Facebook has acknowledged that it's become a tool for governments seeking to manipulate public opinion in other countries – outlining new measures to combat "information operations". Advertisement Fake fake news While Trump and other conservative politicians clearly benefited from fake news, they were quick to co-opt the term and distort its meaning. Fake news soon became another word for bias, even though they're not quite the same thing – generally fake news is a totally fabricated report while biased news gives a slanted view of real events. The latter is much harder to objectively detect. In the hands of Trump, fake news became a catchphrase to discredit any news report or fact which didn't align with his own beliefs and ambitions. Along with this came the term "alternative facts" to defend Trump's preference for facts that work in his favour. From the beginning of his campaign, Trump was not afraid to make demonstrable false public statements. His apparent ability to get away with outright lies has lowered the bar for politicians around the world and emboldened those who seek to sweep aside inconvenient truths. At the same time Trump declared war on sections of the mainstream media, declaring them an "enemy of the American people" – a phrase taken straight from the totalitarian playbook. The more the media accuses Trump of lying, the more Trump's followers trust him. Of course the mainstream media hasn't exactly covered itself in glory in the social media age, engaging in a tabloid click-bait race to the bottom to chase advertising dollars lost to the web. Fake news has actually become the victim of fake news, to the point where the term is now often evoked to describe any supposed fact with which someone doesn't agree. Fit to print So in the space of a few months the term fake news has become practically meaningless. Yet there's still a push to do something about it from the likes of Google and Facebook who realise that it's becoming a threat to their credibility as the de facto gatekeepers of the truth. Keep in mind that Mark Zuckerburg happily underplayed the impact of fake news in the early days, to protect Facebook's reputation. Until now mob rule has decided what's true on social media, but facts don't work this way – the truth is not a democracy and you can't assume that what people read and share the most must be accurate and therefore is worth spreading. The world is round, whether you like it or not. Before last year's US election, Google News was already working on a "Fact Check" concept to crack down on public comments which play fast and loose with the truth. The aim was to pick up media outlets blindly regurgitating the lies of public figures – or perhaps deliberately choosing not to question those lies – rather than to catch the outright fabrications of fake news sites. Google News isn't manually fact-checking articles, instead it's giving news sites the option to include ClaimReview tags in their articles to indicate that facts have been checked. The articles must be transparent, with citations and references to primary sources, and Google has threatened to banish news sites from Google News – cutting off their lifeblood – if they abuse the system. While it started in the United States and United Kingdom, Google's Fact Check program has recently gone global. It's already under attack as some people consider fact-checking a form of bias and political attack – as people who like to twist the facts don't like being called out on it. Fact Checking efforts are also complicated by the fact that journalists can't always name their sources, and that some journalists are prepared to hide behind this in order to support the lies of their favoured politicians. Rise of the machines Google has also changed its search algorithms recently to punish sites which promote fake news. An artificial intelligence bullshit detector, designed to sniff out fake news, is perhaps more reliable than trusting people – although AI can have its own inadvertent bias, especially if it learns from people correcting its mistakes. As with IBM Watson's efforts to help with skin cancer diagnosis, perhaps the solution is not to train AI to weed out fake news but rather teach it to identify stories which are clearly not fake – a much easier task. Then AI can hand its human masters a short-list of questionable stories rather than expecting humans to flick through every news story in search of lies and misinformation. The grape vine Of course Google's efforts will struggle to curb the spread of fake news directly through social media. Facebook is under pressure to do more, but its fake news tools might just exacerbate the problem. Rather than relying on algorithms to identify potential fake news, Facebook is instead introducing tools allowing users to flag items as fake news. The system doesn't discriminate between fabricated news and biased news, plus it relies on people knowing that a story is fake. Facebook's plan is clearly open to abuse, mob rule can't be trusted as people's opinions of fake news vary, plus some will maliciously tag accurate stories as fake. There's also the issue of bot accounts, or hacked accounts, enforcing the beliefs of their masters. Then there's the question of whether Facebook's fake news rulings will be applied universally or tailored for each user, which would just reinforce the filter bubbles which ensure that people only hear what they want to hear. Often the most important stories are truths that people don't want to hear or believe. Facebook says it also has a team of fact-checkers to investigate stories but it's been caught out in the past suppressing conservative news and using fact-checking services accused of left-wing bias. Join the crowd Rather than trusting the mainstream media or the average man on the street, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales proposes to start yet another news service in WikiTribune. Hiring professional journalists and volunteer fact-checkers, the site will be supported by reader donations. The fact that WikiTribune isn't relying on citizen journalists alone is telling. Citizen journalism was built on the idea than your average person could be trusted to tell the truth without being influenced by the mainstream media's vested interest in maintaining the status quo – it's a fair point, but in the era of fake news it's become clear that every citizen brings their own bias to the table. While it's a noble idea, WikiTribune isn't really going to solve the problem. Even if it can ensure that it doesn't present fake news, it will be just another voice in the crowd. What we really need is to know which voices we can trust, and to combat political efforts to encourage mistrust in those voices which do speak the truth. Sections of the mainstream media have abused public trust in recent times, following their own agendas and fuelling a click-bait war in which fake news could flourish. It all ties back to the original sin of giving away their content online for free, devaluing the truth and the important role which trained journalists play. Now traditional media faces an uphill battle to earn back that trust, yet dwindling new room budgets and head counts make it harder for journalists to put in the time and effort required to uncover hidden truths.

No one knows why. Researchers are puzzled by Calico’s stealthiness and say it’s not good for science. Updated by Julia Belluz@juliaoftoronto Apr 27, 2017, 10:10am EDT tweet share Calico’s logo is a labyrinth — fitting for the ultra-secretive company. Javier Zarracina/Vox In 2013, Time magazine ran a cover story titled Google vs. Death about Calico, a then-new Google-run health venture focused on understanding aging — and how to beat it. “We should shoot for the things that are really, really important, so 10 or 20 years from now we have those things done,” Google CEO Larry Page told Time. But how exactly would Calico help humans live longer, healthier lives? How would it invest its vast $1.5 billion pool of money? Beyond sharing the company’s ambitious mission — to better understand the biology of aging and treat aging as a disease — Page was vague. I recently started poking around in Silicon Valley and talking to researchers who study aging and mortality, and discovered that four years after its launch, we still don’t know what Calico is doing. I asked everyone I could about Calico and what it’s up to — and quickly learned that it’s an impenetrable fortress. Among the little more than a dozen press releases Calico has put out, there were only broad descriptions of collaborations with outside labs and pharmaceutical companies — most of them focused on that overwhelmingly vague mission of researching aging and associated diseases. The media contacts there didn’t so much as respond to multiple requests for interviews. People who work at Calico, Calico’s outside collaborators, and even folks who were no longer with the company, stonewalled me. There were no clinical trials or patents filed publicly under the Calico brand that I could find and only a few aging-related scientific papers. We should pause for a moment to note how strange this is. One of the biggest and most profitable companies in the world has taken an interest in aging research, with about as much funding as NIH’s entire budget for aging research, yet it’s remarkably opaque. Google also prides itself for being a leader on transparency and for its open culture. And we’re living in a time when the norms in science, particularly biomedical science, are centered around openness and data sharing. But these values have somehow eluded Calico. For now, I think it’s safe to say Google has not solved aging. Or if it did, they haven’t told anybody. Calico only offers the public the vaguest details about what they’re doing It’s not unusual for new startups to be stealthy for a period while they get going, but there’s usually some public statement with specific details about the technology or science being developed. That Calico won’t say what it’s doing bothers leading aging researchers. They expressed confusion or frustration about Calico’s stealthiness, and said the secrecy is not productive for science. Eric Topol is a cardiologist who studies aging and the director of Scripps Translational Science Institute. Topol knows some of the scientists at Calico from their pre-Calico days. “They’re hyper secretive,” he said. Since they moved to Google, he can’t seem to reach them. “I have invited them to speak at our program we have on genomic medicine. They say ‘no, they can’t talk about what they’re doing.’ I am not sure why that’s the case.” Nir Barzilai, a geneticist and one of the leading researchers in aging based at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was similarly perplexed. “It’s weird they don’t come to us, look at our patents … We have resources, we are eager to do partnerships and form bio-techs. And nobody from Calico talks to us.” Other top researchers on aging told me much the same. “I don’t interact with them,” Felipe Sierra, director of the division of aging biology at NIH’s National Institute on Aging, said. “They don’t want to interact with me. I ignore them as much as they ignore me.” He also invited Calico scientists to present at NIH. “They come to the meeting but they don’t talk about what they are doing … [They] wouldn’t even talk about general directions [of their research].” The problem with Calico’s secrecy There are a few potential explanations for Calico’s secrecy. Among them: that Calico is just waiting for a big reveal. A December article in the MIT Technology Review, which was also scant on details about Calico’s anti-aging science, hinted that might be the case: [David] Botstein [the Calico Chief Scientific Officer] says a “best case” scenario is that Calico will have something profound to offer the world in 10 years. That time line explains why the company declines media interviews. “There will be nothing to say for a very long time, except for some incremental scientific things. That is the problem.” But avoiding media hype does not require secrecy among scientific colleagues. If Calico’s scientists were truly interested in pushing the boundaries of science, they might think about using some of the best practices that have been developed to that end: transparency, data sharing, and coordinating with other researchers so they don’t go down redundant and wasteful paths. As Topol said, “Secretive research is passé. The world has moved on to fully demonstrate the value of openness, transparency, and avoidance of insular thinking.” There are other possible explanations for the stealthiness. A recent news release from Calico announced a partnership with C4 Therapeutics to work on coming up with drugs for "diseases of aging," such as cancer — one of a number of drug company partnership’s Calico has formed. If Calico’s now focused on drug development, then a degree of secrecy might make sense. (Drug companies typically develop their products quietly to stay ahead of the competition.) But researchers don’t buy that explanation, either. “The researchers [Calico] hired are using models such as yeasts, nematodes, and naked mole rats,” said Barzilai. “These are not the models that are relevant for drug development.” Developing cures also doesn’t fall in line with the company’s original mission — to treat aging as a genetic disease instead of hunting for treatments for age-related diseases. Another potential reason for the lack of transparency — the one I find most compelling — is that it’s the company culture. Art Levinson, the CEO of Calico, is also chair of the board of Apple Inc. and was close to Steve Jobs, who was renowned for his clandestine approach to research and development and running a business. It’s possible that Levinson has made secrecy part of Calico’s DNA, the way it’s part of Apple’s DNA. Perhaps Calico will one day justify its secrecy, Topol said. “But at this point,” he added, “I don’t understand it.” Potentially withholding information about advances in biomedical science or cures for diseases is unacceptable, he added: Lives are ultimately at stake. “Anything that slows down progress in biomedical research can’t be condoned.” For that reason, I’d like to humbly invite Calico or people who have worked with the company to share what they are up to. I promise we won’t hype it. Have information about Calico? You can send me tips over email at julia.belluz@vox.com or secure PGP. (My key: 0AC1 64FA E095 851B 112A 0670 6D24 B5A4 56ED 285E) Update: An earlier version of this story stated that I could not find Calico’s aging-related research papers.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 28 April 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Digital ad spend jumps 22% to US$72.5bil in 2016: report The increase in ad spending, which was again dominated by Facebook Inc and Alphabet’s Google, comes as marketers are increasingly wary about where their ads show up online, and how effective it is for them. — Reuters Marketers spent US$72.5bil (RM315.19bil) on digital advertising last year, an increase of 22% from 2015, as Google and Facebook once again booked the lion's share of new revenue, a report released by the Interactive Advertising Bureau said.  The Internet Advertising Revenue Report underscored a migration by consumers away from traditional forms of media like television to online and mobile platforms, which has left digital companies competing for a larger share of advertising dollars.  However, digital and television advertising is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  Analysts for the Pivotal Research Group wrote that despite digital advertising outpacing the US$69bil (RM300.25bil) spent on US television advertising in 2016, it was not taking away ad dollars as many observers would expect.  “Advertisers commonly look to allocate digital budgets to video ad units without necessarily impacting TV spending one way or the other,” the analysts said.  The increase in ad spending, which was again dominated by Facebook Inc and Alphabet’s Google, comes as marketers are increasingly wary about where their ads show up online, and how effective it is for them.  Facebook and Google accounted for 99% of the industry growth, said Pivotal Research, meaning that almost everyone else in the digital ecosystem was either flat or down from last year.  Google’s YouTube is in the midst of an ad boycott on its digital video site YouTube after companies like Verizon Communications Inc and Johnson & Johnson found their ads appearing next to extremist and other hate content.  Last year also saw Facebook admit to a string of measurement errors in the data is gives to advertisers regarding the amount of people that are watching their video ads. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Celcom to deploy ‘Lightning Fast LTE’ network in August Cyber extortion demands surge as victims keep paying: Symantec Alphabet CEO touts results of corporate restructuring Locally produced children's show goes global with Netflix Anti-Putin protesters get a smartphone app to help get out of jail Why are M'sians investing hard-earned money in Ponzi schemes?

Open GApps can now optionally install Google Assistant Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/02/02 8:38am PDTFeb 2, 2017 53 Plus 1 on G+ 244 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares402 Applications Google News Google Assistant was introduced at Google I/O last year, as a more personal voice assistant than Google Now. Since then, it has been made available on several platforms - Pixel phones, the Google Home, Android TV, and Allo. But Assistant is still unavailable on non-Pixel phones without a special build.prop tweak. Now the Open GApps team has made enabling Assistant a little easier. Starting February 3, all GApps builds will have the option to enable Google Assistant. If you're using the Gapps 'Aroma' zip, Google Assistant shows up as an option during installation. If you prefer one of the non-GUI installers, you can add the 'GoogleAssistant' keyword to the gapps-config file. Google Assistant is marked as an optional feature right now due to it not having the full feature set of Google Now. You can download all Open GApps packages here, but keep in mind that only builds starting tomorrow will include the option for Assistant.

Now on tap with google now is 100 times better. Most functions are missing from google now. Christopher Bement Works for what I need it for and it's one less tap. So, me. I want it. T4rd I just started trying Assistant with the latest PureNexus ROM on my 6P. The only thing I'm missing is the ability to copy text from screenshots/images. Seems to do everything else so far and it's much faster at reading your voice and responding. Duder12 I dont think you know what Google Now is. Google Now is the proactive assistant that shows cards about your life on the left homescreen and is still on Pixel phones. Now on tap does nothing but read your screen which honestly no one used and is being built into google assistant anyways. Suyash Limaye I use now on tap a lot. Especially ability to copy text from screenshots, copying numbers from messages etc. None of these things can be done by assistant. Also assistant can identify songs yet another missing feature. I never complained about now cards. demarcmj What used to be called "Now on Tap" is baked into Assistant. You can do all of those things with Assistant. I don't know about the identifying of songs. I use separate apps for that anyway. _jack_ I used it a lot, it is perfect for sharing screenshots without having them saved in the gallery app. Also for things like movie trailers, locations etc. it works pretty well. jonzey231 Yep, I took 100% of my screenshots this way. Never having to worry about deleting screenshots is amazing. demarcmj That's still available in Assistant Corbin Davenport Taking screenshots wasn't available in Assistant when it was first released, but now it is. demarcmj right jonzey231 Nope. Used it all the time. demarcmj Although Suyash is definitely wrong about the "100 times better" and "most functions are missing" comments, his (or her?) terminology is fine. What Google Now "is" has always been a bit unclear, because it is all just part of the same "Google" app. It is generally understood to mean the cards/feed AND the voice search. Khanjan Damania Does it require device name changes in build.prop to 'Pixel XL' or will it work on all devices regardless? megatomic This is a good question. SpasilliumNexus It shouldn't. All that's needed is the entry "ro.opa.eligible_device=true" in build.prop and a fairly recent version of the Google App. This works on Nougat, not sure about Marshmallow as I used to use Xposed for it. Even then it never spoofed my device as a Pixel. brkshr That's good to know. I didn't like my 6P showing as an XL. Just made the change back and Assistant still works. Grassy ass. Maxr1998 Apparently on MM it requires/d? device name spoofing for some people, but that never affected the Xposed module, as it just overrides the Assistant methods and bypasses any device name checks (if they do (still) exist). Source: I created the Xposed code. Sergey Wain-Fellowes (My Zest Can you give me a step by step how to do this on my Nexus 6P Mark Washington Requires Root?🤔 Patryk lul TechGuy22 maybe he just woke up lol Gjorgi Lazarovski no it does not Mark Washington You first. 🤔 ADofCLE "If you want it, you have to root". It's great that Google encourages rooting but, I don't want to. It should just be updated with the Google app. Always making things now complicated than they have to be. Gjorgi Lazarovski Google doesn't encourage rooting, they encourage buying a Pixel :) Ryan Cavitt You dont even have to flash TWRP, you can just do fastboot boot /path/to/twrp.img Then install your zip and reboot. That is assuming Opengapps' stock mode will enable you to install Assistant. Gjorgi Lazarovski Didn't know about that! Adb is amazing :) the Aroma package is the best deal IMHO, you can choose whatever you want installed/uninstalled in a simpler way for the user. Sadly is only for people who don't have data caps since 1 package is aprox 800MB in size trwnh This doesn't work on all devices. For example, the HTC 10 doesn't have "fastboot boot" support. Ben Bayes But unlocking the bootloader breaks SafetyNet and thus Android Pay, right? That's a reason I wouldn't want to do this... Gjorgi Lazarovski You have two choices, relock the bootloader which will be a pain in the ass when your next update comes or flash a custom kernel that hides the bl unlocked flag from SN, so you'd be fine. I can see how a stock user wouldn't want to do this and it might seem like too much, but it really isn't and I really think using adb to update is cleaner than using OTA. Haizum74 Wait, there's a custom kernel that hides the unlocked flag? How have I missed this? Is there any particular kernel you suggest? Randroid My bootloader is unlocked and I pass SN... chandrizzle You don't need root to apply the changes, but Verity (verified boot) needs to be disabled for the changes to stick. In the end, it's easier to just root because Verity is disabled when you go through the root process (which is what I ended up doing). D13H4RD2L1V3 That applies to the systemless method as well? Because my Moto Z is rooted via systemless root (Superuser) and the "oem_status" on the bootloader screen says "Modified" after. dm-verity doesn't seem to be tripped, though or my phone would be stuck in a bootloop by now and I would have to reflash the stock firmware. chandrizzle Maybe I used the wrong term for verification, but yes? I'm systemless rooted on all of my devices and below is what I experienced: Since the build.prop (modified to get Assistant) is one of the files that's verified at boot, it will revert any changes on reboot. I would verify the build.prop contents with adb push and pull before and after reboot. However, I used to flash modified hosts files without any modifications to /system (no root of any kind) and they would stick (bonus: ad block with working Android Pay). Makay Chapulets Hi! Can you suggest how I can use ADB to edit my build.prop to enable on screen nav bar? I don't like the hardware button on my phone... It's a mediatek 6583 and runs Android 6.0 chandrizzle I have a Mac and a Nexus, so your experience may vary. Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for what happens to your device... yadda, yadda, yadda Connect the phone to the computer with USB Boot into recovery [adb reboot recovery] Select "Mount /system" Enter this command (pick your save location): adb pull /system/build.prop /location/to/save/file Open up the build.prop in a text editor and make your edits Use the "Save as" command so you have a backup of your original Enter command: adb push /location/of/edited/build.prop /system/build.prop Reboot *Just a warning, if you have encryption or any other protection, the changes might not stick. The verified boot may undo your changes at startup. If you're already rooted, then you should be fine.* Pro tip: you can use drag and drop (folders/files) on your terminal window so that you don't have to type full paths Makay Chapulets Once I boot into recovery the minimal ADB terminal won't recognize my device anymore ADofCLE It's been a while since I've done anything like this. I was still under the impression that root access was needed to flash a system file. Daniel Marcus Of course, I'd rather like it if Google would make Assistant properly available on the Home and Nexus 5x. sweenish But not the 6P. Shane DeRidder I wish I had this on my 6P.... I just don't want to root. raptir I'm not sure I understand what has happened here. I've been running opengapps for a few weeks on my OnePlus 3T on a Nougat ROM and I have had Google Assistant available bundled into the stock Google app. It comes up instead of Now on Tap. How is this different? Gjorgi Lazarovski it's for stock users and roms that dont have GA enabled dblock The real question is, did they fix the issues with hotword enrollment in OpenGapps? Google Assistant is already optionally able to be installed through build.prop tweaks while using any Gapps package, but if the package doesn't allow for full functionality (OK Google activating while screen is off) then what is the point in the first place? danifeb I love you Nexus 5 JohnA Damn I love Android. No walls here!! Dragos Lucian The Assistant can be easily activated by a ROM's dev with only one commit (2 for things to be completed). OpenGapps are a mess and have been for a long time. The xda threads get countless complains about system apps being removed when flashing opengapps or other weird issues. The latest thing they do is to remove the pixel launcher which gets you stuck if you don't know how to get out of the trouble. I specifically instructed people to not flash them in my thread just to avoid any complains about broken stuff. Lateef Alabi-Oki It's a shame Google's most loyal customers, Nexus users, can't get Google Assistant via an update. Pneen Android ❤ Richard Corke I already have it on my oneplus one, via the app "get assistant root" it's ment for nexus devices but works fine on my oneplus iron2000 But I don't think Open GApps have "Ok Google everywhere" yet. The issue is still open in Github. TriguyRN I know on custom ROMs it takes a lot of fanangling. psychomaniac189 I HATE google assistant.

The main reason for that is software, because, at a certain point, it’s no longer worth it for a manufacturer to spend the cash needed to develop and push software updates. It happens to every phone, and it’s going to happen to the Google Pixel. Today, Google has revealed when exactly that will happen… The best gifts for Android users For both the Pixel and Pixel XL, both released in October 2016, Google will guarantee security updates through October of 2018. That gives the devices each 2 full years of guaranteed updates. There’s nothing preventing Google from going past this date, and it has in the past, but after October 2018 has passed, first-gen Pixel owners should not expect more updates. If you ask me, that’s a pretty good date to set. At that point, new devices will have come along to replace the aging Pixels, and the software may get to the point where upgrading is necessary to get the same speed that these phones offer out of the box. Security, on the other hand, is something Google should offer for longer, and it does. For the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google will continue pushing monthly security updates through October of 2019. Again, there’s nothing preventing Google from going past that date, but nothing is definite at that point. These are also the same rules Google laid out with the Nexus line, so it’s nice to see the company offering up the same commitment for newer devices.

(AP) SAN FRANCISCO—YouTube’s inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google’s digital family into a problem child. It’s not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service — one that could undercut Google’s growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet’s first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn’t start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. ADVERTISEMENT The company’s earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday’s extended trading. Cloud over YouTube But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. “There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person,” says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. “They don’t want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don’t have to because they have many other choices.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had “thousands and thousands” of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. “We are evolving overall to a better place,” Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing “extraordinary” growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won’t leave a huge dent in Alphabet’s earnings. That’s because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company’s golden goose — Google’s dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet’s revenue even as it expands into other fields. But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. ADVERTISEMENT Taking the gloss off Before the boycott began, YouTube’s ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn’t disclose YouTube’s finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn’t have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. “This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand,” says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. <b>Flight of brands At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It’s unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn’t advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn’t respond. Temporary hit or permanent scar? Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. “It’s going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away,” he said. “There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term.” Investors, however, apparently aren’t too worried so far. YouTube’s financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google’s ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet’s net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

By: Reuters | Bengaluru | Published:April 28, 2017 7:00 am Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profits, beating Wall Street estimates. (Source: Reuters) Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 per cent to USD 5.43 billion, a growth rate that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2.8 per cent to USD 916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. Google is expected to command a 61.6 per cent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 per cent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Wall Street grew anxious as a series of high-profile advertisers fled YouTube amid concerns about ads appearing alongside extremist content. But Google’s results showed that controversy was little more than a speed bump for the company as revenue rose 22.2 per cent to USD 24.75 billion from USD 20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising,” Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during an earnings call. Analysts marveled at the company’s ability to continue to post sizeable year-over-year gains from such a large base. Google’s ad revenue, which accounts for the lion’s share of its business, rose 18.8 per cent to USD 21.41 billion in the first quarter. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 per cent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 per cent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. With the traditional business of search advertising maturing, the company is looking to YouTube as its next driver of growth. The strong results also allayed concerns about a recent controversy surrounding the video service and its impact on Google’s ad revenue. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. Alphabet is also reaping the benefits of investing heavily in areas such as hardware and cloud. Revenue from its Google Other unit, which includes Pixel smartphone, Play Store and cloud business, rose 49.4 per cent to USD 3.10 billion. Net income rose to USD 5.43 billion, or USD 7.73 per share, from USD 4.21 billion, or USD 6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of USD 7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now No Comments.

Anthony Levandowski, an autonomous vehicle expert who defected from Google last year, notified Uber's staff of his decision in a Thursday email. The change was made in tandem with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, according to the email. Although Levandowski will remain at Uber, he won't be overseeing a crucial autonomous-car project while the ride-hailing service is locked in a legal showdown with Waymo, a rival started by Google eight years ago. Instead of reporting directly to Kalanick, Levandowski now will be under the supervision of a former subordinate, Eric Meyhofer, appointed to replace him during the Waymo battle. Waymo filed a lawsuit in February accusing Levandowski of illegally downloading its blueprints for a navigation technology known as lidar before founding a startup that he later sold to Uber for $680 million. That deal brought to Uber most of the employees now working in the company's Advanced Technologies Group that's building self-driving cars. Waymo is seeking a court order that would force Uber to stop its work on autonomous vehicles on the grounds that the project has been drawing on trade secrets taken by Levandowski before he left Google. Uber has denied its self-driving cars are using Waymo's technology. A hearing on Waymo's request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for May 3. If a federal judge sides with Waymo, it could hobble Uber's efforts to catch up in the still-developing field of robot-driven cars. Such vehicles could revolutionize transportation, including the rapidly growing ride-hailing industry. In his email, Levandowski told employees to keep him out of any discussions about Uber's work on its lidar system while reminding them that all of the company's self-driving car technology "has been built independently, from the ground up." By recusing himself, he wrote, "I hope to keep the team focused on achieving the vision that brought us all here."

REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo More By Julia Love and Rishika Sadam (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion (4.21 billion pounds), a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. "Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (http://bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate," dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google's non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. "We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business," Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors' concerns about Google's dependence on search, Wang said. "We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company," he said. "That is quite an impressive achievement." On the other hand, Alphabet's "Other Bets"--separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily--continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. Read More But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down."

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube If there is one reason why Amazon’s Echo platform is gaining traction so quickly is simply because unlike Apple’s Siri, Amazon did not choose to lock it into its own ecosystem. Instead the company opened it up and allowed other developers and hardware manufacturers to use its technology to integrate Alexa into non-Amazon apps and devices. It was a smart move and it is one that Google is looking to follow because the company has recently announced that they will be releasing a developer preview of the Google Assistant SDK. What this means for non-developers is that with the SDK made available to third-parties, they’ll be able to bake Google Assistant into their own devices, meaning that in the future we can look forward to alternatives to Google Home. As to what we can expect in the future, that’s hard to say but Google has suggested devices like smart mirrors that are voice-enabled as possible uses for the SDK, although we wouldn’t be surprised if we started to see more Google Home-like devices since those tend to be more generally appealing. Google is encouraging companies who are interested to reach out to them possibly for discussions, so as an end-user we guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Filed in General.

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, blew past analyst expectations for its first-quarter earnings and revenue as ads surged on mobile and YouTube, the company reported Thursday. Alphabet said it earned $7.73 per share, well up on an expected per-share profit of $7.39, and crushed the bottom line with overall revenues of $24.75 billion against a Wall Street expectation of $24.22 billion. Net income was $5.43 billion against a year-earlier $4.21 billion. Google advertising revenues were $21.4 billion, compared to a year-earlier $18 billion. During the first quarter of 2016, Google earned $6.02 per share in the first quarter on revenue of $20.2 billion. Stock in Alphabet surged 4 percent in after-hours trading to $930.05 on the strength of the earnings and revenue beats. During an analysts call on Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told investors YouTube has seen "extraordinary growth and opportunities," even as the company didn't break out specific revenue figures for the online video platform. And CFO Ruth Porat underlined how ad growth at Alphabet during the latest financial quarter was driven by mobile search, YouTube and automated ad platforms. Pichai also talked to analysts about a recent advertiser boycott over ad placement alongside offensive content on YouTube. "The feedback from our partners is very positive, and we're evolving overall to a better place," he said of industry consultations. AT&T and Verizon and other advertisers recently pulled campaigns after their ads appeared besides videos promoting terrorism and homophobia. Google depends heavily on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos, given the immense traffic of new video posted to the digital platform. Regarding the new YouTube TV service, Pichai said the live TV offering has only launched and his company is focusing first on improving the "consumer experience," while also seeing room to bolster TV ad delivery. For $35 a month, YouTube TV offers subscribers access to live TV programming from more than 50 networks, including ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and ESPN. Alphabet, led by president Sergey Brin, is the holding company that houses Google, which is made up of the internet assets, including search and YouTube.

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] Google Photos for iPhone: 4 Reasons to Try It Craig Lloyd05/29/2015 Google introduced a new Photos app yesterday and it’s now available for iPhone. Here are four reasons why you should try it out. The Google I/O 2015 keynote took place yesterday, and the company announced a handful of new things, but perhaps the biggest announcement was the new Google Photos app, which takes photo management to an all-new level. Some of the big features of Google Photos for iPhone include free unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos, a user interface that’s really easy to navigate, and a smart search function that makes searching through your photos a breeze. The app is available for iOS devices and it’s essentially a direct competitor to Apple’s own Photos app on iOS and iCloud Photo Library. While most avid iOS users probably won’t want to switch over to Google Photos cold turkey, here are some reasons as to why you should at least try out the new app. Free Unlimited Cloud Storage When you choose to let Google Photos back up your photos and videos to cloud storage, it saves them to your Google Drive account, but they don’t count against your Google Drive storage, meaning you get unlimited storage for your photos and videos. It can back up photos that are up to 16 megapixels in size and video that’s as big as 1080p without compressing them, all for free without using up your Google Drive storage allotment. Any photos and videos that are higher quality will be slightly compressed by Google, but the company’s assures users that they’ll hardly notice a difference in most cases. This is quite impressive, considering that Apple only gives you a measly 5GB for free with its iCloud Photo Library. If the Cupertino-based company wants to compete, it’ll have to change the way it handles cloud storage drastically. Cross-Platform Support The Google Photos app works on Android and also has a web interface that you can access in any browser, which looks almost identical to the mobile version. Google Photos in the web browser. The user interface in the mobile app is pretty great. You can pinch-to-zoom in and out to more or less photos at once on the screen. You can zoom out to view years worth of photos, or zoom in to only see photos that you took yesterday. Plus, you can quickly scroll up or down through your photos in any zoom settings, and there’s a small scrollbar that will appear that you can drag up or down to make scrolling even faster. Features It might not come as a surprise when I tell you that Google Photos comes with some unique features. The only question is whether users will truly like them and use them frequently. Google has been known to introduce gimmicky features in the past, Auto-Awesome being one of them. This time around, they have something called Assistant, which gives you creative suggestions for your photos and videos. Essentially, it can show you “fun new things automatically created from your photos & helps you stay organized,” whatever that means. However, Google demoed some uses during its keynote, where it can take a round of selfies that you took and turn them into an animated GIF, which is kinda cool. Again, I’m not sure if this is something that will truly be useful for users, or could just end up being turned off eventually by most users. However, there are still other useful features, like in-app photo editing, which is definitely handy to have. Photo Search One of the biggest features of Google Photos is its search capabilities. You can type in a word or phrase and Google Photos will try to bring up some photos that closely match that term. It will even recognize faces in photos. The app can also bunch up photos into collections if there are a handful of photos that look somewhat similar, like if you took a lot of photos of the Grand Canyon while you were vacationing last year. Google Photos can bring up those photos in a batch. It’s one feature that separates itself from Apple’s own Photos app, and it’s something that Google has always done well and will continue to do well. 5 Responses 05/29/2015 Sarvesh Reply Definitely gonna try this…Google is giving real tough competition to Apple now… 05/29/2015 somewhereman Reply Honestly I can’t wait for this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHSbv3EZeRc 11/05/2015 PicBackMan Reply Happy to find that now people can automatically backup iPhone photos to Google Photos app. Definitely worth a try 04/27/2017 mart world Reply this’s my first time of seeing it, let me try it 04/27/2017 michael Reply i will check this out,nice writ-up Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

You can type in a word or phrase and Google Photos will try to bring up some photos that closely match that term. It will even recognize faces in photos. The app can also bunch up photos into collections if there are a handful of photos that look somewhat similar, like if you took a lot of photos of the Grand Canyon while you were vacationing last year. Google Photos can bring up those photos in a batch. It’s one feature that separates itself from Apple’s own Photos app, and it’s something that Google has always done well and will continue to do well. 5 Responses 05/29/2015 Sarvesh Reply Definitely gonna try this…Google is giving real tough competition to Apple now… 05/29/2015 somewhereman Reply Honestly I can’t wait for this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHSbv3EZeRc 11/05/2015 PicBackMan Reply Happy to find that now people can automatically backup iPhone photos to Google Photos app. Definitely worth a try 04/27/2017 mart world Reply this’s my first time of seeing it, let me try it 04/27/2017 michael Reply i will check this out,nice writ-up Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 per cent to US$5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google's size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. "They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Shares of the company rose 2.8 per cent to US$916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 per cent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 per cent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. "Our great properties - like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play - are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested," Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 per cent to US$24.75 billion from US$20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 per cent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 per cent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to US$5.43 billion, or US$7.73 per share, from US$4.21 billion, or US$6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of US$7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate," dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. "Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. Google's non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 per cent to US$3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. "We're seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business," Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors' concerns about Google's dependence on search, Wang said. "We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company," he said. "That is quite an impressive achievement." On the other hand, Alphabet's "Other Bets"-separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily-continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet's "Other Bets," climbed to US$244 million, up from US$165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to US$855 million from US$774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google's performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. "With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility," Page wrote. "We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down."

By Rachel Middleton Updated April 28, 2017 03:12 BST A nine-picture slideshow on how camembert is made.google doodle The new Google Doodle celebrates the 256th birthday of dairy maid Marie Harel with a nine-picture slideshow that shows how Camembert cheese is made. The step-by-step narrative is drawn in a nostalgic style reminiscent of the early 20th-century French poster artists such as Herve Morvan and Raymond Savignac, says Google. Harel, who was born on 28 April 1761 in Crouttes as Marie Fountaine, is credited with creating the first camembert in 1791, with help from a cheese whisperer. According to Google, legend claims that Abbot Charles-Jean Bonvoust, a priest purportedly from the region of Brie, sought shelter at Beaumoncel, near Vimoutiers during the French Revolution, where he shared his secret for making the soft-centred cheese with Harel. Harel took it a step further, making the creation her very own by packing the cheese in its iconic wooden boxes. Harel started a dynasty of entrepreneurial cheese makers who developed the production of the camembert cheese on a large scale. Her grandson, Cyrille Paynet, started a cheese factory in the commune of Le Mesnil-Mauger in Calvados. The Marie Harel Google Doodle Like its counterpart, brie, camembert is made from raw cow's milk without cream. The cheese is yellow, carries an earthy aroma and has a creamy taste. It also has an edible white rind. Camembert made from unpasteurised milk receives the designation Camembert de Normandie. The Camembert Museum in the village of Vimoutiers, has a statue of Harel, who is celebrated for her contribution to French cheese culture.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution.

They respond within moments, but that response is always boilerplate like you mentioned. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Charles222 I usually roll with Google auto-creating events in calendar for me like they do, and the random stuff that doesn't float through my email goes to Todoist. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Charles222 Having a few Homes around the house is what pushed it for me. I'll remember some random-ass thing I need to do in the future, and I don't take my phone to bed (or have it particularly nearby generally at home) as a rule...but I do have a Home in the bedroom and just being able to talk to to Todoist to set up an event is fantastic. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. bekifft Pretty sure that one was for example, I doubt his dog's name is actually Fido. I admit it is kind of unlikely you'd get that many reminders in one notification, but it does illustrate the point that Google hasn't quite thought the system through. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v bekifft This happens to me too. Not so extreme, but it seemingly sometimes takes Google quite a while to realize I'm home for reminders. Which is strange because they bloody well know that I'm home, they spend all day burning through my battery to make sure they know where I am at all times. Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Scott Scrivens I have tried Tick-Tick actually, and I seem to remember not liking the UX. It's seems it's had a considerable makeover since then though so I'll check it out again, cheers. Jock Murray I use Business Tasks by Appgenix-software.com I don't think Google realise the importance of their Google Tasks. The ability to nest tasks and have descriptions/comments attached to each task, is critical. Keep users don't know what they're missing out on. Scott Scrivens Looks good, I'll check it out! pantagruel I use Business Calendar 2 with support for Google Tasks built in. Smarter choice if you use your calendar as well. bekifft Since we're recommending apps, this one seems the best, and uses Google Tasks as its back end. Come to think of it, I'm not sure Google Tasks even has an official front end anymore, but Google seems to have forgotten to shut it down. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.splendo Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. morrisp Well, it won't appear (or notify you) on the desktop Calendar -- but will still notify you in the Calendar app, yes? N8SLC Yes, morrisp. :) Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. F4LL0U7 If you're talking about reminders set through the Google app, you have to go into the Google app's settings and enable sound & vibration for those notifications. I think they're off by default. ellett Nope, I don't use reminders through the Google app. I do all of my calendar-related operations through Calendar. Putting appointments, reminders, notifications and alarms in different places is just plain wrong. F4LL0U7 Ha, you have a point. It might seem obvious, but you just might want to check and make sure the notification sound is enabled in Calendar also. I think that one might be off by default too. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. iCON You are talking about a company that has six different messengers... Scott Scrivens I'd say it's more about whether it's profitable, rather than whether it's possible. Sad truth. F4LL0U7 There was a recent article on AP (I forget who wrote it) about Google's messenger strategy (or lack thereof) that seemed pretty spot-on. I would bet their reminder strategy is pretty similar. bekifft That, and I don't think they've had a clear reminders strategy from the beginning, and probably still don't. With reminders tied into all these services, it's probably an engineering nightmare at this point. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Naxx ENVY ^ this , his phones on like 5% , hes like . i forgot something , let me check my list ... oh right yea charge phone . Scott Scrivens Because the battery on my Nexus 5X doesn't last the whole day. So a reminder to charge it at around 4PM is useful. I'm not always able to, but if I intend to be out of the house in the evening it's a necessity unfortunately 😩 Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different Scott Scrivens Agree with Luzandro. It's probably the best option but still not as good as the Google app input method. bekifft Yes and ironically the Google app does not yet have any app shortcuts. Add Reminder and View Reminders would be two excellent choices. TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. morrisp The stock iOS Reminders app is indeed buggy -- notifications sometimes don't go off. It's a big problem! I recently switched to using an app called MinimaList for most of my reminders. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like. Scott Scrivens You're right about this, and it does work well enough. I just wish Inbox reminder notifications wouldn't disappear after a random amount of time. Miguel Hernandez I know this may sound blasphemous to some in this community but how about Cortana? It has a widget that show upcoming reminders and easy add reminder button and is cross-device with Windows 10. Antonio Gabbiano Exactly the same thoughts that I have. The fastest way to add a reminder is via shortcut for Inbox. Hanny Yeung Google Reminder as a new separate app in 3...2...1... Btw, I use Loop for my recurring reminders. Good design & usability, plus I can track my habit performance (I saw Vitamins in your calendar and that seems to be a suitable entry for Loop). Everything else are occasional, so they're in Google, created by voice command. Agreed an app shortcut from Google app and a separation of each reminder in notifications would make life easier. Vivek Shah I completely agree with Scott. The reminder options in Google Calendar desperately needs a overhaul. Hope they're reading this. Polyterative Calendar is great but abbandoned by google.. I'm a power user and these annoyances are really bad bekifft I wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's definitely not a core product anymore. They made it to compete with Microsoft and Exchange back in the day, and it was effective at that, but that's not what they care about anymore. So actually yeah, I can see how it is kind of abandoned. _jack_ Tbh, that's why I use another app for reminders and to-dos. I hate this inconsistencies, and a dedicated service for reminders isn't a bad idea (especially when using them extensively). makapav Not to mention there is no option to make the reminder notification more aggressive: intensity, repeat, persistence. vodanium I really miss that, too! Sometimes I want a reminder to really grasp my attention to do the task at the very moment. In other cases, though, it is not an issue to miss the notification for a few minutes/hours - most of the to-do activities are like this. I've been using The Clock app for "hard" notifications, but it is far from being ideal: e.g. it can be used for reminders within one week only, no option for sophisticated recurrences (e.g. bi-weekly), etc. makapav In other words - it's a usability clusterfuck. bekifft I've started using this app specifically for recurring reminders. Not sure whether it's a good thing or bad thing that Google leaves these gaping holes to third party providers, but here check it out: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bleyl.recurrence&hl=en Rafael Reinoldes Not to mention their task management system, We can create a task list in keep, export it to docs and suddenly they were not tasks anymore, while gmail still have a half-baked task functionality that doesn't support remainders, but supports nested items!! Rafael Reinoldes Forgot about the inability to import lists from docs to keep again Rafael Reinoldes Did you said 'chrome'?!? How could anyone set a remainder from chrome? Scott Scrivens Search "add reminder" in Google. As long as you're signed into your Google account you'll get this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b7f84553cb8c9298712a98dc6a5f355c79fb13f00154d89a39eaa785046cdab9.png Rafael Reinoldes Not working here, even in an anonymous tab, probably only available in US, tested in android and desktop from Brazil. Scott Scrivens Interesting. I'm in the UK and it works for me. Maybe not everywhere though. Sorry to get your hopes up. You are signed into Google right? Rafael Reinoldes I am logged into google, mainly, because I get a lot of value by syncing stuff across different computers. Scott Scrivens That's annoying, not sure why it wouldn't work in Brazil :( Nathan Type "add reminder" in the Chrome address box. I do it all the time on my PC because it is faster than picking up my phone, but I was also experiencing problems with notifications for reminders set in Chrome not appearing on any of my devices. Now I know why. Rodrigo Chiong It's true that the reminders situation a mess. But I do see a launcher shortcut to add reminders from Inbox that work alright. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dc3b51117bfc2b134dc2fdf28b442f4389a3730166e304ee5ae2969fbe776d83.png Scott Scrivens This is true, and it does work pretty well. The only issue is that, as others have pointed out, Inbox reminder notifications seem to disappear after a little while. I like to leave my reminder notifications in the shade until I get to them. Rodrigo Chiong Well that's also true. You never know if the notification will come from Calendar, Keep, Inbox or the Google app and they all behave differently (particularly the snooze feature) KB You don't need "add reminder" in the search box, just typing "reminder" is sufficient. Dan While adding a reminder in chrome only allows times in 30 minute increments, there is a workaround for at least this part: include the specific time (and optionally the actual reminder text itself) in your 'add reminder' search: 'add reminder 7:40pm' will pre-fill the time for you (although changing the time will still only allow the 30 minute incremented time values) or just search the entire reminder: 'add reminder take out the trash at 7:40pm' or 'remind me to take out the trash at 7:40pm' hopefully this helps someone else Scott Scrivens Great find. As a way of crowdsourcing fixes this is proving very worthwhile. Chris Sanner lessee....what else about reminders bugs me - 1) if you want to dismiss a recurring notification early one dya your only option is to dismiss it *forever* 2) no "repeat x time after completion" option. this is the thing that most keeps me on other todo apps. I might not replace my furnace filter ON THE DAY it's due - but I want to be reminded again a month after I *DO* replace and dismiss it. Joe Dink AMEN! So true! It's pathetic. On such a good platform, otherwise. Chris I agree the reminder system has some shortcomings. I was frustrated recently when the assistant had all but removed entering a reminder by typing if you're in a situation where you can't use your voice. So, I wrote this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccwilcox.quickreminders Its shortcuts to create Google reminders. I depend on reminders, as well Scott Scrivens That looks really useful. Incompatible with my 5X though sadly... Chris Not compatible with the 5X? I'll look into that asap and fix that... Scott Scrivens Let me know when you do, I'll give it a whirl. Chris What country are you in? Are you in the US? Currently, I have the Play Store distribution set to US only for compatibility with Google's app service F4LL0U7 I recently got Android Wear 2.0 on my GWR, and noticed that I don't even receive reminders on there anymore! I set all my reminders through Google Now, and last night I got a monthly reminder at 9pm on my phone. Nothing at all showed up on my watch. I navigated to the Reminders app on my watch, and the recurring reminder was in the list, but it showed zero current reminders. WTF! Seems like this might be a leftover bug from AW 1.x, where I would receive reminders right on time on my watch, but they were not actionable. If I tried marking one as done, it would think for a few seconds, and then I'd get the frowning cloud icon saying I wasn't connected. But I WAS connected, damn you Google! Josh A The app shortcuts u said Google should add on the home screen can be added to the home screen by holding on the icon again. For example, look at the pic added https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae1ec39a9aa7517f5e7184c8e8332418e71499a85ea1c56450445ad292f0ba61.png Patrick O’Hara To me, the issue isn't getting reminders into the device. The issue is that there is only 1 type of reminder and it's easy to miss. There should be multiple reminder types. Silent, visual, audible, and urgent, for example. I've set lots of reminders that I never got because my volume was turned down. myssi GIVE ME REMINDER WITH DURATION!! Trip66 To find all your reminders all you have to do is say Okay Google show me my reminders and scroll the list the most recent ones are usually on top I've never had any problems finding them. Devin Quesenberry Scott, hang in there pal. You're not alone in your struggle. I've been trying to find a digital solution for my non-scheduling mind since the Trapper Keeper days. Some days I still have to carry around pen and paper, but I'm grateful for google reminders nonetheless. When Inbox came out I signed up because I liked the idea of merging my to-do list with my email (I wish Google would capitalize on this more, but it seems to me that they are starting to take the shotgun approach to development in general). However, I still find myself needing other apps like Keep and Onenote to get the job done. Reminders help me compartmentalize the many hats I have to wear between work, home, and volunteer life, so DO NOT APOLOGIZE for having reminders to do basic things like charge your phone, use the bathroom, or bathe every once in awhile. I even have reminders to check in on my mom from time to time (i.e. reminders to be a decent human being). Loved this article. Fong Yang I'm also a heavy user of reminders and I see the same problems. I hope Google fixes this soon. bekifft You're not alone, I would have written almost exactly this article if I could find the words. I've come to most of the same conclusions you have. Keep is by far the best way to handle reminders through Google, as it's the only one that lets you specify an arbitrary location at which to be reminded. The reason reminders haven't been added to Google Home yet is likely precisely because of this mess. God only knows what it looks like on the back end. Andrey Balandin You're very right in pointing out these deficiencies and I totally support that the experience is inconsistent. However, to be fair you are not using the right view in the calendar for your purposes. There is value in having one app which can show you all of the reminders created by all different methods together with other events and calendar is a good place for this, isn't it? To avoid this cluttered look which makes the calendar unusable you should just switch to schedule view. YuCMi You forget that Google's business strategy is to have clones of each of their products. Rob It's worth adding that you can only add a reminder using the Google app if you have Google Now cards activated (I don't, because I find it otherwise useless).

YouTube’s inability to keep ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google’s digital family into a problem child. The key question is whether a recently launched ad boycott of YouTube turns out to be short-lived or the start of a long-term marketing shift away that undercuts Google’s growth, as well as Alphabet Inc., its corporate parent. (AP Photo/Danny Moloshok, File)More SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — YouTube's inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child. It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service — one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. The company's earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. CLOUD OVER YOUTUBE But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. "There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person," says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. "They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices." Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had "thousands and thousands" of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. "We are evolving overall to a better place," Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing "extraordinary" growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings. That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose — Google's dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. TAKING THE GLOSS OFF Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. "This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand," says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. FLIGHT OF THE BRANDS At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. TEMPORARY HIT OR PERMANENT SCAR? Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. "It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away," he said. "There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term." Read More Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

Related YouTube ad boycott could spell trouble for Alphabet's Google Senators try to speed up deployment of self-driving cars Published: Monday, February 13, 2017 @ 5:12 PM By: The Associated Press In this Thursday, Aug. 18, 2016, photo, Uber employees test a self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid car, in Pittsburgh.(Jared Wickerham/AP) Jared Wickerham/AP WASHINGTON — In the first major congressional attempt to address the advent of self-driving cars, two senators said Monday they're launching a bipartisan effort to help to speed up the deployment of the vehicles on the nation's roads. Republican John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and Democrat Gary Peters of Michigan, said they're exploring legislation that "clears hurdles and advances innovation in self-driving vehicle technology." The senators' counterparts in the House are also gearing up to address the new technology, with a hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Automakers cite federal requirements that all vehicles must have steering wheels and brake pedals as examples of regulations that presume there will be a human driver and might inhibit the introduction of self-driving cars. Congressional action may be needed to make changes. "Without changes to those regulations, it may be years before the promise of today's technology can be realized and thousands of preventable deaths that could have been avoided will happen," Michael Ableson, General Motors' vice president of global strategy, plans to tell the House Energy and Commerce Committee, according to prepared testimony. Proponents of self-driving cars say they hold the potential to dramatically reduce traffic deaths by eliminating human error, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says is a factor in 94 percent of all fatal crashes. More than 35,000 people were killed on the nation's roads in 2015, up over 7 percent from the previous year. Traffic deaths surged an additional 8 percent in the first nine months of last year. Automakers also say that states are moving ahead with their own regulations, creating the potential for a confusing "patchwork" of laws. "Our effort will also include a discussion on the existing patchwork of laws and regulations and the traditional roles of federal and state regulators," Thune and Peters said in a joint statement. Safety advocates have urged the government to set standards that specifically address the safety of self-driving cars. The Obama administration last year issued a voluntary set of safety goals for makers of self-driving cars to meet with the understanding that enforceable regulations could follow. The Trump administration hasn't yet indicated what approach it will take to the technology. Some people may first experience riding in a self-driving car by hailing an on-demand, ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft. Uber began offering passengers rides in autonomous cars with a human as a backup driver last year in Pittsburgh. Joseph Okpaku, Lyft's vice president of government relations, says in prepared testimony for the House hearing that the company's goal is "to operate a pilot in a major city this year that will permit consumers to enjoy, for the first time, a Lyft in an autonomous vehicle." Tech crawl: Passenger-carrying drones and new features from Google Maps Published: Monday, February 13, 2017 @ 11:02 AM By: American-Statesman Staff The EHang 184 autonomous aerial vehicle is desplayed at the EHang booth at CES International in Las Vegas. (John Locher/Associated Press) John Locher/Associated Press Happy Monday, Austin. Hope your weekend was a good one. As you settle into the work week, here’s a look at some of the technology stories building a buzz around the Interwebs this morning: Passenger carrying drones? Yes, please! In Dubai, government leaders have an idea for battling traffic jams: a passenger-carrying drone.  Yes, seriously. Dubai officials say they hope to have the passenger-carrying drone -- which is a Chinese-made device known as the EHang 184 -- buzzing through the skyline of the city-state as soon as July. The craft can carry a passenger weighing up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) and a small suitcase. After buckling into its race-car-style seat, the craft's sole passenger selects a destination on a touch-screen pad in front of the seat and the drone flies there automatically. It’s hard to know if the egg-shaped, four-legged craft will really take off as a transportation alternative in this car-clogged city. "This is not only a model," said Mattar al-Tayer, head of Dubai's Roads & Transportation Agency. "We have actually experimented with this vehicle flying in Dubai's skies.” Here’s hoping it works. And that we can get a fleet of them for Austin. New features for Google Maps Google Maps is rolling out a new feature that lets you create Spotify-like "playlists" of favorite local spots on Google Maps that you can then share with friends. The idea is, obviously, pretty similar to Foursquare, but with Google’s size and reach,  the idea is a huge network of lists can be created that gives users "a speed-dial-like network of places if you're trying to figure out where to dine or visit on short notice," Engadget writes.  TechCrunch and The Verge also weigh in on the new Google feature and its possible uses, with The Verge piece wondering if Google Maps is trying to step into the social network space. New tech might mean better Wi-Fi We’d all like better, more consistent Wi-Fi networks, right? Well, Qualcomm on Monday rolled out some new technology that some tech experts say could make your home Wi-Fi a lot better. Mashable’s Raymond Wong has a piece on how the new Qualcomm tech works, and what it might mean for you. Spotify helps listeners cook turkey with Thanksgiving-themed playlists Published: Tuesday, November 22, 2016 @ 3:09 PM By: Jackie Wang (Spotify) Spotify Spotify wants to help you cook your Thanksgiving turkey just right. Time for Turkey, the streaming service's holiday-specific program,  gives users three steps for a perfectly-done turkey: provide the turkey's weight, choose what genre of music you'd like to listen to, and enjoy. Genres include Americana, "Family Time," "Feeling Thankful," "Club Kitchen," "Freshly Baked" and "Golden Oldies." Each themed playlist name works off of the genre. For example,  the "Freshly Baked" playlist brings out the newest hits for you to enjoy some never-tasted-before singles. "Family Time" includes songs that every generation can enjoy, such as "I'm A Believer" by the Monkees or "Riptide" by Vance Joy. Unfortunately, none of the playlists include the classic Thanksgiving songs of Bob's Burgers, including one of the best Thanksgiving song collaboration of all time. While the songs themselves may not be Thanksgiving-themed, the variety of turkey accompaniment that Spotify has provided contributes so much to the dinner process. Even if only for timing purposes, Time for Turkey will add to your Thanksgiving feast. In an age where we see Christmas advertisements earlier and earlier each year, this feels like a good way for a company to give Thanksgiving a nod of acknowledgment. Helmet for treating depression being used in Austin Published: Thursday, June 30, 2016 @ 2:51 PM Updated: Wednesday, June 29, 2016 @ 5:18 PM By: Omar L. Gallaga - American-Statesman Staff Danny Pyka, a patient at Senior Adult Specialty Healthcare, is fitted with a helmet from Brainsway Ltd. on Tuesday, June 28, 2016, which is used for treatment of major depression. Pyka says he noticed immediate improvement the same week he started treatments.(Omar L. Gallaga) Omar L. Gallaga Danny Pyka, an Austinite who worked for Mercedes-Benz for about 10 years, had been suffering from depression for so long and so severely that he was certain his suicidal thoughts would eventually lead to the end of his life. "It was just miserable," said Pyka, who found work as a handyman, but found it difficult to have a normal life or relationships with his wife and 18-year-old daughter not affected by his condition. "I was secluding myself... I'd close the house off and just sleep pretty much the whole day." Many attempts at medicating the problem over 10 to 15 years failed. He heard through a friend that studies were being done on a new technology, Deep TMS, or Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, from a New Jersey and Tel Aviv-based company called Brainsway. Pyka was able to get the treatment in Austin and says he noticed an improvement after the first week of about nine weeks of treatments. "The suicidal thoughts were ruminating thoughts that affected me throughout my daily life. After the first week and so on, they just dissipated. I'm very fortunate and very happy that it worked for me," Pyka said. This Deep TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) machine is being used to treat depression. Different versions of it are also currently being tested for other kinds of treatment.(Contributed by Brainsway Ltd.) Contributed by Brainsway Ltd. Pyka had the treatment done at Senior Adults Speciality Healthcare in Northwest Austin, which has been working with TMS technology for about two and a half years. TMS works through a mounted helmet that generates an electrical pulse, not unlike the technology in an MRI. Patients cycle through two-second pulses followed by 20 seconds of rest for each sequence, called a "Train," and it's repeated for about 20 minutes. Treatments are done daily for about six weeks, followed by a three week tapering off period. Different patients may require a different power intensity depending on each patient's motor threshold, the number of sequences is the same for all patience. The pulses for this particular treatment (there are others being tested for other afflictions) target the primary motor cortex. The low-level electrical charge affects mood regulation, retraining the nervous system to work correctly. Dr. Jaron Winston says that unlike electroconvulsive treatment, or shock treatment, which can have severe side effects, TMS has proven for many of his patients to be the a less invasive treatment for chronic depression that works more effectively than medication. "About 60 percent of patients (within our clinic) go into total remission of their depression; 60 to 70 percent had significant reduction of depressive symptoms," Winston said. Clinical studies of the technology since its FDA approval for treating depression in 2008 have bolstered the view that it can be effective for some who have not gotten results from medication or for those who've relapsed into depression,. The National Institute of Mental Health has funded studies into the technology, which lists it on its website alongside electroconsulsive therapy. The American Psychiatric Association includes TMS in its 2010 guidelines for treating major depressive disorders  and the organization says it will be updating those guidelines soon with more recent research. Winston said that patients can experience some minor pain from the pulse as nerves on the scalp are stimulated, but that it typically goes away, which Pyka said was his experience. "It feels like somebody thumping on the right side of your head for the amount of seconds" the machine runs, Pyka said. But by the third or fourth treatment, he said, "it gets more simple to do. I’ve honestly nodded off a couple of times in the chair. You get used to it." In the U.S., Deep TMS is only FDA-approved for use in treating depression, and Winston says that insurance typically won't cover followup maintenance appointments or the treatment itself unless medications have used and failed to treat the depression.  Off-label treatments being tested using other versions of the technology could help treat post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar depression and even smoking addiction by stimulating other parts of the brain. Winston said that many potential patients and even some doctors and psychiatrists are unaware that the technology exists and is available, particularly for people who aren't responding to medication.  "It's another treatment to help make (patients) functional again, to make them come out of their depression and withdrawal states," Winston said. "As treatment goes by, they will say they've never felt this well, their thinking is clearer, their cognition is better, than can focus, their mood is better, sleep is better. But there's still people who don't know anything about it." Pyka, who has completed treatment with Deep TMS, says he's been more productive and is now able to enjoy watching his daughter grow up without taking five or six medications a day (he only takes medication for sleep issues now).  The crying and worrying, he says, has subsided. "It's been a life-changing experience."

At this year’s CES, it was hard to find a product that didn’t have Amazon Echo functionality. Now, Google has released the Google Assistant SDK so that developers can start implementing it into products. What smart appliances do you want to have Assistant built-in? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases In Google’s announcement, the company gave the examples of a smart mirror and as well as robots that could utilize the voice assistant. The options are pretty much endless but the key items that could get the most traction are most likely smart versions of the appliances already in people’s homes. Currently, the Google Assistant SDK is still in developer preview so it is limited in functionality. That means that hot word and companion application integrations are not yet ready, but by the time a company is prepared to release a product with Assistant built-in, hopefully, the SDK will be fully functional. So, now that the Google Assistant can be built into almost any smart appliance, where would like to see it implemented? Answer the poll below and let us know your thoughts in the comments!

It is also about 20 kilometres south of Digya National Park, which is home to a large elephant population and several unique primate species. Nearby Google Street views display a distinct lack of grand Victorian architecture, prestigious boutiques and high-end retailers.

Google is no different but the good news is that at least Pixel/Nexus owners have an expiry date to look forward to. Google has recently published updated timeframes on its website in which they indicate when support and updates for its Pixel and Nexus devices will end. Starting with the Nexus, owners of the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X can expect that Android version updates will no longer be guaranteed after September 2017, and that there will also be no guaranteed security patch updates after September 2018. As for the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google says that there will be no guaranteed Android version updates after October 2018, and no guaranteed security patches after October 2019. Note that Google’s wording says that there is no guaranteed updates, meaning that while there is a chance that the Pixel and Pixel XL could see an update to 2019’s Android, it is not a guarantee that it will. We suppose this is normal especially given the nature of carrier contract lengths in which users are usually given options to upgrade to a newer handset, sometimes even after the first year.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Update To Google Trips Makes It Easier To Plan Your Holiday By Tyler Lee on 04/27/2017 16:47 PDT One of the nifty features we love about Inbox by Gmail is that it can automatically sort your emails for you and bundle them together. For example if you booked flights and a hotel to a particular destination, the platform is smart enough to bundle it all together under a single trip for easier access. However if you’d rather not keep opening your email, not to worry as Google also has a separate app in the form of Google Trips, and the good news for users is that Google has recently made an update to the app that will make it easier for users to plan and manage their next holiday. For starters in addition to being able to capture flight information from your Gmail inbox, Trips can now add bus and train tickets to your itinerary as well. Users can also enter details manually in case the information was not registered or made at the last minute. The app will also now let users share their reservations straight from the app to email, so you can plan a trip and then share the information with friends or family members who are part of it as well. Users will also be able to download information about a place before they go so that in the event there is no internet, not to worry as they’ll be covered. The update is live so head on over to the iTunes App Store or Google Play for the download. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Android, Apps, Google and iOS.

Google Photos v2.14 is preparing personalized experiences and sharing suggestions based around facial recognition [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:08pm PDTApr 26, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 62 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News When the Photos app launched in 2015, Google had already been working on computer vision for many years. It was no surprise that object recognition was a major draw for the app, and automatic sorting of pictures by person with the use of facial recognition became a must-have feature. Google is now looking to leverage this technology to make the Photos app a bit more social. A teardown of the latest Photos update reveals the service will soon offer additional features based around facial recognition, and even encourage users to share pictures with the people detected in them. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Since facial recognition is a sensitive privacy topic, it's worth a quick sanity check to reduce confusion and knee-jerk reactions going into this teardown. Everything discussed here is opt-in and the features will not work if users do not select a photo of themselves, and that means nothing can happen accidentally or without granting permission. Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. I'll leave it up to each reader to determine how they feel about the remaining functions and their practical implications. Face recognition for personalization, sharing, and more Instead of opening with the reason this feature might be useful, I'm going to jump straight to a summary of how Google is going to present it. Quite simply, the Photos app is going to ask users to "personalize" their experience by selecting a picture of themselves from the list of previously identified faces. If you already named yourself, the group might be renamed "Me" after making the selection. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_title">Personalize Google Photos by labeling your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_desc">Which face is yours?</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_picker_face_picker_title">Select your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_confirmation_toast_msg">All set! Try searching for “Me”.</string> Face recognition isn't just the tool, it's actually part of the pitch to get users interested. Google's explanation is broken up into two parts, the first of which offers to reward users for choosing a face with "personalized search, creations, and more." <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc0">Get personalized search, creations, and more based on your face?</string> Personalized search is explained by the toast message above – it just means you can search for "me" to find pictures of yourself. I assume "creations" are the same auto-generated albums, collages, and animations we usually see in the Assistant tab, but obviously focused on you, the user. Both of these sound like things we have now. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc1">Allow your contacts' Google Photos apps to recognize your face in photos for faster sharing? &lt;a href=help:&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;</string> It's the second part of the explanation where things get interesting. If you have identified your face for Google Photos, you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken. To be clear, this can only happen for people if they are in your contact list and if you've given permission for it to make matches.

settings for managing the new facial recognition features, but they are just there to turn the grouping features on and off, or to change the face you selected in the past – perhaps you tapped on the

My biggest question is what users will see after they take a picture of somebody else and a match is made. Primarily, will the photographer be prompted to share the photo, will it quietly include some visual marker that somebody was detected, or will it remain quiet and simply make intelligent suggestions if the share button is pressed? A big feature like this is probably not going to trigger quietly, so I expect notifications, but that could get pretty overwhelming after something like an office party or family reunion. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many unanswered questions, and since the implementation isn't done and there are missing pieces, there aren't going to be answers quite yet. The potential problem for features like this is that they tip-toe right up to the line where many people feel uncomfortable about potential privacy issues. It looks like Google has done a good job of designing barriers to avoid some of those issues, and it's clear users are responsible for making their own decisions. It's important that this is an opt-in feature by default. I do like the idea of using facial recognition to smooth out the rough edges of sharing photos with people, especially if it also acts as a reminder. I admit, I have a bad habit of taking pictures of friends and forgetting to share them later. If this goes well, Google might have the killer feature that turns Photos into a must-use service.

I get that Goog does this type of thing, but dang... Willie Chalmers III I really doubt that's going to happen. It's a slippery slope, and if they wanted to do that, they likely would have done it by now to some extent, and people would notice. James Briano Oh, Google already knows. When I search Drive for "Best Buy" I get a lot of interesting results. Example attached. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/45ff7b47285e47474877510e0456d559a7344aca80b48062d208178aa0e33897.jpg Theo Logian There is likely location data attached to that photo rather than image recognition of that big yellow tag. tik Yup... location based versus recognizing text in the image. trekker Photos face recognition is brilliant - especially when visiting a friend and quickly being able to find photos from the past to enjoy together. However currently they decide who gets a name label (or tag) and this means i have many people who remain unsearchable. Please can we manually add names ourselves? The system where Google provides choices for names does not work. Prosti95 Maybe I misunderstand you, but AFAIK you are able to name them by yourself. trekker Only the faces selected by Google can be named. There are about 300 you have as choices and once they are named there are only many from crowd shots selected which are options. I have many more people from years ago in scanned photos who I would like to name and be able to successfully search for. Currently impossible as there is no manual selection (which was an option in Picasa). whispy_snippet "you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken." Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? If I go to the auto generated "people" album I can see a whole bunch of photos of people clustered via facial recognition. Yes, I had to turn this feature on and individually label people, but the end result is now effectively the same. My app recognises faces. Jens M Eichkorn What's new is that it will associate faces with actual names / Google accounts whispy_snippet Sure, I understand that. But what I'm trying to say is that if a user chooses to do so, they can make Google Photos do this already. The tear down gives the impression that a person needs to opt-in to allow their face to be recognised in images taken by someone else. What I'm saying is that I can already go into my Photos app, enable face recognition, label some faces and bam, I'm getting the same result. This teardown suggests people can soon can opt-in to something that's already effectively live anyway. What seems new is that the process looks more streamlined. But I'd have thought many people would be more concerned with a right to opt-in to facial recognition, not a right to opt-in to a more streamlined process. Am I making sense? I feel like I'm not articulating myself well here. Cody Toombs You're making sense, and perhaps this is a part I could have explained differently, or more completely, maybe? This isn't really the easiest thing to explain, especially with so many missing pieces. Anyway, here's the main difference as far as I can tell right now: In its current state, facial recognition occurs in the cloud with all of the pictures you've taken and matching faces are placed into groups. These groups can then be named. You obviously know that part. The thing about these face matchings is they don't exist beyond your account, nor do they actually correlate to your contact list or social graph. The real world comparison would be that you've been handed a stack of photos and asked to find all the instances of a random face, put them in a stack, then put a post-it note on top of it with a random name. I believe this isn't considered a privacy issue (except in Europe) because it's all based on data that belongs to you. This new feature performs the same matching, but it uses an image (or maybe many images) belonging to somebody else to perform the matches, even if those images never actually reach you. Google is still transmitting some information to you that relates to another person, even if it's only to confirm that there's a match and it's somebody that has you in their contact list. Additionally, and this part is super unclear at this stage (I kinda avoided bringing it up in the post for obvious reasons), we don't know if Google will transmit any additional information, which may include the person's name or some sort of contact details to make it possible to share the photo. For example, this might explain why some stuff related to Google+ contacts turned up in the last teardown of Photos (link). I personally don't worry about these things, but some people obviously do, and that's why users should give permission for it to happen. whispy_snippet Thanks very much for the explanation, Cody. Much appreciated. I guess any analysis based on incomplete information is always going to be a tough game to play. You obviously have the disclaimer at the start of each APK teardown for a reason! We'll just have to wait and see how it all plays out. As a general rule I'm definitely not the type to get paranoid or concerned about Google having mountains of data on me. I use just about every Google service there is, including Google Photos, and love the trade off​ of my data for web services. But yeah, many people do get concerned about these things and I can respect their position. I try to keep in touch with both sides of the fence on these discussions. JG Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? From the article: Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. whispy_snippet Ah yep, I must have missed that bit. Well it makes sense. But yeah, I guess my other key question still stands - why is there a need to give people the option to opt-in to something that's effectively out of their hands? Your face can already be recognised in someone else's Google Photos "people" album. David Hyman What if it knew you were together and it automatically shared the pictures with other people. Basically automatically creating a shared album Paul_Werner I'd love that Mark Dodsworth Automatic sharing is never a good thing, I'm sure that the shared album thing is going to happen. One of the guys in charge of Google Photos was behind this app: https://vimeo.com/46398388 Mark Dodsworth If you want to see more about how the above app worked here's a video: https://youtu.be/0T9Ii37yuKw it used location to match people in shared albums. I bet location sharing will be added to facial recognition in Google Photos. Cody Toombs I tend to agree with Mark. Automation is good, but when it involves sharing potentially private data, things can get harry really fast. I would want the app to ask my permission before sharing anything with somebody else. Just think of all the backlash Facebook received when people started discovering there had been intentional loopholes to allow things to become more public than they were intended to be. Kevfromspace Any news on printing Google Photos albums a la Apple Photos Books? Cody Toombs You know, something about that did turn up last year in August (link), but I haven't seen any activity on it since. I think the couple of things related to that were also removed, so it may have been scrapped or placed on a backburner for now. Kevfromspace Damnit! Ever since I read that original teardown post last year I've been waiting patiently, hoping I could print an album of a trip I did with my girlfriend before her birthday this June. Looking more unlikely by the day. sodsavage Or just better printing options in general, theres next to none right now. Some of us still do like prints of our photos, smh. rickneworleansla I've been wondering about this also. Currently I have to download then re-upload to a photo printing service. Seems like google could make some money by mailing out photos, digital DVD copies, movies, etc. Their current full album download process is terrible and failed the three times I tried. I probably have too many photos. The files were huge. tik Definitely excited with all of the new updates. But, at the same time, it'd be great if Google Photos could... - Batch edit pictures - Batch remove pictures/albums from Google Photos (instead of the 1500 picture limit) - Batch download pictures to device Si vis pacem, para bellum The feature I am waiting for the most is some damn basic drawing tool while editing a photo... Basicly that's why I am still using the Samsung default gallery as my primary gallery app on both my smartphone and tablet. oningam about face recognition I would like to force it on some contacts that for some reason are not picked up or they are only at a later time. Also I'd like to get a numeric badge on each thumb to know the number of images in it and also a way to know if there are new association because quite frequently I have to go trough all of them and remove wrong matches on already identified people. About editing I'm still waiting for a way to modify date and insert position on single and batch of selected pictures. DavidB23 Agree 100% on all counts. An easy way to edit the dates in batch or one at a time is at the top of my list of improvements Ibrahim Yusuf A feature that Europe won't get 😑 Mark Dodsworth That's the thing I worry about seeing this, a pretty huge feature to miss out on. Tomáš Petrík If at least they made it opt-in, so that I could willingly enable that... Markoff As European I am fine with that actually. Ibrahim Yusuf I'm glad that Europe has these privacy laws, but I want to have the choice to opt-in to some of these features even if I sacrifices some of my privacy osullz I think it's bizarre that I still can't search for photos with the phrase 'Person X AND Person Y' or ask the Google Assistant to "show me photos of Person X AND Person Y." Facebook's Knowledge Graph is able to do that much and Google surely could as well. Mark Dodsworth I do those searches in Google Photos all the time, you can separate names by comma or and. Urmil Shroff Damn, Photos is getting cooler and cooler. Markoff indeed, was fan of 3rd party galleries like Piktures, but gave up having Photos in phone just for online backup and Piktures for viewing photos, when they pushed video stabilizing update, tne I just got rid off Piktures on mine and wives phone as well though I am not fan of providing facial data to google, so I am not using this feature Ola Stensson So are they EVER gonna launch the face feature at all outside the US? I think it's been two years now... jeremylea I still wish they would tag bad photos and suggest automatically deleting them... For an AI, detecting pictures of fingers, carpets, ceilings, motion blur, all black, all white, etc., etc., should be easy, and the training sample is already there - just look in people's trash. Al Ked One thing I wish they'd add is de-duplication. Backing stuff up from a few different sources I always end up with some duplicates. It would be cool if it found them out and allowed me to remove the duplicates.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile How to Free up Storage on Your Android Device with Single Tap, Courtesy Google Photos By Zara Ali 8 hours ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit With each passing year, the camera on our smartphone is getting better and better. Flagships like Google Pixel have received accolades for producing DSLR level images. The only side effect of quality enhancement is the size of images produced by such camera. It indirectly eats up the limited storage on our phones. There is always an option to slide in a microSD card but what about the devices without a slot? Or what about the users who don’t want to rely on a microSD card? No sweat, Google Photos has got you covered. Not many users know about this amazing feature on Google Photos that lets you free up storage on your device without any hassle. Most of us have Google Photos synced on our Android phones for backing up pictures and videos. Related Google Assistant Can Now Run on Any Device, Thanks to a New Software Development Kit All the media gets stored on Google servers, which makes it redundant to have the same media on your phone storage. Have you ever thought how much storage you can save if you get rid of all the media from phone gallery that is already backed up on Google Photos? A feature on Google Photos only removes backed up photos and videos from your gallery and saves you from the pain of selecting photos manually. Within minutes, it will free up a significant amount of storage on your device. Just one tap to clean it all! All you need is a good internet connection. It only removes backed up photos from “Camera” section of the gallery. It means that your WhatsApp or any other app’s media folder will remain untouched. Advertisement Here’s how you can use Google Photos to delete backed up photos from your device’s gallery: Open the Google Photos app on your phone Sign in with your Google Account Tap on Menu and then select “Free up space” option It will then perform a check to calculate how many photos and videos have been backed up Related Google Home Wants to Be Your Cooking Assistant with More Than 5 Million Recipes After the calculation completes, it will show how many photos and videos will be removed To get rid of all the backed up media from your phone, tap “Remove.” You will now see the progress of removal process (time depends upon the volume of media) Once the process completes, go back to Gallery on your phone, and you will see that all the photos and videos in the “Camera” section are gone, total wipeout. Don’t worry; all these photos are now backed up on Google Photos, and you can access them anytime Try out this method and let us know if it helped you in getting rid of storage woes on your device.

 Read Larry Page's new letter about the current status of Alphabet, Google's parent company Dave Smith Apr. 27, 2017, 1:26 PM 13,896 facebook linkedin twitter email print Larry Page.Andrew Kelly/Reuters Almost two years ago, Google announced it would change its name to Alphabet, which would effectively be a holding company for Google and its various businesses — YouTube, Android, etc. — as well as Google's moonshots factory, X, its investment arms, and more. In a letter to Alphabet shareholders on Thursday, CEO Larry Page, a Google cofounder, said Alphabet was "working well" in overseeing and guiding its companies and that "there's a lot more to come." Page provided updates on Alphabet's projects and companies, but there wasn't much talk about Google itself, aside from some compliments for Google CEO Sundar Pichai and his various undertakings, such as getting machine learning and artificial intelligence into more consumer products like smartphones and smart-home devices. While Page didn't announce any news in this letter, it provides an interesting bird's-eye view of Alphabet's projects and how far they've come in the past year-plus. He emphasized Alphabet's self-driving-car company, Waymo, which has recently been embroiled in legal and technological battles with Uber as both companies pursue similar automated-chauffeur services. Page didn't mention Waymo's competition but shared his excitement about its eventual launch. Here's Page's full letter to Alphabet shareholders: "A is for Alphabet" Hard to believe we are about a quarter short of two years of announcing Alphabet. It's been busy! I certainly feel Alphabet is working well, and as intended (see the original "G is for Google" announcement). At the time, I wrote that "Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence." The new structure has helped entrepreneurs build and run companies with the autonomy and speed they need. Sergey and I are working well together on the overall Alphabet direction and providing guidance to the companies. Sundar is doing great as Google CEO. It's certainly a big job and we are very lucky to have him. He'll probably write this letter again in the future as he has in the past, so I won't speak too much for him on the Google related topics in this one. But, I'm excited about how he is leading the company with a focus on machine learning and AI. We took a big step in that direction with the Google Assistant, and built it into a new family of hardware devices like the Pixel and Google Home. There's a lot more to come. We've had a number of significant things happen on the Alphabet side since I last wrote. A number of our projects became companies, with more autonomy and dedicated leadership. Waymo is the new self-driving car company formed from Project Chauffeur at X. John Krafcik is the new CEO and brings significant auto industry experience. I love the name and I love even more the excitement you can see when you visit with them! They also formed a partnership with Fiat Chrysler around their new plug-in hybrid Pacifica minivan which I see driving around the Waymo offices with lots of sensors on it. I can't wait until Waymo launches. Verily Life Sciences launched in December 2015 with Andy Conrad as founding CEO, also coming out of X. They have launched myriad efforts and raised $800M from Temasek, who joined their board and will help with Asian expansion. I'm very fond of their Debug project, which aims to stop mosquitoes in their tracks. It has been running for a while, showing some good foresight because it was started before Zika became a big concern. In June 2016, Marwan Fawaz became CEO of Nest. He has been doing great against their plan, and we have really been enjoying working with him! I recommend you buy all their excellent products including indoor and outdoor cameras, learning thermostats, and smoke alarms. Very recently Greg McCray started as CEO of Google Fiber. I've been enjoying working with him and his team and he has rapidly been getting up to speed. He visited all of our Fiber cities so quickly that I think he was still a bit out of breath when he got back to Mountain View! We have made significant investments in bringing gigabit fiber internet to lots of happy customers and I'm excited about our opportunities to do it better. We have many other efforts within Alphabet. Calico CEO Art Levinson, former CEO of Genentech, is building an amazing research and development company focused on aging. We also have newly branded investment arms, GV (formerly Google Ventures), and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) which are doing well. Sergey is continuing to spend time working with the X moonshot factory. They have a number of efforts like Wing, which is doing drone delivery. I also can't wait for them to launch! With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility. We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success. Our recent launch of Waymo was a great example of our learnings. In general we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We're not going to invest if we don't see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good. Machine learning and all the efforts around Google Brain and Deepmind are good examples. Google Cloud led by Diane Greene is doing a fabulous job of getting our machine learning hardware and software out to everyone. We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out. Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more. So in conclusion, Sergey and I are having a good time looking for new opportunities and managing and scaling our existing efforts. I still see amazing opportunities that just aren't quite fully developed yet—and helping making them real is what I get excited about. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Now anyone can create a Google Classroom Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/27 6:45am PDTApr 27, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares226 Applications Downloads News Last month it was announced that Google Classroom would be opened up to anyone with a Google account — the collaboration tool for education was limited to those with a G Suite account, previously. That change meant that normal users could join classrooms, but now Google is expanding the functionality and allowing anyone to create and manage classrooms, too. According to Google's blog, The Keyword, teachers and students have been testing this new feature for the past few weeks. Google points to 3 specific use cases in its post. The first is an adult course on graphic design using Google Drawings (a good opportunity for cross-promotion there). The second involves after school programs, in this instance a girl scout group dedicated to building robots. And lastly, it talks about a student-run club intended to bring together those wanting to discuss design, art, and programming. It looks like it would be perfect for various adult education programs not affiliated with a school and it's great to see Google making these types of educational resources available to more and more people.

Shining Wing It was already G Suite-only before this change. Your jokes are terrible. Grey Hopefully this means more things will be coming to all users from G-Suite. I'm talking about the new Hangouts. Plain Hangouts both badly needs modern features and is only modern features away from being recommendable to everyone. Plus instead of simply playing catch-up it adds new and interesting features and connectivity to other Google apps - plus a sweet video call meeting feature that everyone could take advantage of. It's a no brainer. I hope they announce it next month. Derik Taylor This could be interesting. I have been considering getting with a group of people for study days for various topics, but have no idea how Google Classroom works. Interested to try it out. NunjaBusiness "or take a look online, to see if there's anything interesting you'd like to learn." Umm, yeah, the first thing I'd like to learn is how to find a list of classes available. You didn't seem to manage to do that in your little write-up. Fargo_Zoidberg Angry! Midnitte Seems like it could be useful for MOOCs Pedro Majano I think this kind of topic does not belong to an android blog... unless all of your target audience has GSuite for Education and are Teachers and Admin console users... Just saying. But lets see the comments. Zouz Dude, it's available to anyone with a simple Gmail account, did you read the article ? Pedro Majano LOL marcusmarcus2 Also, the article has a link to the playstore for the android app for this. So yeah, completely reasonable to be in an Android blog. Pedro Majano I could swear i saw "Not" instead of "Now", but I got coffee now, sorry bout that! 4Ui812 Now anyone can show Google how to properly check for software bugs prior to release. Atleast that's how I read the headline :-) Lee I've been wishing for a long time to use this system for teaching Japanese online. I'm curious to see if I can truly use this tool for tutoring. Grant Phillips-Sewell Works for Gmail accounts. Weeks due GSuite for Education accounts. Does not seem to work with other types of GSuite admits. *sadface* instinct As a teacher, I love Google Classroom. I don't think too many users who are not teachers will want to use it, but I bet there are some user case scenarios that it would be useful for.

Alex Moore Email 00:10 Friday 28 April 2017 0 Have your say Google has chosen Sheffield to be the first UK city to host its high street digital training centre. The Digital Garage will open in Barker's Pool today, offering free digital skills training seven days a week for the next six months. Google's Digital Garage pop-up in Barker's Pool. People will be able to learn everything they need to make the most of online opportunities, from developing their own web presence to growing their business or charity online. Courses will be available, or people can just pop in for free advice. Google EMEA's vice president of marketing Torsten Schuppe said: "In the digital age, a basic understanding of how the online world works is useful; and when it comes to business, it’s essential. "We are here to ensure everyone in Sheffield has access to the best free training and advice and are particularly excited to open the first ever Google digital skills training centre on a British high street right here in the Sheffield city centre. "This will make it even easier for you to just pop in and get the skills you need to find opportunities to excel in what matters most to you, grow your business, or launch the next big idea." According to the British Chambers of Commerce, more than 90 per cent of jobs will require digital literacy in the near future. But 76 per cent of UK firms say they have a shortage of digital skills in their workforce. This can be due to a lack of time for staff training, the high cost of training or the difficulty in developing the right skills. Director of city growth at Sheffield Council Edward Highfield said: “We are delighted to welcome Google’s Digital Garage to Sheffield, a fantastic addition to the heart of our city centre. "We know there is still more to be done to empower people to use the internet and tackle the issues that prevent people from engaging with rapidly changing digital culture. "We encourage everyone to take full advantage of this unique opportunity, and look forward to seeing how Google can build even further on Sheffield’s reputation for growth, innovation and business success.” And Louise Haigh, shadow digital economy minister and Labour's candidate for Sheffield Heely, said: "This is a major coup for Sheffield. "With investment in the city centre and major businesses choosing to make Sheffield home, now could not be a better time for the leading digital business on the planet to come. "Too many small businesses lack the digital skills needed to unlock growth because the training isn’t available. Bringing Google’s experts to Sheffield will change that and thousands of businesses will benefit during their stay. "With our world-leading video games industry our ambition should be to make Sheffield the UK’s digital centre which will bring with it high-paid jobs for local people."

An uproar that began with hate speech on YouTube was quelled only after a major charm offensive by Google. The Internet giant was forced to make an all-out public relations push in recent weeks to reassure big advertisers after some well-known brands had their ads placed next to objectionable content on its video service, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said late Thursday. In an effort led by chief business officer Phillip Schindler, the company reached out to calm "thousands and thousands" of YouTube clients nervous that their brands might be next to suffer the same embarrassment, Pichai said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts after the company's Q2 earnings report on Thursday. The effort came after a slew of well-known brands, including McDonald's, Audi and AT&T, said they would temporarily suspend advertising on YouTube after the Times of London discovered ads placed next to racist, sexist and xenophobic content. The uproar caused at least one financial analyst to downgrade the company's shares. While the ad boycott failed to dent the near-term business of Google parent Alphabet, which reported first-quarter sales and profit that topped Wall Street estimates, it took a lot of effort to quell. "I would estimate Phillip Schindler's team made literally thousands and thousands of calls...an in-person conversations," Pichai said in response to a question on the call. The end result for YouTube and Google is that "we're evolving overall to a better place," according to Pichai, adding that "the feedback from our partners was very positive and constructive."

Amazon saw a huge profit jump and beat the Street's earnings estimates by 40 cents while Alphabet's sales surged 22 percent, promising signs for both of the tech giants. The "Mad Money" host is confident the two can continue to outshine less favorable market trends like the decline of oil prices. "If oil goes down tomorrow, you will likely see these two buck the trend. In other words, Amazon goes up even if retailers were down, which they were, and Google goes up. Well, let's just say it looks like they just have increasing business in many different elements, not just search," Cramer said. Getty Images A floorhand works on an oil rig in the Bakken shale formation outside Watford City, North Dakota. But as the prices of other energy fuels rise, one electric utility CEO told Cramer on Thursday that the energy sector is not as bad as it appears to some on the Street. In reality, it is just evolving. "You're seeing a massive shift to a more balanced energy portfolio, so you're going to see natural gas continue to pick up because it's less carbon than coal, about half the emissions of carbon from coal, and then, as well, moving to renewables and other types of applications on the grid," Nick Akins, president, chairman and CEO of American Electric Power. With oil and gas extraction up 16 percent year over year, Akins said that there is little for investors to worry about when it comes to the health of the industrial sector, especially given the Trump administration's focus on building pipelines, creating jobs, and boosting the coal sector. "Transmission is a key optimizer, so you're going to see all those resources continue to branch out, and it'll reduce carbon emissions significantly," he told Cramer. Pau Barrena | Bloomberg | Getty Images Dan Schulman, president and chief executive officer of PayPal As the onslaught of earnings continues, Cramer turned to two tech players that reported after Wednesday's bell to analyze the possible winners of one of earnings season's busiest days. "When I look at ServiceNow, the cloud-based software company ... that's literally replacing outdated patterns of work, particularly involving crucial customer service or hard-to-manage but consistent problems of human resources, I can make a strong case that that won the night," the "Mad Money" host said. But ServiceNow had a formidable challenger. Online payment company PayPal delivered a stellar report, with 6 million new customers, bringing its total to over 203 million accounts. "That's PayPal's best organic growth in three years, showing a phenomenal acceleration in this hugely important key metric," Cramer said, adding that Venmo, PayPal's millennial-friendly peer-to-peer cash delivery app, saw a 114 percent increase in growth. To settle the debate, Cramer turned to ServiceNow President and CEO John Donahoe for some context on how the software player is growing and expanding beyond its original means. "Not only are we delivering an information technology, which has been our historical sweet spot, but increasingly, they're pulling our platform into other areas that cut across the enterprise," Donahoe told Cramer on Thursday. Other areas include security, customer support, and information technology service management. Donahoe said the company's ultimate aim is to "simplify, streamline, and automate" complex services for employees that take up time and money, like onboarding new hires. "I was able to onboard in less than half a day, all through self-service, and that's the kind of way ServiceNow is being pulled into some of these experiences that cut across multiple departments of a company," Donahoe said of his own experience at ServiceNow.

"Ultimately, that means that you're going to be generating a better return, that means your cost of capital goes down, that means you can make more investments in the business, so it's a positive overall," the CEO told Cramer on Thursday. Though Doyle did not disclose specifics on how Domino's might spend the extra capital, he said one of his main priorities would be to reinvest in his fast-growing business. "Nobody's ever given a special deal for pizza or restaurants," Doyle said. "Corporate tax rate goes down, then you're definitely going to see even more investment." In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Duluth Holdings: "You know, I like the clothes, but the stock itself, you know I'm not a big apparel fan. Now, you happened to have that nice bounce in Under Armour today because estimates have been cut and cut and cut and cut and cut. Duluth, I don't know. I could do without it, frankly." Hawaiian Holdings: "I like HA very much, but I interviewed Gary Kelly this morning when we were on 'Squawk on the Street' and I think that Southwest Air is ready for a real takeoff."

We could choose who we wanted to focus on during that era, and me specifically, I chose Hercules Mulligan, who was a spy for George Washington,” said Deon Myles, 16, a student at Air Force High School. “I’m so excited. I can’t wait to see the play. My mother went, and she was so happy I was going to get this opportunity.” During their study, Google Goggles had taken these students back in history, virtually placing them in the middle of the fermenting American Revolution, for example, or on the scene of the action-packed Hamilton-Burr duel. And on Wednesday, they weren’t just going to see the popular, hip-hop musical. They were going to turn the tables on its lauded cast. The students spent the morning performing on the Hamilton stage for the cast, with their own versions of scenes from the play. They would rap. They would sing. They would recite. They would debate. And the cast would be in awe. Hamilton Chicago | Provided photo They’d say as much in a Q and A session with the students afterward, before retiring to prepare for an afternoon matinee performance for the students. “When they gave us the curriculum packet, we did it in class, and then we were supposed to come up with like a skit,” said Winter Smith, a sophomore at Phoenix Military Academy, who performed a rap about the Boston Tea Party, one of 12 student performances. “I wrote that rap in like 15 minutes, and actually, I wasn’t that nervous,” she said. “When I performed it at school, I was nervous, because my peers made it worse than it really was. But in front of this huge audience today, I was actually like, ‘OK, I can do this.’ I honestly never heard about Hamilton until we started doing the work in class and stuff. I thought it was really cool how he strived to do a lot, persevered and achieved it.” Hamilton | Provided photo Twenty-two schools were represented. Google said it developed the Hamilton virtual reality tools last month because the groundbreaking play converges with Google’s mission. “We really respect how Hamilton is using information, and telling it in a new way, and that inspired Google to get involved,” said Google Midwest spokesman Rob Biederman. “Google’s mission is to really make information accessible and useful, And that’s our connection to Hamilton. They’re really telling important American stories in an accessible, new innovative way that really relates to these students, and we wanted to make it more of an inclusive experience for students,” he said. “We’ve been working on the VR [Virtual reality] tools a long time, but within the last month is when we developed the Hamilton one. It’s brand new.” Dwight Strong, a junior at Noble Street Charter school, performed a poem he’d written about the Boston Massacre. “It was one of the key events that led to the American Revolution. It was like the colonists were protesting against the British, because the rules that they enforced were unfair, and they wanted to change the policy. That’s when they began to protest, and things turned bad,” Strong said. “It reminded me of today’s protests over victims of police brutality,” he said. “This is my first time actually going to a big play like this. So it’s very exciting, and it’s fun, and just a lot of emotions. When I heard I was going to be performing in front of 2,000 people, I was like, ‘Whoa. That’s kind of intimidating.’ I was nervous, but I managed to get through it.” And during the play, all you saw were wide eyes, glued and attentive — no fidgeting — and of course, lots of applause and laughter. But hear it from these newest theater critics. “I really loved this show,” said Ashley Gary, a student at Chicago Bulls College Prep. “I loved the different scenes. It definitely kept me interested.” Arrielle Hobson, a student at Chicago Technology Academy, agreed. “It was really entertaining. I didn’t expect it to be that upbeat. Usually when you see plays, they’re not understandable, and they don’t use like catchy rhythms, but this play did a great job of that,” Hobson said.

Twitter Facebook Google Cloud growth is outpacing the company's ad business Turns out, the company's enterprise push is working out IDG Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 28 April, 2017 08:07 - - - - print email Comments Google is still an advertising company, but the tech titan’s cloud business is growing faster than its advertising revenue. That’s one of the key take-aways from the company’s first quarter earnings report released Thursday. Google Cloud Platform is one of the fastest-growing lines of revenue across Alphabet, the parent company that includes Google and other businesses like self-driving car maker Waymo, company CFO Ruth Porat said on a conference call with analysts. That growth is driven in part by a change in the way companies are working with Google Cloud. “Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane [Greene] and her team are having with customers,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said. “Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business.” Blair Hanley Frank Diane Greene, the senior vice president of Google Cloud, speaks at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco on March 8, 2017. Google doesn't break out its Cloud revenue, but groups it with sales of hardware and Google Play in its "Other" segment. Revenue in those businesses totaled almost $3.1 billion during the first three months of 2017, up 49 percent from the same period a year ago. While the precise Cloud share isn't clear, it seems like a significant driver of revenue given how effusive Porat and Pichai were about it on the call. The growth in the Other segment well outpaced Google’s ad revenue, which rose 19 percent year over year to $21.4 billion. The advertising division’s year-over-year growth rate has remained fairly constant over the past year, while Other has been accelerating during the same period. Urs Hölzle, Google’s infrastructure czar, has said in the past that he expects the cloud business to outpace Google’s ad revenue in the future, and the results announced Thursday show it trending in that direction, although it has some way to go. In addition to its revenue growth, Google is also pouring money into the Cloud team. The plurality of new hires in the past quarter were brought into the Cloud team, which was also the beneficiary of the most Google capital expenditures over that same period, Porat said. Those metrics are another sign of the company’s commitment to its cloud platform. While the revenue growth announced Thursday shows that Google’s cloud offerings are on the rise, GCP and G Suite remain underdogs in their respective markets. For example, Amazon Web Services’ revenue for the first quarter was more than $3.6 billion, dwarfing the entire Google Other segment’s quarterly revenue. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

It’s not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service — one that could undercut Google’s growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet’s first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn’t start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. Latest business videos The company’s earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday’s extended trading. But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. “There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person,” says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. “They don’t want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don’t have to because they have many other choices.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had “thousands and thousands” of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. “We are evolving overall to a better place,” Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing “extraordinary” growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won’t leave a huge dent in Alphabet’s earnings. That’s because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company’s golden goose — Google’s dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet’s revenue even as it expands into other fields. But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. Before the boycott began, YouTube’s ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn’t disclose YouTube’s finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after the Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn’t have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. “This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand,” says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Walmart, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson and Volkswagen. It’s unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told the Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn’t advertising on YouTube, either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn’t respond. Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. “It’s going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away,” he said. “There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term.” Investors, however, apparently aren’t too worried so far. YouTube’s financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google’s ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet’s net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

What does that mean for average consumers like you and I? Not much at this time, but it most definitely will a little later down the road. With the release of this SDK preview, developers can begin to build integration between their hardware and Google’s digital assistant. Google highlights someone could create a robot with Assistant built in or even a voice-enabled smart mirror. The possibilities go on and on. Here’s a bit more technical of a description for what this SDK includes, courtesy of Google. The Google Assistant SDK includes a gRPC API, a Python open source client that handles authentication and access to the API, samples and documentation. The SDK allows you to capture a spoken query, for example “what’s on my calendar”, pass that up to the Google Assistant service and receive an audio response. And while it’s ideal for prototyping on Raspberry Pi devices, it also adds support for many other platforms. If you’re a developer, go get started.

"For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising."Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday.Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc (FB.O), Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Wall Street grew anxious as a series of high-profile advertisers fled YouTube amid concerns about ads appearing alongside extremist content. But Google's results showed that controversy was little more than a speed bump for the company as revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (bit.ly/2qbMJGY)"YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising," Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during an earnings call. Analysts marveled at the company's ability to continue to post sizeable year-over-year gains from such a large base.Google's ad revenue, which accounts for the lion's share of its business, rose 18.8 percent to $21.41 billion in the first quarter. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount.With the traditional business of search advertising maturing, the company is looking to YouTube as its next driver of growth.The strong results also allayed concerns about a recent controversy surrounding the video service and its impact on Google's ad revenue. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service.“Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. Alphabet is also reaping the benefits of investing heavily in areas such as hardware and cloud.Revenue from its Google Other unit, which includes Pixel smartphone, Play Store and cloud business, rose 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion.Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier.Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

By Steven Overly / The Washington Post The embattled leader of Uber’s self-driving car program stepped out of that role on Thursday, the latest development in a trade secret dispute between two of the industry’s leading players. Anthony Levandowski has emerged as a central figure in the legal battle between Uber and Waymo, Google’s driverless car initiative. A former Google employee, Mr. Levandowski is accused of stealing 14,000 documents that contained technology designs before leaving the company last year to start his own self-driving venture. That company, called Otto, was acquired by Uber in a matter of months. Waymo filed suit against Uber claiming the ride-sharing company’s technology is based, at least in part, on the stolen information. The company is also seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Uber from using the disputed technology until the case is resolved. A hearing on that injunction is scheduled for May 3 in San Francisco. Earlier this month, Judge William Alsup threatened to bar Mr. Levandowski from working on the company’s autonomous cars if he and Uber did not more fully investigate Waymo’s accusations. Mr. Levandowski will be replaced by Eric Meyhofer, according to a staff email. Mr. Meyhofer oversees development of the company’s light detection and ranging, or LiDAR, technology, which serves as the vehicle’s eyes on the road. Mr. Levandowski will stay with Uber and maintain his other responsibilities. In the email, he sought to distance himself from the company’s LiDAR development, stating that he does not currently “provide input on detailed LiDAR design choices.” “We should all be proud that our self-driving technology has been built independently, from the ground up,” Mr. Levandowski wrote in the email. Attorneys for Mr. Levandowski did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An Uber spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the email, which was first obtained by Business Insider, but did not comment further. Here is the email in full. Team: I want to let you know that Travis and I have decided that I will be recused from all LiDAR-related work and management at Uber, through the remainder of the Waymo litigation. This change means that Eric Meyhofer will be the head of ATG, reporting to Travis, and I will report to Eric. My other responsibilities will not change. As you know, I currently don’t provide input on detailed LiDAR design choices. But making this organizational change means I will have absolutely no oversight over or input into our LiDAR work. Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic. We all know the hard work that Eric, James and the LiDAR team have put into independently developing our technology over the past few years. We should all be proud that our self-driving technology has been built independently, from the ground up. With this move, I hope to keep the team focused on achieving the vision that brought us all here.

This journalistic investigation is directly related to the interview given to Rough&Polished by World of Diamonds, and we strongly recommend reading both texts to have a complete impression. An opportunity to conduct journalistic investigation is a rare stroke of luck in the work of any journalist. People engaged in illegal activities usually behave very carefully, and to detect them is a big problem. Nevertheless, sometimes even scammers make a blunder. As a rule, they are let down either by greed and thirst for glory, or by pathological confidence in the stupidity of others. Today we will show you just such a case. There are many diamond mining companies in the world. There are companies operating in Canada and Russia, in Africa and Australia. There are public companies that are traded on the stock exchange, and there are small-scale artisanal miners, who are panning gravel for diamonds using iron sieves. There are companies that comply with all the trade rules, and there are companies that violate the requirements of the Kimberley Process. But we were lucky to discover a completely new kind of diamond mining company, and we are proud to present it to you. Ladies and gentlemen, meet a virtual miner. World of Diamonds led by Mr. Karan Tilani is the owner of a very large, but, unfortunately, non-existent diamond field in Russia. We first discovered the website of this company last year, but at the time did not pay much attention to it, considering it an inept joke. However, it was sheer underestimation on our part: as it turns out the ‘joke’ has acquired an unprecedented sway in recent months. In April, several trading companies received “business propositions” from World of Diamonds - obviously, they were offered “stones” from that non-existent diamond field. And the company itself has given a dozen interviews in recent months, including the proposal to give an interview to Rough&Polished. We consider it our duty to warn the market about this questionable activity. It's terrible to think how many illegal deals can be pulled off under the cover of a website describing non-existent projects and hiding behind a large number of laudatory publications in the media. Below is a long enough narrative with a number of screenshots. We have checked all the information about World of Diamonds that we could find - from the photos on their website to the incorporation data on legal entities in this country, and tried to make our explanations as detailed as possible, so as not to leave any doubts. Part 1. Photoshop and plagiarism. Formerly, in order to position oneself as a solid company, it was necessary to rent an office and at least hire a secretary to answer phone calls and give smiles to people at the reception. Times have changed, and today any acquaintance with a company begins with its website. Well, it's even convenient: one may avoid spending money on renting an office and just upload a few webpages with photos, thus turning a businessperson. There is one stumbling block on this way, however: if you are making a website of a production company, you have to show photos of its assets. But such a delicate situation can be circumvented. This is the picture we see on the main page of World of Diamonds’ website. It depicts the "Tarskaya mine," which WOD calls its main asset. Impressive, isn’t it? It is immediately evident that you are dealing with serious people having rich experience in mining. Source: The "official" website of World of Diamonds. You bet! The experience of the miners at this mine is really rich, because in fact the photo shows the Diavik diamond field in Canada, which is being developed by Dominion Diamonds. Dear Dominion staff, how do you like the news that you, as it turns out, are working in Russia? Or the news that someone is misusing your photos? In this photo, you see the Diavik open-pit mines. Let’s take another photo from the WOD website - this time, it is obviously depicting a workers village or something like that. Source: The "official" website of World of Diamonds. Unlike the diamond field, the village on the photograph cannot be identified by eye. All workers settlements are similar to each other. But for such situations, major search engines (including Google, to whose "services" we have resorted) have introduced an image search. You upload a picture and immediately see where it was published before and to whom it belongs. And this workers village belongs ...   ... belongs to a well-known photobank, which sells stock photos for money. By the way, the photo is not at all related to diamond mining, depicting just the "exterior of a plant". Let's try one more photo. Here, apparently, we are shown the process of mining diamond ore at the Tarskaya mine. Source: The “official” website of World of Diamonds. Whereas Google is somehow convinced that this photo belongs to Phillips & Stevens, a Canada-based land surveying company. Shall we have another try? This is also a photo of an operating production asset belonging to WOD. Source: The "official" website of World of Diamonds. Or not to WOD? World of Diamonds has many beautiful photos. I especially like this one. Source: The "official" website of World of Diamonds. I hope all readers understand that this image is not real, as it is only the result of Photoshop witchcraft. However, it is an instance of quite mediocre witchcraft, I should say - many high school students would have coped better. To start with, the open pit (which, it would seem, is in the foreground) is disproportionately small in comparison with the buildings that are seen in the distance. Never mind the buildings – it does not match the bushes, which are supposedly growing on its sides! These growing bushes are higher than the height of one tier of the spiral road inside the open pit. And the dumper creeping up the road is exactly the size of an ant. However, we should not find fault with the buildings - they are not real and are cut from some other photos. Actually, the only thing that exists on the original image is the hill, snow-covered grass and the house on the right side. All the rest is carefully added by the hands of a novice photoshopper from Latvia (yes, you can also get a country record from the source file). Gentlemen, if you paid him money for his work, then you spent it for naught. In general, we tried very hard to find at least one real-production photo on the World of Diamonds website. We tried indeed, but could not. All of them are either stolen from other diamond mining companies or taken from publicly available photobanks. Part 2. The non-existent mine. However, the use of other people's photos does not prove anything by itself. No one knows, but what if the website of World of Diamonds is simply maintained by lazy and incompetent contractors? Instead of using original images on this website, they did not bother much and stole photos from the Internet. This, unfortunately, also happens. To accuse people of fraud, one should have more substantial arguments. According to the information on the website of World of Diamonds and in their interviews, the company's main activity is carried on in the Srednekansky District of the Magadan Oblast (Magadan Region) in Russia. According to World of Diamonds, they have here the Tarskaya diamond mine, which was discovered in 2006 and is being developed since 2010. There are 6 kimberlite pipes (out of the existing 38!!!) with open pits dug to the depth of 100-490 meters, from which the company has already extracted 18.7 million tons of ore yielding about 35.4 million carats of diamonds, the WOD website says. Let's start with a simple thing, typing in Russian “полезные ископаемые Магаданской области” (which stands for "minerals of the Magadan Oblast") in the search bar. This is a truly resource-rich area. According to the official information on the website of the Magadan Oblast government, there are "reserves of gold, silver, tin, coal, molybdenum, cobalt, tungsten, lead and zinc along with significant manifestations of copper and iron." There is not a word about diamonds in this long list. In their interviews, the representatives of World of Diamonds often repeat that typical of Russian companies, the Group has not sought public exposure. This is an excellent argument for throwing dust in the eyes of foreigners, but, unfortunately, it does not correspond to reality. Despite the fact that many people abroad consider the Russian market closed and not completely civilized, in practice it is quite transparent. Under Russian laws, it is impossible to conduct any kind of business activity in this country without being registered with appropriate official agencies and without disclosing information about such activity. If, of course, we are talking about legal activity, and not about a criminal group. It is especially true for diamonds. In Russia, it is impossible to own diamond deposits (the more so, large ones) without anyone knowing about it. The Russian Federal Agency for Subsoil Use (Rosnedra) regularly publishes and updates the list of subsoil plots of federal significance (which include all diamond deposits). In the list containing 373 items, there is not a single deposit, site or anomaly named "Tarskaya" (“Тарская” in Russian) or any of its variations. Moreover, there are only 5 sites in the Magadan Oblast having the status of "federal subsoil plots" and all of them are gold bearing. The list of Rosnedra does not contain a single diamond manifestation in the territory of the Magadan Oblast. To make the picture complete, let's turn to the well-known service of Google Maps. This is how the Nyurbinskaya and Botuobinskaya diamond pipes developed by ALROSA in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) look from above. Purposefully, we did not take huge diamond mines like Mir and Udachny for this demonstration. The Nyurbinskaya diamond pipes are much smaller in size, but they are still clearly visible. Looking from the satellite, it is difficult to confuse a diamond pipe with something else. And now using the Google Maps service, let's have a look at the Srednekansky District of the Magadan Oblast. Specifically, lets us inspect the right bank of the Kolyma River in the place where it turns to the left - it is exactly there, where, according to the map on the WOD website, there are “6 kimberlite pipes” of the Tarskaya diamond field. There is nothing like a diamond open pit. The area is dotted with mountains and does not give any indication of the ongoing mining of minerals. Any reader can easily open Google Maps and scrutinize the whole Srednekansky District and even the entire Magadan Oblast - and will fail to find there anything like a diamond mining operation. For those who have any doubts, we would like to bring to their notice the following. In response to the request from Rough&Polished, Liliya Lazareva (Лилия Лазарева), the official spokesperson of the Magadan Oblast Government said that the authorities of this region "do not know such an enterprise” and added that “diamonds in the Magadan Oblast have never been mined." You are free to draw your conclusions yourself. Those for whom words are not enough may be convinced by numbers. In their interview, WOD claim that they produce about 7 million carats of diamonds annually. According to the Ministry of Finance of Russia (which oversees the country's diamond industry), the country produced 41.9 million carats of diamonds in 2015 and a similar figure is given in the Kimberley Process report. Of this volume, ALROSA produced 38.3 million carats and Grib Diamonds about 2 million carats. And where are the "7 million carats" produced by WOD? Part 3. " The Boss of It All." Honestly, until the last moment we cherished a hope that an interview with World of Diamonds would clarify something. Despite the obvious facts, it was difficult enough to realize that right under the nose of everybody there is an evident forgery, which for some reason no one sees. We believed that we could communicate live with someone from WOD’s management and understand the essence of this company’s business. Instead of communicating live with their CEO, our correspondent received written answers to her questions. And a photo of Boris Voronov, CEO of World of Diamonds. Here it is: In fact, even with the naked eye you can see that something is wrong with this photograph. The strange blurred background making your dizzy and a very sharp, contrasting figure on it with a strange face whose right side is shaved and the left side is not. But let's refrain from guessing about the man’s appearance. For such cases, there is the Error Level Analysis (ELA) of photographs. This program analyzes the areas with different compression levels on the photo and based on this draws a conclusion about whether any sections of the photo were added new elements or edited. This is a very convenient service, recently gaining momentum to combat fake news. The results of Error Level Analysis can be seen here. Judging by the analysis, the man’s figure is inserted into the photo of the interior, and the figure itself was also subjected to a significant correction – its entire face (especially the eyes), neck, tie and the contour of hands were edited. And if you turn to the already familiar search for the original source of photo in Google, you can find the man himself. Meet Patrick Mathiew, CEO of Armacell. Only for the photo in the interior of the World of Diamonds, they gave him other eyes (without much respect for the proportions and their arrangement on the face), edited his mouth (finally spoiling the location of shadows in the photo), inserted another tie, and at the same time drew new hands, since the original was only a chest photo. Incidentally, the fact that the hands are "borrowed," is very noticeable in the photo: the color of the skin on these hands is much darker compared with the face color. So, for the publication of their interview World of Diamonds provided a photograph of a non-existent person, saying it was their CEO. I have exactly two options: either Chief Executive Officer Boris Voronov is hiding and does not want to be photographed, or Boris Voronov, CEO of World of Diamonds does not exist in this world at all. This caused big questions about the management of World of Diamonds. We checked all the people listed on the company's website in the sections "Senior Management" and "Board of Directors". None of them has profiles in social networks or LinkedIn. Which is strange in itself - if they are such well-known professionals in their field, as it is described on the WOD website, why are they not known to anyone and do not have a network of business contacts? We also checked all these people through the SPARK system (Russia's integrated data base on legal entities and their management) and did not find any of them mentioned on the WOD website. The only coincidence was Sergey Anosov (he is listed as a member of the board of directors of WOD). However, we cannot be sure that we found the right Sergey Anosov and not his namesake (there is no data on his birth or patronymic on the WOD website). But if we are not mistaken, and this is the right person, the result will surprise you. The individual entrepreneur, as well as OOO TZK incorporated under the name of Sergey Anosov do have licenses for the trade in diamonds and precious stones, their processing, production and sale of jewelry. And in general, Sergey Valentinovich Anosov is mentioned in an unofficial (and sarcastic) "Rating of Russia's Greatest Entrepreneurs" as a man who established about 300 shell companies and was the CEO of more than 150 of them. At the same time, we also checked ООО «Мир Бриллиантов», which WOD mentioned in an interview with Rough&Polished. According to Boris Voronov (it is hard to say to what extent you can believe a person existing as a drawing), ООО «Мир Бриллиантов» was established in 2001 and is the backbone of the whole World of Diamonds Group. Unfortunately, the SPARK database has pay access, so instead of a link, we have to submit a screenshot. According to Russia’s integrated register of legal entities, there is only one company bearing the name of ООО «Мир Бриллиантов» in this country. It was incorporated in 2013 and not in 2001. Its CEO is not Boris Voronov, but Roman Murashov (though, most likely, he is also a "dummy," because under his name, besides this company, there are incorporated a dozen of others selling everything from construction materials to bed-clothes). The company is said to have a staff of up to 5 people (and what about the 9,000 employees mentioned on the World of Diamonds website??) and the authorized capital of 100,000 rubles (which is the average salary of one resident of the Magadan Oblast for 2 months). Eventually, we could find neither any real legal entity, nor almost anyone of the World of Diamonds’ management. Almost nobody, except one person. This person is called Karan Tilani. On the WOD website, he is named the head of the company for the Asian market, while in social networks and LinkedIn, he is mentioned as the director of the entire World of Diamonds Group. He is the only person whose photos can be found on the Internet in publications about WOD (and he is indeed often photographed). Actually, a letter asking for an interview came to us on behalf of his assistant, Elena Garbellini (who, judging by LinkedIn, lives in Romania, and not in Russia or any other "diamond" country). By the way, the request from the "Russian" company for this interview was not directed to the Moscow office of Rough&Polished, but to our correspondent in India. Lars von Trier has a wonderful comedy, "The Boss of It All." In it, a flaccid business owner comes up with an imaginary "big boss from America" in order to dump all unpopular decisions on him and thus avoid unpleasant conversations with employees and eventually any responsibility for his own actions. On behalf of this ghostly boss, he fired people, made deals, and even corresponded with counterparts. I have a big suspicion that World of Diamonds does not just resort to a similar scheme, but even improved it. Why conduct real business, if you can invent a diamond mine in a far-away place of snowy Russia, about which no one knows anything? For greater substantiality, it is possible to invent a row of "directors", and even give interviews on their behalf in various publications. And all this is quite easy to do alone, or well, with the help of a very small group of people. Part 4. Creating added value In their numerous interviews, World of Diamonds and Karan Tilani emerge before us as ambassadors of the world of luxury, and I would even say, "extra-luxury." For example, they are widely promoting a swizzle stick graced with diamonds worth $ 1 million - but it will only go to someone ready to buy from their partner, Dreammaker, an exclusive expensive travel tour for $ 14 million. Another project is a ring with a blue diamond worth $ 2 million, named after actress Jane Seymour - which, however, is not sold separately, but is included in the "most expensive dinner in the world." In all these projects, WOD appears as the company that extracted those diamonds, cut them and set them in jewelry pieces. And its representatives in all their interviews say that they try to confine their work to exclusive orders only and never deal with mass retail. We have already found out that World of Diamonds does not mine anything. It remains only to find out what it is trading in. And their interview was really helpful to understand this. Here's what WOD told Rough&Polished about their business activities: “We streamline operations with some of our affiliate companies where the lower value diamonds we mine get manufactured and traded through them, while the higher value diamonds evolving from their mines passes through us. <…> World of Diamonds Group specializes in supplying polished diamonds as we have the capacity and expertise to cut, polish and distribute finished stones. <…> Polishing diamonds are a value added service to our clients, and so we do not have plans to offer rough diamonds.” It is really very convenient to trade polished diamonds, because unlike rough diamonds, polished diamonds do not require a bunch of documents and KP certificates. If you are deft enough, you can buy several polished diamonds in one corner of the globe, and the next day resell them to jewelers in quite another part of the world – this time saying they are your own independently mined product. Do you still have some doubts? But we have a website, and there are publications about our company in the Internet! An article floating on the Internet, too, you know, gives some added value to a diamond. Nevertheless, if you position yourself as a Russian diamond mining company, you will probably need to have some quantity of Russian rough diamonds with KP certificates stating that the "country of their origin is Russia" - just to show them to your counterparts for more authenticity. And if you do not have your own mining operation, then you will have to buy these diamonds somewhere. Do you follow my thought? When our correspondent Aruna Gaitonde sent questions for the interview, she asked only about the company's production activities. However, World of Diamonds, on their own initiative, added another question to the interview, which apparently seemed to them important. This one: "World of Diamonds Group only sought visibility through internationalization in early 2013, about the time Alrosa went public. Both mining consortiums have interests in Africa and WOD Group’s registered entity, OOO «Мир Бриллиантов» takes after the famous “Мир” (Mir) mine owned by Alrosa. WOD Group seems to have resource sharing arrangements with a leading Russian diamond mining company and Russian media noted that some of WOD’s key employees have been spotted at Alrosa’s offices. How is World of Diamonds Group related to Alrosa?" As a person working in the “Russian media,” I can say with confidence that no one ever wrote about "WOD’s key employees spotted at Alrosa’s offices." It is your egotism that betrays you, gentlemen: even with all their interest to Alrosa, Russian media do not keep vigil at the door to the office of this company, looking out for all visitors. And even more so, a visiting foreigner would not cause any excitement among the local public: overseas customers come to the company every month by hundreds. Nevertheless, World of Diamonds deemed it necessary to mention this and disown any connection with the company, although in previous interviews they never raised this issue. I have only one assumption: it is most likely that quite recently some market stakeholders saw the gentlemen from World of Diamonds at a trading session of ALROSA, buying diamonds. However, if WOD in engaged in reselling rough and polished diamonds produced by ALROSA, this is not the worst option. WOD has time and again repeated that it has "interests in Africa" - and it means that under the guise of diamonds from their Tarskaya mine they can sell, for example, rough coming from Zimbabwe, or some other country that does not comply with the KP requirements at all. And Karan Tilani in his recent interviews spoke very warmly about synthetic diamonds and confirmed that World of Diamonds was producing them as well, although in small volumes. I wonder if the diamond set into the mentioned $2 million ring is natural? One of the market stakeholders told us about his little experience in communicating with World of Diamonds. According to him, the sale offers made by WOD looked, to put it mildly, very strange and questionable for a serious member of the diamond market, and were safely thrown into the basket. However, such an offer to buy an exclusive polished diamond may seem attractive to people who do not understand the market well enough - for example, for novice jewelers or for wealthy people who want to buy an exclusive piece of jewelry. Under the cover of media support, one can sell anything to such people. P.S. While preparing this article, I had to give up journalistic ethics not allowing World of Diamonds to comment on the results of my investigation. First, I am almost sure that they would have answered "there is some mistake", or "we are a small private company, so nobody knows about our business." Secondly and much more importantly, I did not want to scare them away - probably, having received such a request, World of Diamonds would immediately delete their website and hide for a while. However, my task is first of all to warn diamond market players about the danger and show them this danger (by the way, if WOD still decides to delete their website, we have screenshots of its pages). However, we will certainly listen and publish all the arguments of Mr. Tilani in his defense (although something tells me that he will not have any desire to enter into a dialogue). If he wants, Mr. Tilani can even file a claim against Rough&Polished for damaging his business reputation. We will eagerly respond to his offer to meet in court, because according to the laws of this country, the actions of World of Diamonds in terms of "conscious distortion of the truth" are qualified as fraud. P.P.S. Frankly, the current situation turns me into bewilderment and mild horror. Requesting for an interview, World of Diamonds sent a list of publications about their company to Rough&Polished. Among others, this list also mentions large and usually trustworthy media, like Forbes, Mining Global and even some diamond industry portals. According to these media, World of Diamonds is "one of the world’s largest privately held diamond corporations." Dear journalists, what's the matter with you? Why did it not occur to anyone to check the information on this company? Okay, you do not have correspondents in Russia. But why not send a request to those who work in Russia? Russian media, or at least to the press service of ALROSA, which, perhaps, could give you some answer. It is this journalistic negligence - posting press releases without paying attention to their content or publishing articles for money – that helps people like World of Diamonds to conduct their dishonest business.

The key question is whether a recently launched ad boycott of YouTube turns out to be short-lived or the start of a long-term marketing shift away that undercuts Google’s growth, as well as Alphabet Inc., its corporate parent. SAN FRANCISCO >> YouTube’s inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google’s digital family into a problem child. It’s not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service — one that could undercut Google’s growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet’s first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn’t start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. The company’s earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday’s extended trading. CLOUD OVER YOUTUBE But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. “There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person,” says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. “They don’t want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don’t have to because they have many other choices.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had “thousands and thousands” of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. “We are evolving overall to a better place,” Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing “extraordinary” growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won’t leave a huge dent in Alphabet’s earnings. That’s because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company’s golden goose — Google’s dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet’s revenue even as it expands into other fields. But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. TAKING THE GLOSS OFF Before the boycott began, YouTube’s ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn’t disclose YouTube’s finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn’t have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. “This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand,” says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. FLIGHT OF THE BRANDS At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It’s unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn’t advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn’t respond. TEMPORARY HIT OR PERMANENT SCAR? Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. “It’s going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away,” he said. “There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term.” Investors, however, apparently aren’t too worried so far. YouTube’s financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google’s ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet’s net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

Alphabet reported a 29 per cent jump in quarterly profit to US$5.4 billion, while revenue jumped 22 per cent compared with a year ago to US$24.75 billion. "Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017," chief financial officer Ruth Porat said. "We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet." The Google segment delivered the overwhelming majority of revenues for the company - or US$24.5 billion. The so-called "other bets," which include smart home devices, self-driving cars and life sciences, took in US$244 million in revenue but delivered an operating loss of US$855 million, Alphabet said. Advertisement The stronger-than-expected results helped lift Alphabet shares more than four per cent in after-hours trade on Wall Street. The results did not appear to show a major impact of an ad boycott of Google's YouTube earlier this year after revelations that programmed ads were placed alongside videos showing hateful content. Porat told a conference call that "YouTube revenues continued to grow at a significant rate driven primarily by video advertising." Overall ad revenues for Google rose 19 per cent to US$21.4 billion in the quarter. Google has promised new efforts to match advertisers with appropriate content, using artificial intelligence, in response to complaints. Sundar Pichai, chief of Google, cited "fantastic momentum" for a variety of products including its Google Assistant, the smart home device that competes with Amazon's Alexa-powered speakers. Pichai said the device is one element in a strategy focusing on artificial intelligence, or machine learning. "Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better," he said. A PATIENT APPROACH Company co-founder and chief executive Larry Page said in a letter to shareholders Thursday he is pleased with the direction under the new corporate structure, which separates Google from its "moonshot" operations. "With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility," he wrote. "We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success." Page added that "we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We're not going to invest if we don't see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good." He said the company is benefitting from efforts on artificial intelligence developed by the Google Brain and DeepMind operations. "We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out," he said. "Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more." He said he and co-founder Sergey Brin "are having a good time looking for new opportunities and managing and scaling our existing efforts." Under its new structure, Alphabet is seeking to expand beyond its role as a search engine that provides advertising linked to queries. Last year, Google took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching premium-priced, in-house designed Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess. The group also is selling its Google Assistant which aims to compete with Amazon's Alexa-powered devices as a hub for the smart home, and has been working to become the platform for some connected cars.

An attendee lights up buttons on an interactive panel on the Google stand at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, in March. Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Most Popular After struggling for years to wring profit from the mobile boom, Google is benefiting from a surge in clicks on ads on smartphones. Capitalizing on consumers' shift toward handsets and away from laptops, Google crammed more ads into mobile search results, including new lucrative shopping spots, while running more promotions on its Maps app. The result: Parent Alphabet Inc. beat analysts' sales projections in the first quarter, ending a four-year streak of missing Wall Street estimates after the holidays. Revenue in the quarter, minus payouts to partners, rose to $20.12 billion, above forecasts of $19.76 billion. Net income was $7.73 a share, easily beating analysts' forecasts, helped by cost controls at some of the company's moonshot projects. Alphabet shares closed at a record earlier on Thursday in New York. Related Stories Google Sees Another Chance to Get Programmatic TV Right Along with mobile ads, Alphabet executives cited the growth of YouTube ads as a key driver. Major marketers paused spending recently on the video site over concern about ads running beside offensive content, but that probably had little effect on first-quarter results because it began less than two weeks before the period ended. And the boycott didn't include search ads, the bulk of Google's business. The YouTube ad issue won't impact revenue going forward, according to an executive who spoke after the earnings report. Another factor that investors may cheer came from continued cost controls at Alphabet's most audacious projects. The company cut spending on its Other Bets units -- the non-Google businesses that include its self-driving car company, Waymo. Expenditures on those divisions totaled $170 million during the quarter, down 39% from a year earlier. Alphabet spent more than 14 times that amount on Google. Other Bets operating losses narrowed from the prior quarter, mainly from a pullback by the company's Fiber broadband service. Last year, it dramatically cut back on the once-ambitious effort. On the earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said some Fiber staff were reallocated to Google. In a letter to shareholders before Alphabet's earnings, CEO Larry Page highlighted the recent progress of the self-driving car business, saying he "can't wait until Waymo launches." Page also noted "significant investments" to expand Fiber and expressed excitement about "opportunities to do it better" -- a nod to the efficiency drive at the broadband business. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Digital Video Mobile Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17

Hammons Center in Rogers. Search providers need to “get smarter” about connecting people to information in an accurate and helpful way, said Ben Emmrich, strategic partner developer for Google. He spoke on “reaching today’s customer,” as the keynote speaker at the Trends in Technology Conference on Wednesday (April 26) at the John Q. Hammons Center in Rogers. The event was presented by the University of Arkansas Supply Chain Management Research Center and the Center for Retailing Excellence at the Sam M. Walton College of Business. “The traditional confines of what search means needs to evolve,” he said. “It’s no longer just 10 blue links on a page. It’s no longer 10 blue links, plus five ad links,” he said. Mobile voice searches are a key driver of change. May 2015 was the “tipping point,” Emmrich said, where mobile queries outpaced desktop searches for the first time. Since then, “that trend has only accelerated.” Now, mobile searches make up 60% of internet queries, and many of those are made using voice, he said. “We now see trillions of voice searches per year.” Market researchers predict voice searches will make up about half of searches by 2020. Emmrich said one way search providers can improve is by being “more personable,” understanding the user and his or her environment and how data can be applied in an accurate and helpful way — and helpful means nonintrusive, he said. “Google is now at the cusp of a new frontier for search,” and that future is in Google Assistant, an artificial intelligence-based search platform, and the first device powered by the service, Google Home, Emmrich said. Soon, the service also will be available on Android devices, he said. “You can imagine a world in which your profile with the Google Assistant and with Google products writ large follows you in a helpful way across different devices and platforms, and this shifts toward a more intelligent voice-powered search, where we anticipate users’ needs and can meet them in that moment of need with a quality answer,” Emmrich said. ‘PARADIGM SHIFT’ IN RETAIL INDUSTRY One industry that is going through transition because of mobile technology is shopping, he added. “We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in retail.” He pointed to the Amazon Dash button as an adaption for the changing world. “It’s a great way to reduce friction in a transaction, and it also puts the transaction in context for the user, in the actual place where they use that item,” Emmrich said. He also pointed to subscription services that “reduce friction” and have a model that allows them to offer high-quality items at a lower rate than the market standard. Emmrich said Google is responding with its direct-from-merchant shopping tool, Google Express, which offers same-day, overnight or two-day delivery, depending on where you live. In terms of more forward-thinking technology, virtual and augmented reality are increasingly playing a role in retail. For example, Gap looked at the fact that consumers who tried on clothes in a fitting room were 70% more likely to make purchases and in higher volume, and the retailer is now testing a virtual fitting room app, where customers can choose their size and body type and virtually try on clothes on their smartphone. Emmrich said use of the app has had similar impact on buying frequency to that of in-person dressing room use. GOOGLE’S FUTURE Two products that Google deems as having the potential to be impactful in retail are Purchases on Google and Local Inventory Ads. The company calls Purchases on Google a “transactionable ad unit.” Users have the option to check out within a Google search results or continue to a retailer’s site. Emmrich said while the product is still in its early days, “it is seeing incredibly strong results,” especially with retailers that are having trouble with mobile conversion rates. Also, Emmrich purports that more than half of customers for Purchases on Google are first-time shoppers for those brands. “So, it’s not just a sales driver. It’s a customer driver.” Local Inventory Ads provides geographically specific product information, using both online and offline data, he said. “If you search for ‘headphones near me’ on Google Maps, we would show a store with headphones in stock that we think are relative to that user, direct that user to the store, and then we can then track that on the back-end.” In terms of shopping with Google Assistant, Emmrich said if he was searching for sunglasses to buy, the technology would know that he was between 30 and 40 years old and that he lives in San Francisco and, based on the buying trends of those demographics and other information — like, for example, that he recently returned a pair of Ray-Ban glasses — would make suggestions to help direct his shopping, or put the order through, add it to a shopping list or remind him to make the purchase later. “It would understand the context: where I am, what I’m doing, what I’ve done in the past, so that Google via the assistant can provide relevant and helpful information to help me make the best decision more efficiently,” Emmrich said.

REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo By Julia Love and Rishika Sadam Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc (FB.O), Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. "Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate," dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google's non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. "We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business," Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors' concerns about Google's dependence on search, Wang said. "We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company," he said. "That is quite an impressive achievement." On the other hand, Alphabet's "Other Bets"--separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily--continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down."

That’s one of the key take-aways from the company’s first quarter earnings report released Thursday. Google Cloud Platform is one of the fastest-growing lines of revenue across Alphabet, the parent company that includes Google and other businesses like self-driving car maker Waymo, company CFO Ruth Porat said on a conference call with analysts. That growth is driven in part by a change in the way companies are working with Google Cloud. “Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane [Greene] and her team are having with customers,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said. “Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business.” Blair Hanley Frank Diane Greene, the senior vice president of Google Cloud, speaks at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco on March 8, 2017. Google doesn't break out its Cloud revenue, but groups it with sales of hardware and Google Play in its "Other" segment. Revenue in those businesses totaled almost $3.1 billion during the first three months of 2017, up 49 percent from the same period a year ago. While the precise Cloud share isn't clear, it seems like a significant driver of revenue given how effusive Porat and Pichai were about it on the call. The growth in the Other segment well outpaced Google’s ad revenue, which rose 19 percent year over year to $21.4 billion. The advertising division’s year-over-year growth rate has remained fairly constant over the past year, while Other has been accelerating during the same period. Urs Hölzle, Google’s infrastructure czar, has said in the past that he expects the cloud business to outpace Google’s ad revenue in the future, and the results announced Thursday show it trending in that direction, although it has some way to go. In addition to its revenue growth, Google is also pouring money into the Cloud team. The plurality of new hires in the past quarter were brought into the Cloud team, which was also the beneficiary of the most Google capital expenditures over that same period, Porat said. Those metrics are another sign of the company’s commitment to its cloud platform. While the revenue growth announced Thursday shows that Google’s cloud offerings are on the rise, GCP and G Suite remain underdogs in their respective markets. For example, Amazon Web Services’ revenue for the first quarter was more than $3.6 billion, dwarfing the entire Google Other segment’s quarterly revenue. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The Google Assistant SDK is now publicly available, allows developers to port Assistant to new devices Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:26am PDTApr 27, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 64 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares126 Development Google News Videos One of the reasons Amazon's Alexa assistant has become so popular is because it can be integrated into nearly everything. We've seen phones, speakers, and even refrigerators with Alexa. Now Google is opening up Google Assistant to the same level of accessibility, with the new Google Assistant SDK. With the SDK, developers can integrate Assistant into existing products fairly easily. It remains to be seen how much functionality will be available to third-party devices running Assistant, as it is already fragmented on Google's own devices. But the focus seems to be primarily on voice, not visual displays like Assistant on Android. To make developing easier, the SDK includes the gRPC API, a Python client that handles user authentication and access to the API. This is especially useful if you are trying out the SDK on a Raspberry Pi or similar development board. This first version of the SDK is a Developer Preview, with several features still in development - including hotword support and companion app integration. Google has created a G+ community, a Stack Overflow tag, and a mailing list to help out developers using the SDK. I'm definitely going to try it out myself.

Randroid Looks like I need another Raspberry Pi... Corbin Davenport I haven't actually dug into the SDK yet, but if you don't care about connecting other hardware to Assistant (using the Pi's data pins, for example), I don't see why the Python library wouldn't work on any computer with Python installed. Randroid I'm willing to spend some time tinkering with things. I might put it on the same Pi as my Plex server... maybe I can play things directly from my Plex server using just my voice :-) Eric Abreu It looks like it's actually compatible with several other platforms and languages: https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-other-platforms/ CD RW I need a Pi to build my own Google Home surethom Let's hope developers are better than Google, google cannot even get google home to add calendar entry's or even the basic like play my uploaded music by artist or song title . pfmiller Google Assistant is Google Assistant. This only allows you to access it from 3rd party devices, it's functionality is still in Google's hands. Wikiwix Who builds a Windows Client? Eric Siedlecki Does this mean manufacturers will now be able to add Assistant to their devices, therefore creating actual Google Home rivals? That'll be awesome. It could push innovation and lower prices. Yay! Random! What's the minimum required hardware for Assistant? myssi Raspberry Pi 3 Random! ...which instantaneously adds $40+ to the BOM of any projects which didn't already contain a Raspi. Damn. I found a list where they say it should work in anything able to run Linux, Windows or MAC OS. I wish they would have been more specific about the required processing power. JG Wouldn't mind seeing a Windows based Google Assistant. Replace Cortana. Too bad, though, it appears your stuck using the "OK Google" trigger phrase. Being able to replace it with "OK Computer" would be great in this instance. Avi Faitelewicz See above: "hotword support". JG Hotword support, for the standard "ok Google" trigger. Not custom triggers. Watch the embedded video. He specifically mentioned OK Google or use of a hardware button. No mention of custom trigger phrases. Maxr1998 You could possibly create your own hotword solution to launch Assistant, though of course that's a lot more complicated. myssi hotword support https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cc9e79ed8ff9801b52ea180b2655fa8ba9654b3fa9580faae85323dcecae5328.jpg bozzykid I don't think hotword support means what you think it does.

The iconic Bennington Battle Monument is clearly in Bennington, but ask Google and it will tell you the monument is in Woodford. "The Bennington Battle Monument is at 15 Monument Circle, Woodford, Vermont," the Google app told us. If you live in Bennington, you're not likely to confuse your town with its tiny neighbor 10 minutes to the east. But tech giant Google can't get it right. "For some reason, Google thought that everything around the Bennington area should be called Woodford," said Matt Harrington of the Bennington Area Chamber of Commerce. "I've had many calls with people saying, 'How far are you from Bennington?'" said Lynn Green, who owns the Four Chimneys Inn. For months, Google has put Green's Bennington bed-and-breakfast in the wrong town. She says the error is confusing customers and some guests are choosing other hotels. That's money leaving her pocket. Google Maps is messing with her mail, too. Green says bills are not making it to her mailbox. And the address discrepancy is bumping her website down in Google's search results. "I just did a quick test of about 60 businesses and 58 of them were wrong," Green said. It's a big blow for a town that heavily depends on tourism. Woodford and Bennington share a ZIP code and that may be part of the problem. But who's affected appears completely arbitrary. Take the hospital, for example. Google gets its address correct in Bennington. But it puts several of the other doctors' offices on the hospital campus in Woodford. "Addressing is the key to any public safety agency," said Forest Weyen, the executive director of Bennington Rescue. Weyen says this Google glitch could be putting you at risk since home and business addresses do not match the 911 database. "There could be a delay in dispatchers getting proper resources to them whether that is police, fire or EMS," Weyen said. "It's very hard to get somebody in Google to actually be a human and be listening to you and have the decision-making capability to really change it," Harrington said. The Chamber of Commerce tells us it has tried to fix the problem 700 times, physically editing the addresses for each of its 350 members twice! But 72 hours later the correction always reverts back to Woodford. "In the long run, it's really going to hurt the economy of Bennington," Green said. Green got so frustrated, she started a local task force. After 70 hours on the phone, she was able to convince Google to change the text for her inn's entry but the map remains wrong. "I think Google wants a good user experience and I don't think they're out to hurt Bennington, I think we're just getting lost in the shuffle," Green said. We wanted to hold the tech giant accountable but couldn't get anyone on the phone. After repeated calls and emails, we finally got this statement from Google: "We recognize that there may be inaccuracies that could arise... in this case, we're actively working on the issue and expect to have it fixed in the coming days." In a rural state like Vermont, lots of towns share ZIP codes. So it's unlikely Bennington is Google's only victim. We also reached out to the Vermont attorney general's Consumer Assistance Division. The director said Google worked on the issue all weekend. Apparently, it's a time-consuming fix because each inaccurate address must be fixed manually. We should point out that the glitch does not seem to affect the driving directions, the app will still get you where you need to go.

Yet 100 days into Trump's presidency, the businessman-as-president has struggled to apply his experience as a real estate and entertainment mogul to the Herculean task of governing the world's most powerful nation. ___ Trump tax plan stands to benefit the man in the White House WASHINGTON (AP) — Among the likely winners in President Donald Trump's tax-cut plan would be a real estate developer turned reality TV star who now happens to occupy the White House. The one-page plan released Wednesday sure appears to benefit the president's businesses. ___ Retailers and insurers get taxed more, tech less NEW YORK (AP) — A look at which major U.S. companies pay the most tax and which pay the least. Retailers and health insurer tend to pay more taxes than other companies because they do almost all their business in the U.S., where tax rates are higher. ___ Trump's gyrations on NAFTA cause a flurry of head-scratching WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump campaigned on an "America First" trade policy of bracing clarity: Renegotiate or abandon NAFTA and crack down on China's trade practices. Yet so far, his trade policy has produced mostly confusion and division, even among fellow Republicans. ___ United moves to ease criticism with settlement, new policies DALLAS (AP) — United Airlines moved to staunch criticism — and any customer defections — by reaching a settlement with David Dao, the passenger dragged off one of its planes two weeks ago and issuing new policies designed to prevent similar customer service failures. The airline and Dao's attorney kept the terms confidential. ___ United CEO: I "messed up" with initial response to incident The CEO of United Airlines is talking about the dragging incident on a United Express plane and his response to the incident. Oscar Munoz says his response, in which he blamed the passenger and supported his employees, was 'insensitive beyond belief.' ___ 5 reasons Amazon is experimenting with physical stores NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon's few physical stores seem experimental, with traditional bookstores that feature products you'd find at Best Buy and a convenience store devoid of cashiers. But they could give Amazon a way to grow beyond the internet and might event boost existing online operations. The bookstores, for instance, might introduce book lovers to Kindle e-readers, while some of the efforts will help Amazon save on shipping costs. ___ YouTube ad boycott could spell trouble for Alphabet's Google SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — YouTube's inability to keep ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child. It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service — one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. ___ AP-NORC poll: Most teens have taken social media break NEW YORK (AP) — A new poll finds that most teenagers have taken a break from social media, the bulk of them even voluntarily. Reasons include social media getting in the way or work or school, or teens getting tired of "the conflict and drama." The findings come from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and seem to counter the broader narrative that teens are "handcuffed" to their social media profiles. ___ Starbucks customer traffic stalls amid mobile order issues NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks sales fell short of Wall Street expectations for its fiscal second quarter. The coffee chain has said the congestion created by mobile order-and-pay has discouraged some customers who walk into stores and leave without buying anything. U.S. sales rose 3 percent at established locations, entirely as a result of a higher average check. ___ Court: Employers can pay women less based on past salaries SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals court says employers can legally pay women less than men for the same work based on differences in the employees' previous salaries. The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday overturned a lower-court ruling saying pay differences based exclusively on prior salaries were discriminatory. ___ Exxon fined $20 million for emissions from Texas plant BAYTOWN, Texas (AP) — A judge has ordered Exxon Mobil to pay nearly $20 million for releasing 10 million pounds of pollutants into the air over eight years from a refining and chemical complex it operates east of Houston. U.S. District Judge David Hittner in a ruling Wednesday determined that Texas-based Exxon on thousands of occasions from 2005 to 2013 violated federal clean-air standards. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,388.77.

Google will Mark More HTTP Sites As 'Not Secure' In Chrome, Incognito Mode By AJ Dellinger On 04/27/17 AT 6:02 PM Close Google will begin marking HTTP pages where users can enter data as “not secure” in its Google Chrome browser come October. The change will appear in the release of Chrome 62, and will expand on the browser’s current warning system for unsecure websites. It will also add a “not secure” notification on all HTTP pages visited in incognito mode. Read: Pornhub Goes All-In On Encryption, Now Uses HTTPS By Default Google’s plan will mark any HTTP site that allows a user to type data into it as “not secure” as part of its expanding effort to protect users from sharing information on sites that do not have basic security protocols in place. “When users browse Chrome with incognito mode, they likely have increased expectations of privacy,” Chrome security team member Emily Schechter said in a blog post. “However, HTTP browsing is not private to others on the network, so in version 62 Chrome will also warn users when visiting an HTTP page in incognito mode.” The long-term plan is to issue a security warning on every HTTP page a user visits, even outside incognito mode — a temporary browsing experience that does not save a history of sites visited or files downloaded. Google said HTTPS — a secure and encrypted method for users to connect to websites — is “easier and cheaper than ever before” and improves the overall internet experience for users. Read: What Is SHA-1? Google Cracked A Fundamental Part Of Web Encryption Google began issuing its warnings in Chrome 56, released in January, with a “not secure” label on HTTP sites that had data fields that allowed users to enter passwords or payment and financial information. The search giant said there has been a 23 percent reduction in the number of visits to HTTP pages with password or credit card forms on desktop since it introduced the warning signs. The Difference Between HTTP And HTTPS The difference between HTTP and HTTPS is much more than a single letter — it’s the difference between information being secure and potentially being exposed to hackers and others with malicious intentions. HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and is the protocol that allows for communication between a user and a website’s servers, allowing the user to view and interact with webpages. What is absent from HTTP is encryption. The connection between the user and the server is unencrypted, meaning the information can potentially be intercepted by an attacker sitting in the middle of the conversation between the user and website. HTTPS adds encryption to the equation. The “S” stands for “secure,” meaning you can trust the connection between your computer and the server you are communicated with is encrypted and protected from anyone who may be trying to steal your information. To be considered secure, sites must obtain an SSL (secure sockets layer) certificate, which is used to create the secure and encrypted connection.

Alphabet, Google's parent company, saw its "other revenues" hit nearly $3.1 billion in the first quarter, a gain of about 50% from the same quarter a year earlier. By Seth Fiegerman NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Google is proving it's not just a one-trick pony when it comes to making money. Alphabet, Google's parent company, saw its "other revenues" hit nearly $3.1 billion in the first quarter, a gain of about 50% from the same quarter a year earlier. The segment includes sales from newer Google product categories like hardware, cloud services and the Google Play store. Alphabet sales from its moonshots projects like Fiber and Nest also grew to $244 million in the quarter, up from $165 million a year earlier. However, Google's loss for these ambitious projects ticked up slightly to $855 million. Of course, the vast majority of Google's revenue still comes from its core advertising business, which accounted for $21.4 billion of Alphabet's $24.8 billion in overall sales. In a founders' letter published earlier Thursday, Google cofounder Larry Page suggested the company has gotten better at developing its newer business ventures in the nearly two years since restructuring as Alphabet. "I... think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success," he wrote in the letter. In December, Google spun off its self-driving car program into a separate business called Waymo. Google has also cut staff from its high-speed Internet service and recently brought on a new CEO. Google stock has soared this year, pushing the company's market cap above $600 billion this week for the first time. But there are lingering concerns about the fallout from an advertiser boycott over offensive YouTube content. Some analysts estimate the financial hit to Google could be as much as $500 million -- a significant sum, but a small amount relative to Google's overall sales. Martin Utreras, an analyst with eMarketer, said the boycott was unlikely to affect the first quarter earnings, given the controversy kicked off late in the quarter. "However, with YouTube as a core driver of ad growth, we expect Google to quickly contain and address YouTube's issues in order to maintain growth expectations for the year," Utreras said in a statement.

Name: Subject: Message: Google’s parent Alphabet had a 22 percent rise in revenue for Q1 2017 Newsby John Callaham9 hours ago 1 76 9 Many people may still not know that Google is technically part of a parent company, Alphabet, which was formed in October 2015. Today, Alphabet announced its financial earnings for the first quarter of 2017, and it said it had revenues of $24.750 billion, up 22 percent compared to the $20.257 billion it generated in the same time period a year ago. Alphabet also recorded net income of $5.426 billion for the quarter than ended on March 31, up from $4.207 billion from a year ago. See also: 10 interesting facts about Google July 21, 2016 As usual, the vast majority of Alphabet’s revenues came from its Google division, which brought in $24.506 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up from $20.092 billion from a year ago. All of Alphabet’s other businesses, which include Google Fiber, its Waymo self-driving car team, the Nest smart home products, and others are listed in the the “Other Bets” section of the company’s financial results. The good news is that those divisions generated a combined total of $244 million in revenue for the quarter, up from $165 million from a year ago. The bad news is that “Other Bets” recorded losses of $855 million for the quarter, more than the $774 million in losses that were generated a year ago. As usual, the vast majority of Alphabet’s revenues came from its Google division, Alphabet also broke down Google’s own revenues for the first quarter, revealing that it generated a total of $21.411 billion in revenues in ads from websites and from its Network Members sites, which is up compared to the $18,020 billion it got a year ago. The Google division lists the money it gets from its non-search products in its “Other revenues” section. That includes money from the Google Play Store and the company’s many hardware products like the Pixel and Pixel XL phones, the Daydream View VR headset, the Google WiFi routers, the Chromecast Ultra streaming dongle, and the Google Home speakers, all of which launched in the fourth quarter of 2016. Today’s numbers show revenues from those products had an overall total of $3.095 billion for that quarter, up from $2.072 billion that was recorded from that part of the company a year ago. Google still has not revealed any specific sales numbers for any of its hardware products, including the new Pixel phones. The company had to deal with major supply problems for those phones in the early part of 2017, although it looks like some of those issues have improved. A quick look at the Google Store site shows that both the 32 GB and 128 GB models of the Pixel and Pixel XL are available for immediate shipment, although some colors are still not available.

Levandowski announced his decision in an email to employees, first obtained by Business Insider and confirmed as valid by Uber. Levandowski is still at Uber Advanced Technologies Center, but he's not leading it and won't have oversight over its development of light ranging and sensing radar known as LiDAR, an Uber spokesman confirmed. He is further recusing himself from all decisions around the sensing technology, which is at the center of Waymo's lawsuit against Uber. Waymo, the Google self-driving project that spun out to become a business under Alphabet, filed in February a lawsuit against self-driving truck startup Otto and its parent company Uber for patent infringement and stealing trade secrets. The lawsuit makes a number of allegations specifically against Levandowski, including that he downloaded more than 14,000 confidential and proprietary files shortly before his resignation. The 14,000 files included a wide range of highly confidential files, including Waymo's LiDAR circuit board designs, the lawsuit claims. Otto, which was founded by former Google car and map veterans Levandowski and Lior Ron, was acquired by Uber in August 2016 for $680 million. The lawsuit alleges that Otto and Uber are using key parts of Waymo's self-driving technology, specifically related to its light detection and ranging radar. This technology, known in the industry as LiDAR, measures distance using laser light to generate highly accurate 3D map of the world around the car.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Google Assistant Can Now Run on Any Device, Thanks to a New Software Development Kit By Zara Ali 12 hours ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit Google is currently rolling out Google Assistant to a wider range of compatible Android phones and Android Wear. To extend the feature to more devices, the tech giant today launched a developer preview SDK for Google Assistant that will let it built into third-party devices. The company itself claims that Assistant could be featured on hardware prototypes for stuff like voice-enabled smart mirrors and self-built robots. Being a developer preview, there a few features like hotword support and companion app integration that are missing. Google touts that its Assistant would work on a wider range of devices that fulfill the necessary requirements. Devices like the Raspberry Pi could be put to initial testing for it. Related How to Free up Storage on Your Android Device with Single Tap, Courtesy Google Photos In a blog post, Google writes: Advertisement The Google Assistant SDK includes a gRPC API, a Python open source client that handles authentication and access to the API, samples, and documentation. The SDK allows you to capture a spoken query, for example, “what’s on my calendar”, pass that up to the Google Assistant service and receive an audio response. To further assist developers who opt for Assistant on third-party device integration, Google has created a developer community on Google+. This community would allow developers to discuss new ideas and stay updated with new changed made in the developer preview for Assistant. There is also a StackOverflow tag for questions asked along with mailing list that will keep the developers updated with SDK news. Besides, Google also wants companies that are interested in developing a commercial product to get in touch with it. It also revealed that Android Auto and Android TV would also receive Google Assistant support soon. This is not the first time when Google has extended its support in the form of an SDK for its product. The company had earlier done the same for Google Cast by letting users stream content to different TVs and speakers without Google hardware. However, the products running Alexa were not allowed to access Google Cast. The tech giant reportedly asked smart device manufacturers to make a choice between Google and Amazon. Now with the open availability of Google Assistant, even Alexa supporting smart devices have a window to integrate Google product with their device.

Wall Street grew anxious as a series of high-profile advertisers fled YouTube amid concerns about ads appearing alongside extremist content. But Google's results showed that controversy was little more than a speed bump for the company as quarterly profit climbed 29%. "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising," Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during an earnings call. Alphabet's net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per Class A and B shares and Class C capital stock, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Shares of the company rose 2.8% to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Analysts marveled at the company's ability to continue to post sizeable year-over-year gains from such a large base. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Google's ad revenue, which accounts for the lion's share of its business, rose 18.8% to $21.41 billion in the first quarter. The company is locked in a battle with social media company Facebook Inc in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google is expected to command a 61.6% share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6% in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44%. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7%, according to FactSet StreetAccount. With the traditional business of search advertising maturing, the company is looking to YouTube as its next driver of growth. The strong results also allayed concerns about a recent controversy surrounding the video service and its impact on Google's ad revenue. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. Alphabet is also reaping the benefits of investing heavily in areas such as hardware and cloud. Revenue from its Google Other unit, which includes Pixel smartphone, Play Store and cloud business, rose 49.4 percent to$3.10 billion. The company's consolidated revenue rose 22.2 percent to$24.75 billion from $20.26 billion. © (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Fiat Chrysler Says to Expect Semi-Autonomous, Electric 'Portal' Within Two Years The impressive minivan was unveiled as a concept vehicle at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. by Eric D. Lawrence, Detroit Free Press / April 27, 2017 iimediaevents.com/chryslerportalconcept (TNS) -- While Fiat Chrysler is charging ahead with a deeper partnership with Google's Waymo, that's not the company's only self-driving strategy. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told Wall Street analysts in a conference call Wednesday that the automaker has the capability to produce the Chrysler Portal — a semi-autonomous electric minivan it revealed in January — within the next two years. The automaker's futuristic Portal, which was unveiled as a concept vehicle at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, would be an ambitious effort to capture a slice of the emerging autonomous vehicle. RELATEDGoogle to Enter Ride-Sharing Deal with Fiat Chrysler AutomobilesWaymo Self-Driving Minivan Hits Mountains to Train Software, Collect Snow Data Marchionne agreed that the vehicle could be released in the next year or two and touted the automaker's other major autonomous driving effort, its partnership with Waymo, formerly known as Google's self-driving car project. Both efforts are big steps for a company often tagged as a laggard in the connected and autonomous vehicle race. Marchionne said he was very encouraged by Waymo's program to put consumers in the Phoenix area in self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids to try out the vehicles under everyday driving conditions. The automaker said Tuesday it would produce 500 additional Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans for Waymo. Waymo said those minivans will be used for the early-rider program. Marchionne was willing to enter into a partnership with Waymo even though a number of other automakers passed on the chance to form a partnership with the company. "Because what I think Waymo is capable of doing is leaning on all the work that Goole has done on autonomous vehicles," Marchionne said. "I think they are going to be substantially ahead of everyone else out there. Marchionne also touted the potential of Google Waymo partnership. "This is the kind of exploration that needs to go on. There’s going to be no ready-made solution in the next three years that will effectively exhaust all possible optionalities in this, so we need to play," he said. "And the more we can play, the better we’re going to feel at the end of the day." He also said the industry would be better off sticking to viable autonomous vehicles rather than flying taxis, a reference to reports that flying taxis could be a reality in the next few years. But Marchionne noted that the automaker can't totally depend on its partnership with Waymo as the industry works developing autonomous vehicles, saying the Portal offers another option. "I think banking all of our solutions on one possible outcome is going to be disastrous," he said. The company says the Portal was created by millennials for millennials, touting it as a vehicle that can be upgraded as their lives change and that millennials "expect seamless integration of technology in and out of the vehicle, including to home and other devices." "Millennials have become the largest demographic. In the next 10-plus years, most will be at a point in their life where they will begin to start or will have started a family; 75% of all children will have a millennial parent, and there will be four million more children than today," the release said. The Portal would offer a "third space," which would be a "open and serene atmosphere to bridge work and home." It would get more than 250 miles on a full charge, offer semi self-driving features that would be upgradable as technology progresses, and include seats mounted to tracks so they could move the full length of the vehicle and even be removed. ©2017 the Detroit Free Press Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Alphabet, Google’s parent company, saw its “other revenues” hit nearly $3.1 billion in the first quarter, a gain of about 50% from the same quarter a year earlier. The segment includes sales from newer Google product categories like cloud services, the Google Play store and its growing list of hardware products like the Pixel phone and Google Home. Alphabet does not yet break down sales for each. But on a conference call with analysts Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai touted the company’s continued sales progress in both areas. “We are seeing a meaningful shift and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said of Google’s cloud efforts. Sales from Alphabet’s moonshots projects like Fiber and Nest also grew to $244 million in the quarter, up from $165 million a year earlier. However, Google’s loss for these ambitious projects ticked up slightly to $855 million. Of course, the vast majority of Google’s revenue still comes from its core advertising business, which accounted for $21.4 billion of Alphabet’s $24.8 billion in overall sales. In a founders’ letter published earlier Thursday, Google cofounder Larry Page suggested the company has gotten better at developing its newer business ventures in the nearly two years since restructuring as Alphabet. “I… think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success,” he wrote in the letter. In December, Google spun off its self-driving car program into a separate business called Waymo. Google has also cut staff from its high-speed Internet service and recently brought on a new CEO. Google stock has soared this year, pushing the company’s market cap above $600 billion this week for the first time. The stock was up 4% after hours Thursday. But there are lingering concerns about the fallout from an advertiser boycott over offensive YouTube content. Some analysts estimate the financial hit to Google could be as much as $500 million — a significant sum, but a small amount relative to Google’s overall sales. “We have taken it pretty seriously and we are taking significant steps,” Pichai said on the call. Google has begun investing in artificial intelligence to better pinpoint objectionable content. “I’m pretty confident at the rate at which we’ve made progress.” Martin Utreras, an analyst with eMarketer, said the boycott was unlikely to affect the first quarter earnings, given the controversy kicked off late in the quarter. “However, with YouTube as a core driver of ad growth, we expect Google to quickly contain and address YouTube’s issues in order to maintain growth expectations for the year,” Utreras said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Share Written by Mike Murphy April 27, 2017 Alphabet, and Google before it, has made a habit of making the impressive look mundane. Alphabet reported its 2017 first quarter earnings today, and unsurprisingly, the numbers were stunning. The company reported revenue of $24.7 billion—its second largest quarter ever—a 22% increase over last year’s first quarter. “Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017,” Alphabet’s chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a release. “We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet.” The company’s results were warmly received by Wall Street. Alphabet’s Class C stock rose some 5% to over $46 a share during in after-hours trading. This is in contrast to last quarter, where Alphabet also generated massive amounts of revenue, but missed slightly on what Wall Street was expecting, which caused a steep overnight drop in stock prices. Advertising is still Alphabet’s cash cow Everything that isn’t Google’s search, display, and video advertising is pretty much a rounding error on Alphabet’s revenue, with Other Bets accounting for an almost-nonexistent 0.01% of total revenue. Google’s operating income was more than $7.5 billion, whereas Other Bets lost Alphabet $855 million in the quarter. Google is embedding artificial intelligence into all aspects of its business, with AI now powering search, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company’s earnings call that it’s bringing machine learning intelligence to its advertising options, using AI customize clients’ campaigns, and bring them under all of Google’s platforms. Google’s cloud is growing On the company’s earnings call, Porat said that the cloud business accounted for the company’s biggest growth in capital expenditure and headcount. While the overwhelming majority of Google’s revenue comes from advertising, it has recently started to push its enterprise cloud services business, which could potentially represent a way for the company to diversify beyond digital ads. Alphabet lumps its Google revenues into two buckets—advertising and “other revenues,” which includes its cloud business, as well as things like its hardware sales and Android app downloads. Last year, this bucket accounted for more of Google’s revenue than it had the previous year (11.3% versus 9.6%), totaling $10 billion. In this quarter alone, Google generated $3 billion in “other revenues,” an increase of 50% over the same quarter the year before. Extrapolated across a year, this quarter’s revenue would mean “other revenues” would now be a roughly $12 billion business for Google. Hardware is a mystery In October, Google launched a line of self-branded devices, including the Pixel smartphone and the Google Home smart speaker. Beyond their own value as useful devices, they were arguably attempts to leverage what Google does best (search, mail, maps, apps) and use them to keep customers locked into its ubiquitous software ecosystem, something that Apple also has attempted to do. Alphabet hasn’t broken out any sales figures to indicate how its new devices have been received. While, as mentioned above, Google’s “other revenues” were up sharply from the year-ago quarter, the company didn’t break down the figure between hardware sales, cloud services, and everything else. Pichai said both devices were “well received” by consumers, but didn’t comment further. Other Bets remain just bets—for now Alphabet’s other companies, which range from relatively mature companies like Nest to research divisions like the X lab and Verily Life Sciences, are still hemorrhaging money. Alphabet’s desire to find a “moonshot” answer to problems like curing death and cars that drive themselves cost the company $855 million in the last quarter, amassing only $244 million in revenue. But it’s not all bad news for Other Bets. Revenue is growing for the segment—by 47% over the same quarter last year, even if that still represents a tiny fraction of Alphabet’s revenue. CEO Larry Page said in his letter to investors earlier today that he’s excited (he used this word a lot) about the future of many of the Other Bets companies, and it’s entirely possible that the value of companies like Waymo could even outstrip the billions Google currently generates for Alphabet. And it doesn’t seem like Alphabet will run out of cash to keep funding these moonshots anytime soon.

Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images Google launched its first servers in Cuba this week. Above, people use public Wi-Fi to connect their devices on a Havana street in October 2016. Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images Accessing the Internet in Cuba isn't easy. Home Internet connections are rare, and public access Wi-Fi hotspots costs $1.50 an hour — very expensive for most Cubans. But in the nation that has been called "one of the most restrictive media environments in the world," watching YouTube got faster this week. Google says that its servers just went live on the island — meaning that for the first time, its services like YouTube videos are cached locally, instead of in a neighboring country. Parallels An Object Of Desire: Hope And Yearning For The Internet In Cuba This milestone comes four months after the company signed an agreement with Cuba's national telecom provider, ETECSA, to use its technology to make high-bandwidth activities faster. This marks the first time a foreign Internet company has hosted anything inside Cuba, according to Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Dyn, an Internet performance company. Madory spent time in Havana last year for a conference and talked to Google about their plans for Cuba. After Google made the deal with ETECSA, Madory set up a system that would notify him when the Google's servers in Cuba were live, and yesterday morning, he got pinged. The Two-Way Airbnb Starts Listing Homes In Cuba; Average Rate Is $43 A Night Google's servers in Cuba will cache its own content, allowing for quicker delivery to users. Caching speeds up the Internet by storing frequently used content locally. So the first time someone in Cuba watches a specific video on YouTube, it may take a while to load. But if their neighbor then decides to watch that same video, it should load much faster, because it has been stored on a nearby server and doesn't need to travel as far. While caching makes the Internet speedier in any country, it's particularly vital in Cuba, where connectivity is slow. Cuba connects to the Internet primarily through the ALBA-1 submarine cable, which runs from Venezuela. Google said that Cubans "who already have access to the internet and want to use our services can expect to see an improvement in terms of quality of service" and speed for cached content. That qualifier — "who already have access to the internet" — is significant, since access to the Internet in Cuba is so limited. (As few as 5 percent of Cubans may have access to the open Internet.) Google's servers make it speedier to use its services in Cuba today, but they don't provide Internet access where it wasn't before. For the most part Cubans don't have access to Google's products. "Many users are still relegated to a tightly controlled government network and related email service," says Freedom House, a nonprofit group that conducts research on democracy and human rights. All Tech Considered Internet Freedom Wanes As Governments Target Messaging, Social Apps In its 2016 report on Internet freedom, Freedom House wrote that "Cuba remains one of the world's most repressive environments for information and communication technologies." It added that Cuba's lack of modern Internet infrastructure is one way the government limits access to outside media and information. "Rather than relying on the technically sophisticated filtering and blocking used by other repressive regimes, the Cuban government continues to limit users' access to information primarily via lack of technology and prohibitive costs," it says. But Google's servers join other signs of progress for Internet in the country. The BBC reported last month that ETECSA had installed Internet connections in around 2,000 homes in Old Havana as part of a two-month pilot. Those connections weren't fast enough to stream video, though. With Google's new servers, the dream of watching videos on the Internet — without endless buffering — gets a little closer. internet access Cuba Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

The company said first quarter ad sales on its properties rose 21 percent during the period, while those on its partners' sites climbed just 8.6 percent. Google's own sales now comprise 81 percent of the ad revenue derived from its online network, at $17.4 billion, up from 71 percent a year ago. Total ad sales from all sources rose almost 19 percent to $21.4 billion. "The increase in (Google) sites revenue reflects healthy growth in mobile search," Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said on a conference call with analysts late Thursday. Google has been updating the algorithm it uses to display search results to weed out sites marked by fake news, malware and other unsavory content. It's also been dropping in its rankings mobile sites whose pages are unstable or take a long time to load on consumer's smartphones. While the changes have been made in part to improve the Internet experience of online consumers, they're also benefitting the company's business. show chapters Instinet analyst: A little more pressure on Google versus Amazon    13 Hours Ago | 01:58 Alphabet reported first quarter revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, with sales rising 22 percent from a year ago to $24.75 billion. Its shares rose as much as 4 percent in after-hours trading. "The growth for the size of the company is actually pretty amazing," Denny Fish, a portfolio manager at Janus, told CNBC after the results were released. The revenue gains were driven by a surge in activity on Google services, including its search page and services ranging from Gmail to YouTube. The company said the number of paid clicks on its properties rose a whopping 53 percent year-over-year, while the rise on its partners' sites was a small fraction of that, at 10 percent. The total number of clicks rose 44 percent. Meanwhile, the cost-per-click on Google sites fell 21 percent as the company gets ever more efficient in providing results for advertisers. At the same time, its YouTube property has been garnering an increasing share of video ad dollars.

Julia Love and Rishika Sadam Reuters Published Thursday, Apr. 27, 2017 4:14PM EDT Last updated Thursday, Apr. 27, 2017 8:12PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Google parent Alphabet Inc posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 per cent to $5.43-billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2.8 per cent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 per cent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. “It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 per cent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 per cent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. “Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the ‘prime time’ for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google’s revenue rose 22.2 per cent to $24.75-billion from $20.26-billion in the quarter ended March 31. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 per cent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 per cent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43-billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21-billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google’s non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 per cent to $3.10-billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. “We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. “We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. “That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s “Other Bets”--separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily--continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244-million, up from $165-million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855-million from $774-million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Leaving money to a secret beneficiary (The Canadian Press)   GOOG-QAlphabet Inc Latest Price$874.25 0.00 (0.00%) GOOGL-QAlphabet Inc Latest Price$891.44 0.00 (0.00%) Updated April 27 4:00 PM EDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

By Chris Duckett | April 27, 2017 -- 02:54 GMT (19:54 PDT) | Topic: Security Symantec has laid out its response to Google's proposal last month to reduce the trust in Symantec certificates until a point is reached where Chrome will only trust certificates issued for 279 days or less from the security giant and its subsidiaries. The core of the response is Symantec arguing more audits of its activities will result in greater transparency. The security giant has proposed an audit of all active Extended Validation certificates issued; an auditor to examine certificates issued by former Symantec registration authority (RA) partners, as well as an external audit to look at the remediation work to be completed before September; a six month period-in-time WebTrust audit between December 1 and May 31, followed by quarterly WebTrust audits until a year passes with no action needed; and a third party to conduct a process and systems risk assessment of Symantec's certificate operations. The company said it is backing the move to shorter certificate lifetimes, and from August 31 would begin to "broadly offer" three month certificates. A domain revalidation of all issued certificates with a lifetime longer than nine months would happen at no cost at the nine-month mark, the company said. Symantec said the proposal by Google could result in "complex dependencies" such as: Embedded devices needing to be reimaged, mobile apps having to be updated, and organisations with applications using pinned Symantec certificates failing. "Many of these organisations estimate that just the planning process to prepare to move to a new certificate authority could take many months and in some cases years because of unknown and undocumented dependencies," Symantec said. "Few large enterprises that we've received feedback from have implemented the level of certificate lifecycle automation required to enable safe and cost-effective adoption of shorter validity certificates." In a statement, executive vice president and general manager of Symantec Website Security, Roxane Divol, said the company's proposal was balanced. "As we work to implement these measures, we remain committed to ensuring business continuity for our CA customers and complying with the requirements of the browser community, so that we can reach a solution that is in the best interests of all stakeholders," she said. Last week, Symantec also responded to the list of issues Mozilla had with its behaviour, with the open source browser maker striking down three issues as a result. According to Mozilla policy engineer Gervase Markham, Symantec now faces six major, two intermediate, and four minor issues. In Google's original proposal, Chrome would begin reducing its trust of Symantec in Chrome 59, but has now been pushed back until Chrome 60. "To stress, this delay is not based on a believed reduction of risk, but due to our desire to ensure these changes are appropriately socialized in the ecosystem and ideally interoperable with other browsers' next steps," Google engineer Ryan Sleevi said earlier this month.

Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images Google launched its first servers in Cuba this week. Above, people use public Wi-Fi to connect their devices on a Havana street in October 2016. Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images Accessing the Internet in Cuba isn't easy. Home Internet connections are rare, and public access Wi-Fi hotspots costs $1.50 an hour — very expensive for most Cubans. But in the nation that has been called "one of the most restrictive media environments in the world," watching YouTube got faster this week. Google says that its servers just went live on the island — meaning that for the first time, its services like YouTube videos are cached locally, instead of in a neighboring country. Parallels An Object Of Desire: Hope And Yearning For The Internet In Cuba This milestone comes four months after the company signed an agreement with Cuba's national telecom provider, ETECSA, to use its technology to make high-bandwidth activities faster. This marks the first time a foreign Internet company has hosted anything inside Cuba, according to Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Dyn, an Internet performance company. Madory spent time in Havana last year for a conference and talked to Google about their plans for Cuba. After Google made the deal with ETECSA, Madory set up a system that would notify him when the Google's servers in Cuba were live, and yesterday morning, he got pinged. The Two-Way Airbnb Starts Listing Homes In Cuba; Average Rate Is $43 A Night Google's servers in Cuba will cache its own content, allowing for quicker delivery to users. Caching speeds up the Internet by storing frequently used content locally. So the first time someone in Cuba watches a specific video on YouTube, it may take a while to load. But if their neighbor then decides to watch that same video, it should load much faster, because it has been stored on a nearby server and doesn't need to travel as far. While caching makes the Internet speedier in any country, it's particularly vital in Cuba, where connectivity is slow. Cuba connects to the Internet primarily through the ALBA-1 submarine cable, which runs from Venezuela. Google said that Cubans "who already have access to the internet and want to use our services can expect to see an improvement in terms of quality of service" and speed for cached content. That qualifier — "who already have access to the internet" — is significant, since access to the Internet in Cuba is so limited. (As few as 5 percent of Cubans may have access to the open Internet.) Google's servers make it speedier to use its services in Cuba today, but they don't provide Internet access where it wasn't before. For the most part Cubans don't have access to Google's products. "Many users are still relegated to a tightly controlled government network and related email service," says Freedom House, a nonprofit group that conducts research on democracy and human rights. All Tech Considered Internet Freedom Wanes As Governments Target Messaging, Social Apps In its 2016 report on Internet freedom, Freedom House wrote that "Cuba remains one of the world's most repressive environments for information and communication technologies." It added that Cuba's lack of modern Internet infrastructure is one way the government limits access to outside media and information. "Rather than relying on the technically sophisticated filtering and blocking used by other repressive regimes, the Cuban government continues to limit users' access to information primarily via lack of technology and prohibitive costs," it says. But Google's servers join other signs of progress for Internet in the country. The BBC reported last month that ETECSA had installed Internet connections in around 2,000 homes in Old Havana as part of a two-month pilot. Those connections weren't fast enough to stream video, though. With Google's new servers, the dream of watching videos on the Internet — without endless buffering — gets a little closer. internet access Cuba Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

(NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported first-quarter 2017 results after markets closed Thursday. The search engine behemoth reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.73 on revenues of $24.75 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Alphabet posted EPS of $6.02 on revenues of $20.26 billion. Analysts were estimating EPS of $7.40 on revenues of $24.22 billion. The Google segment posted revenues of $24.51 billion, up from $20.1 billion a year ago. Operating income rose from $6.25 billion to $7.6 billion. The operating loss on other (Bets) revenues totaled $885 million, up from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues at Google websites rose 21.5% to $17.4 billion and Google Network revenues rose 8.6% to $4.01 billion. Ad revenues rose 18.8% to $21.41 billion. Because Alphabet does not break out the source of advertising revenues by desktop vs. mobile, it’s a little hard to draw any conclusion other than an 18% increase is solid. Traffic acquisition costs paid to Google Network members remained flat at 70% of Network revenues, or $2.82 billion. Payments to distribution partners totaled $1.8 billion, about 10% of websites revenues. Total traffic acquisition costs rose from $3.79 to $4.63 billion, or 22% of Google ad revenues. Paid clicks on Google websites were up 53% year over year and up 1% sequentially. Paid clicks on the Network members sites were up 10% year over year and 6% sequentially. Aggregate cost per click fell 19% compared with the year-ago quarter and was down 4% sequentially. Net income for the quarter totaled $5.43 billion, up 29% year over year. Alphabet did not provide a forecast, but the consensus second-quarter estimates call for EPS of $8.08 on revenues of $25.33 billion. For the full year, analysts forecast EPS of $33.33 on revenues of $106.31 billion. Shares traded up about 3.3% at $921.30 in after-hours trading. The 52-week range is $672.66 to $893.38, a level set in Thursday’s regular trading session. Shares closed Thursday at $891.44. The consensus 12-month price target was $979.90 before the earnings report.

Amazon CTO Werner Vogels discusses serverless computing at the AWS Summit in April. (Credit: Amazon) The original promise of cloud computing was simple: no longer would you need to buy, configure, and maintain racks and racks of servers in hopes of growing a tech business into that capacity. All you needed to get up and running was a credit card and some code; if you started slow, you were only on the hook for the resources you consumed, and those resources were limitless. As with most technology advances, the reality turned out to be a bit more complicated. A current customer of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform’s infrastructure-as-a-service products still needs to do quite a bit of work to provision servers, monitor performance, and make sure their costs aren’t running out of control. And customers running legacy applications that would like to move to the cloud have to do even more work to ensure nothing breaks in the transition. But serverless computing might just be the technology that delivers on that original promise. Serverless technologies allow application developers and technology organizations to account for unpredictable spikes in demand without having to specify the resources they’ll need from their cloud provider. “Serverless” is the latest in a long line of confusing tech marketing terms. Put another way: the servers are still there, but you’ll never know it. Dev: so you're saying it's serverless? Ops: oh no, actually there's more servers now than eve– Dev: *Mr Burns voice* serverless — tuxedo masq (@alicegoldfuss) April 25, 2017 “Last year, people were looking to explore. This year will be the year of great maturity,” said Sam Kroonenburg of A Cloud Guru, who will be hosting the Serverless Conference today in Austin, Texas, where 450 serverless enthusiasts will hear presentations from all the major cloud providers on their approaches. Dude, Where’s My Server? Serverless computing is relatively old as a concept inside forward-thinking elite technology companies, but it’s only been about three years since it has started to gain traction. The spark behind this movement was the preview release of AWS Lambda in 2014, which Amazon CTO Werner Vogels recently called “the last crucial piece” in the promise of the cloud. Lambda became generally available almost exactly two years ago. “Lambda really brought to life a managed computing environment, where you no longer need to think about managing instances, or managing servers or managing any type of infrastructure: you could just write code and deploy it,” Vogels said at the AWS Summit in San Francisco last week. Almost all cloud providers now offer serverless capabilities for their cloud customers. Lambda is probably the gold standard, thanks to its early debut and the healthy market share enjoyed by AWS, but Azure Functions have been generally available since last November and Azure CTO Mark Russinovich recently gave an update on the state of Micrsoft’s serverless efforts. Ahead of the Serverless Conference on Thursday, IBM announced new capabilities for its Bluemix OpenWhisk product, including a new API Gateway that allows developers to target multiple endpoints. Google just elevated Google Cloud Functions to beta status, but has not announced a time frame for general availability. Their approaches can be a little different, but they all allow a developer to upload code once and set a “trigger” that instructs the application to behave a certain way in response to certain inputs. Amazon’s serverless explainer. (Amazon Web Services graphic) A classic example of an application that can benefit from a serverless approach is one that might experience rapid, unpredictable spikes in demand, such as when DJ Khaled posts something to Snapchat. Serverless tools can automatically execute code in response to a flood of incoming traffic, or a pre-determined event such as when a file is uploaded to a database. (This well-written primer from Martin Fowler covers all the technical bases.) “One of the things that has come out of this serverless movement is the recognition that an event-based or trigger-based programming model is actually a very powerful model — one where I can get code activated very quickly and respond to it,” Russinovich said earlier this month. The components of Microsoft Azure’s serverless platform. (Microsoft Image) Along those lines, Algorithmia CEO Diego Oppenheimer will discuss how the benefits of serverless computing could enable the next generation of machine learning at our Cloud Tech Summit in the Seattle area this June. And because serverless functions can be spun up and taken down in fractions of a second, a cloud provider is able to charge its customers accordingly, rather than charging them for computing services by the hour, week, month, or even year. “You only have to pay for what you use. This is a tremendous change in the way people are developing applications; build highly scalable environments and only build what they are paying for,” Vogels said last week. Serve and volley This is still early-adopter territory. After all, there are so many companies that are just getting started designing applications for the cloud, let alone embracing something like serverless computing. You have to be a bit of a self-starter to put serverless computing at the heart of your application strategy. The biggest complaint among early adopters of serverless computing is the lack of proper tools optimized for this style. “Some of the basics of software development were not there in early days, like being able to properly debug and deploy,” said Kroonenburg, noting this has improved a lot in just the last year. Google hopes to address this problem by working with the open-source community to develop serverless tools instead of building its own Google Cloud Functions-oriented tools, said Alan Ho, a product marketing manager for the company. Serverless can also get very complicated, very fast, if you’re using it for Internet of Things applications. The Next Web recently published an account of how iRobot is using serverless computing to run its robot vacuum cleaners, and while there are a lot of benefits, “with any technology, here are the places where it works and where it doesn’t, you are always trying to find a balance with how pragmatic the solution is to meet your goals,” said Ben Kehoe, cloud robotics research scientist, in the profile. However, this is clearly an exciting cloud technology — one that could really drive the promise of cloud computing to the next level. “To me, this has strong potential for being the future model of compute,” said Michael Behrendt, a Distinguished Engineer at IBM, “because you really don’t have to pre-buy or pre-allocate; with serverless that goes away. We’re used to that already in other domains, like with APIs: you pay by the API call. Serverless is applying that notion to compute in general.” [Editor’s Note: This story has been corrected to properly spell the last name of IBM’s Michael Behrendt.] Sponsor Post Salesforce Talks Tech in the Architecture Files There’s code behind the cloud: lots of it.

Google parent company Alphabet saw shares rise after beating analyst expectations for its first quarter earnings report. Alphabet, the holding company that includes Google, posted $24.8 billion in revenue, beating the $24.2 billion Wall Street expected, and up 22 percent year-over-year. The company also posted adjusted profit of $7.73 per share; analysts expected $7.41. “Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017, with revenues up 22% versus the first quarter of 2016 and 24% on a constant currency basis,” Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said in a statement. “We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet.” Shares were up 4 percent in after-hours trading; shares are up more than 20 percent in the past year. The Google business (search, ads, maps, apps, cloud, Play, YouTube, Android, virtual reality, etc.) was responsible for $24.5 billion in revenue this past quarter (up from $20.1 billion last year) and $7.6 billion in profits (up from $6.2 billion last year). Alphabet’s category called “Other Bets” — which includes more risky projects like Google X, Nest, Life Sciences unit Verily, self-driving unit Waymo, and more — posted revenue of $244 million on an operating loss of $855 million. That’s up from revenue of $165 million on an operating loss of $774 billion a year ago. In his 2016 shareholders letter, Google co-founder Larry Page highlighted Alphabet’s various “Other Bets” projects and noted how the creation of Alphabet as a new holding company “has helped entrepreneurs build and run companies with the autonomy and speed they need.” From the letter: “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility. We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success. Our recent launch of Waymo was a great example of our learnings. In general we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital, especially significant uses. We’re not going to invest if we don’t see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good. Machine learning and all the efforts around Google Brain and Deepmind are good examples. Google Cloud led by Diane Greene is doing a fabulous job of getting our machine learning hardware and software out to everyone. We were early in machine learning and are already seeing significant dividends coming out. Many of the Alphabet companies are already using this technology and are planning to use it even more.” Google found itself in some controversy this quarter when several big-name brands began pulling ads on YouTube after finding out that their ads appeared opposite offensive content like extremist videos. Fortune reported a possible $750 million loss of ad dollars from the boycott; Google has said it is working to fix the issue. Still, advertising remains Alphabet’s cash cow. Total advertising revenue was $21.4 billion, up from $18 billion last year. Aggregate cost-per-click fell 19 percent, but aggregate paid clicks were up 44 percent from the year-ago quarter. Alphabet added 1,939 employees during Q2 and now employs 73,992 people, up from 64,115 one year ago.

Above, people use public Wi-Fi to connect their devices on a Havana street in October 2016. Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty Images Accessing the Internet in Cuba isn't easy. Home Internet connections are rare, and public access Wi-Fi hotspots costs $1.50 an hour — very expensive for most Cubans. But in the nation that has been called "one of the most restrictive media environments in the world," watching YouTube got faster this week. Google says that its servers just went live on the island — meaning that for the first time, its services like YouTube videos are cached locally, instead of in a neighboring country. Parallels An Object Of Desire: Hope And Yearning For The Internet In Cuba This milestone comes four months after the company signed an agreement with Cuba's national telecom provider, ETECSA, to use its technology to make high-bandwidth activities faster. This marks the first time a foreign Internet company has hosted anything inside Cuba, according to Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Dyn, an Internet performance company. Madory spent time in Havana last year for a conference and talked to Google about their plans for Cuba. After Google made the deal with ETECSA, Madory set up a system that would notify him when the Google's servers in Cuba were live, and yesterday morning, he got pinged. The Two-Way Airbnb Starts Listing Homes In Cuba; Average Rate Is $43 A Night Google's servers in Cuba will cache its own content, allowing for quicker delivery to users. Caching speeds up the Internet by storing frequently used content locally. So the first time someone in Cuba watches a specific video on YouTube, it may take a while to load. But if their neighbor then decides to watch that same video, it should load much faster, because it has been stored on a nearby server and doesn't need to travel as far. While caching makes the Internet speedier in any country, it's particularly vital in Cuba, where connectivity is slow. Cuba connects to the Internet primarily through the ALBA-1 submarine cable, which runs from Venezuela. Google said that Cubans "who already have access to the internet and want to use our services can expect to see an improvement in terms of quality of service" and speed for cached content. That qualifier — "who already have access to the internet" — is significant, since access to the Internet in Cuba is so limited. (As few as 5 percent of Cubans may have access to the open Internet.) Google's servers make it speedier to use its services in Cuba today, but they don't provide Internet access where it wasn't before. For the most part Cubans don't have access to Google's products. "Many users are still relegated to a tightly controlled government network and related email service," says Freedom House, a nonprofit group that conducts research on democracy and human rights. All Tech Considered Internet Freedom Wanes As Governments Target Messaging, Social Apps In its 2016 report on Internet freedom, Freedom House wrote that "Cuba remains one of the world's most repressive environments for information and communication technologies." It added that Cuba's lack of modern Internet infrastructure is one way the government limits access to outside media and information. "Rather than relying on the technically sophisticated filtering and blocking used by other repressive regimes, the Cuban government continues to limit users' access to information primarily via lack of technology and prohibitive costs," it says. But Google's servers join other signs of progress for Internet in the country. The BBC reported last month that ETECSA had installed Internet connections in around 2,000 homes in Old Havana as part of a two-month pilot. Those connections weren't fast enough to stream video, though. With Google's new servers, the dream of watching videos on the Internet — without endless buffering — gets a little closer. internet access Cuba Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:00 AM, April 28, 2017 Updated: 8:05 AM, April 28, 2017 Google parent Alphabet Inc <GOOGL.O> posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet's profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. "For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising." Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook Inc <FB.O>, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. "It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. "Our great properties -- like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play -- are the 'prime time' for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (http://bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that "YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate," dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user," said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR Google's non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> and Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. "We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business," Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors' concerns about Google's dependence on search, Wang said. "We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company," he said. "That is quite an impressive achievement." On the other hand, Alphabet's "Other Bets"--separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily--continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down."

How to customize Chrome's terrible New Tab page Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:02am PDTApr 27, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications News Article Contents 1 Removing suggested content 2 Removing recent downloads and offline pages 3 Removing recently-visited bookmarks 4 Show tabs from other devices 5 Turning on the condensed layout 6 Switching to the Chrome Home interface Back in Chrome 54, Google replaced Chrome for Android's New Tab page with a new design that prominently featured suggested content - much like Google Now's feed. To quote Douglas Adams, "This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. If you're not a fan of Chrome's cluttered New Tab page, there are a few workarounds you can try to make it a bit more usable. You can even mix and match features to create a more personalized design. The below workarounds require enabling or disabling Chrome flags. To do this, navigate to "chrome://flags" (without the quotes), press the menu icon, select 'Find in page,' and type the name of the flag starting with the hashtag symbol. Removing suggested content Removing the suggested articles list is pretty simple. Find the #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Once you do that and re-open Chrome, the list will no longer appear on the New Tab page. Removing recent downloads and offline pages The New Tab page also shows recent file downloads by default, but this is fairly easy to remove as well. Find the #enable-ntp-asset-download-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Then make sure you re-launch Chrome, and it should be gone. In addition, pages you have saved for offline reading show up on the New Tab page. If you want, you can turn this off by disabling #enable-ntp-offline-page-download-suggestions. Removing recently-visited bookmarks By default, Chrome shows bookmarks you have recently visited on the New Tab page. This can also be turned off by disabling the #enable-ntp-bookmark-suggestions flag. Show tabs from other devices As you may know, Chrome syncs your open tabs across your devices, so you can easily pick up from where you left off. There is a hidden flag that adds a 'Tabs from other devices' section to the New Tab Page. The only catch is that suggested articles has to also be turned on, which is a bit of a bummer. To turn it on, make sure both #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions and #enable-ntp-foreign-sessions-suggestions are set to Enabled. Then, reopen Chrome, and your tabs from other devices should appear. Turning on the condensed layout If you do like the suggested content or other features on the page, you still might want to turn on the condensed New Tab page layout. This removes the large space at the top, where the Google logo normally sits, allowing for more content to be visible without scrolling.   Left: Condensed design disabled, Right: Condensed design enabled To turn on the condensed layout, simply enable the #ntp-condensed-layout flag and re-launch Chrome. This is already enabled by default in Chrome Dev, at least on my device, so it may come to Chrome stable in the near future. Switching to the Chrome Home interface Chrome is constantly changing, and there's already another revamp of the New Tab page interface in development. It's called Chrome Home, and it moves the address bar to the bottom of the screen. With this new layout, the New Tab page is accessible by swiping up from the address bar, and it includes navigation icons for Downloads, Bookmarks, and History.    This new design only works on Chrome Dev and Canary for now. To try it out, switch #enable-chrome-home and #ntp-google-g-in-omnibox to Enabled and re-open Chrome. There you have it - a few tips to make Chrome's New Tab page less awful. Let us know in the comments if you have any suggestions we didn't mention. Tags chrome chrome 58 chrome home chrome new tab page chrome ntp new tab page ntp subscribe ...

George at this rate, They need an 'Of The Hour' section... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Switching what the Bixby button does was possible with an app, but the recent update removes this ability. Nerds go apoplectic with rage against Samsung. Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. No outrage yet. Corbin Davenport Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ An EXTRA button, i.e., a button other phones don't even have. Does Samsung have a good reason for locking it into Bixby? It's too early to tell. Shaun39 You should put a sarcasm tag at the end of your clueless comments. EcE An EXTRA button many people reportedly have been pressing accidentally more often than trying to use it. MadMartigan Bingo. They could at least have put it on the other side. As it is, 100% of the time I hit I am trying to turn the volume down. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You'll never admit it, but I guarantee you'd be complaining no matter where they put the button. MadMartigan I think you may be having some trouble reading for comprehension. I'll gladly admit it, as it has been my point all along. Not a fan of Bixby. Not a fan of the button placement. Wouldn't mind at least being able to remap it to make it at least marginally useful rather than just simply in the way. They put the button in a very bad place. Adding insult to injury - they have now disallowed making it at all useful to anyone not inexplicably fond of Bixby. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does. Also, if they put it on the right, I guarantee people would still complain about accidentally pressing it. In other words, you guys will complain about anything as long as it's Samsung. EcE The point you are missing, is the comment you are replying to: "Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change." Having that button which you could be able to disable if Samsung weren't dicks, is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people don't even have yet. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! The nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. EcE Because when someone found a way to change it's behavior, Samsung quickly blocked it. An extra hardware button is more annoying than a home page you can just ignore, period. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And you can use another browser. Nobody's forcing you to use Chrome. You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it. Or just buy a phone without an extra button. That'll show Samsung. Same difference. MadMartigan "You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it." Proof positive you just straight up refuse to understand that the placement is a problem for some people. "Just not pressing it" is not as simple as you seem to want to make it sound. I've accidentally launched it several times trying to lower the volume on the 8+ and I can only imagine it would be even worse on the S8. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Proof positive you're just a whiny baby. I've accidentally pressed the volume button many times when trying to press the power button, because my hand grabs both sides of the phone to get the leverage to press the power button. As much as it may amaze you to hear this, I survive this heart-rending inconvenience. MadMartigan God forbid anyone express an opinion that doesn't cast Samsung in the best possible light... /s MadMartigan ..and you nerd rage against anyone who thinks it might not be the best thing ever, can we talk about that, maybe? You know, since we're apparently not allowed to discuss the possibility that they might have handled it better? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You implied that the lack of complaints was because Chrome 58 is still rolling out. I pointed out that the nerd rage about the button occurred before people got their phones, thus nullifying your point. Discuss anything you want. MadMartigan Except any possibility that Samsung could have done something better. Apparently we're not allowed to do that without being called names... MadMartigan "If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does." So a bad key placement could not be made at least marginally better by allowing to map to something you might actually someday use... Got it. Your logic is flawless... /s Necdet Ali Özdür How come people don't press other buttons accidentally but​ somehow keep pressing Bixby button all the time? EcE Who said that? Necdet Ali Özdür ... you? EcE Oh yeah? I said: "Bixby is the only button people press accidentally" ... I'm sure I did. and btw, HTC's power button just below the volume buttons is/was (HTC 9/10 and whichever else they did the same) something to complain about as well. Either way, the point here is that having an extra button that cannot be disabled/remapped is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people have not seen yet. Necdet Ali Özdür That doesn't mean those people won't see it, I guess that's the point you are missing. Both decisions can be reversed by respective parties by means of a software update, but people (especially here in Android Police) complain about Samsung the most. EcE Nah, I think we enjoy bi+ching about everything Necdet Ali Özdür Who doesn't? 😂 MadMartigan Possibly due to it's bad placement. Have you been paying attention? Necdet Ali Özdür It's placed where a button could be placed on an all screen phone. Like the rest of them it's on the side. MadMartigan So there's no other place they could have put it? Really? I hope you're actually trying to be dense... Do phones you use not have tops, bottoms, or right sides? Do they have no room at all below where the button is currently placed on the left? Necdet Ali Özdür I hope that next phone you own will have a power button on the bottom and volume buttons on the top. Because those are valid positions to place buttons. Yeah. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It doesn't matter where the buttons are. If it's a Samsung phone, at least 75% of AP commenters will be outraged. MadMartigan ...and the one fanboy will attempt to shout down anyone with a valid opinion regarding how it could have been better. Because to him, Sammy can do no wrong. FWIW: I have not owned a Samsung since the S2 and as this was the first one without the ridiculous home button, I jumped at it. I like pretty much *everything* about the device other than the absurd Bixby-button. MadMartigan lmao. Are you being serious? HTC had power buttons on the top - never once accidentally powered it off. You really cannot accept that the placement may not be optimal for some people? That this is the only place they could have put it? Necdet Ali Özdür It's in a place where majority of current devices have their buttons. Sounds more optimal to me than the places you've suggested. Some people may not like to have it at that place, or not have that extra button at all. But in my opinion it is the best place to place Samsung could've put it. MadMartigan So the right side, where there is currently only one button, would be a worse place for it? They couldn't texture the power button and have the bixby button 1/2 inch below it? That wouldn't be better than the same texture as the volume keys, and right next to them? I mean heck, even if they'd just added a texture to it...that would have been better. Necdet Ali Özdür It is significantly smaller than the volume button (which is a rocker now) which makes it easy to differentiate with a finger. But yeah a texture wouldn't hurt. I agree you on this one. But if it was on the right side, I'm pretty sure people would still complain as much as they do now, claiming they're confusing it with the power button and such. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're complaining because it's a Samsung phone. If this was a button on the Pixel, it could be in the worst possible location and they'd go to the ends of the earth to defend it. MadMartigan Honestly, I would have loved it on the right, in a perfect location to be hit by the finger right above the pinky when needed. Power-index, Bixby two fingers down. Would have, IMO, been perfect. Could have even gone without the texture on that one. Where it is now, you're going after it with your thumb. Until muscle-memory kicks in, it's a crap-shoot where it's going to land initially and unless you expect to have to double-check, you're going in to press - and could easily press the wrong one. It's all personal preference, to be sure, but I do believe they could have appeased far more people by putting it on the right. FWIW - the same complain was leveled at HTC when they placed the power/volume buttons on the same side, though I do not believe the volume was a rocker on that model. Could have been done better. My favorite device was actually the One M7 - which had the power-button on the top. Power-top, volume-right, nothing on the left. Zero possibility of confusion. (Power on the back would have been fine as well - V20 nailed the fingerprint sensor/power on that one.) bekifft There is no good reason for locking hardware functionality away from the user. Don't give them a pass on taking more control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ As I say below, the nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. This isn't about timing. It's about Google love vs. Samsung hate. MadMartigan Wow. Someone's triggered... Tiuri Elvander I was and am still outraged. Have been since this came up in the review of 58 Beta Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, so far, that makes one of you, vs. the dozens of people who went into a nerd rage about the Bixby button, many of whom don't even have or want the phone. MJ I don't use Chrome a lot to care enough to disable the new tab page crap but why would Google stop users from customizing it? I can do that with Firefox... Address bar at the bottom of the screen? WTF? Michel Sa Address bar at the bottom makes a lot more sense on a mobile phone. Renan In a mobile phone, having the address bar at the bottom of the screen makes a lot of sense MJ No... ipsofact yes... MJ How have I been able to use the address bar on my phone at the top all this time? EcE Magic? ipsofact we never said you could not use the address bar on your phone. But on mobile its a lot quicker and pain free to have it at the bottom. Unless you want to stretch your thumb all the time. MJ Come on... Are you a human? When I hold my phone my thumb is already naturally pointing toward the top of my phone so would need to stretch it to make it to the bottom. Regardless, I happen to have nine other fingers and the on-screen keyboard pops up in the same place anyway. I have been using the address bar at the top of browsers for over 20 years now so don't need to be changing my workflow habits now and just on my phone on top of it. ipsofact typical ive been doing this for 20 years so I wont change the way I work. You know I work with several people with the same mentality.. I have been using the address bar at the top since day 1 but today I changed it to the bottom. Works great and believe me I won't let the old "ive been doing it like this for years" ever stop me. Or just put the phone upside down. it works ;) MJ Change is not the issue... It's change for no good reason or benefit. At least give the user control to change it back. Some unknown God(s) at Google one day just deciding the address bar will now go at the bottom is ridiculous. Microsoft tried that crap on a larger scale with Windows 8. How did that work out for them? ipsofact You can change it back and forth. Its up to the user to decide. So we are not being obligated to do anything. Just given options! :) Which I like. I can decide the whether the bar will go up the top or the bottom. MJ What? LOL The whole article is about Google not allowing users to disable the crap on new tabs. Thanks for your input and have a good day. MadMartigan "It's change for no good reason or benefit." Thankfully, your refusal to see the reason or benefit does not affect the ability of anyone else to. MadMartigan He said it made sense on the bottom - not that it wasn't unusable on the top. Reading is fundamental. FeelThePoveR It depends on the usage. Sometimes I press my hardware buttons accidentally when doing the swipe up gesture on the bottom adress bar in chrome (closing the tab/app or whatever). I'm still loving it though. MadMartigan People still use mobile Firefox?? ipsofact Firefox still use mobile people? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Except for Android and the Play Store (and their dependencies), I'm off all Google apps. I'm sick of the constant BS coming out of Google. I use Dolphin as my browser. If I get frustrated with Android enough, I'll just give up my precious S Pen and give an iPhone a chance. MadMartigan I loved that change and wish they'd bring it to desktop Chrome. Would love a "Google Now" start-page on the desktop. Kieron Quinn I've used iChrome as a Google Now-esque NTP for a while, it used to be a lot better (especially when it actually got Google Now cards via a hidden API) but is slowly getting worse: http://i.imgur.com/vfO7Kfq.png TomsDisqusted The suggested content is all the worst possible sources of news on the internet - I guess those are the ones that have the most advertising revenue per view - so I'm glad to see there is a way to get rid of it. It would be better though if Google would simply show me news from the sources that I actually use! Tiuri Elvander I disabled the suggestions and they were indeed gone. Instead I got some annoying round image with some text saying "that's all for now. More articles will appear soon." Uninstalled 58 and installed 57 again. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions isn't available in mine, so I can't turn on Recent Tabs like I'd like to... cgrant There are apps that will do this without all the fuss. Try TabMark. deepdvd That's a Chrome extension, not a mobile app. Try again? pfmiller I think the easiest solution is just to stick with Chrome 57 until Google fixes this mess. Peter I want my bookmarks back on the New Tab Page, or at least a link to them. Having to open the menu to get to the bookmarks is a pain when trying to open lots. bekifft Thank you for this article. This is just further encouraging my use of Brave. Not a big fan of the name, though.

Amazon surpassed Wall Street expectations by revealing a 41pc increase in profit, the latest sign that the once chronically-unprofitable internet retailer is finally rewarding investors’ faith. The company posted net income of $724m (£561m) in the first quarter of the year and said sales had risen by 23pc to $35.7bn. Much of the growth in profits were largely driven by Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing division, which has proven to be more lucrative than its giant internet retailer. Shares, which have now risen by more than 50pc in the last year, climbed by more than 4pc in after-hours trading. Alphabet’s results also exceeded forecasts, as Google’s advertising juggernaut continued unabated. The company’s revenues grew 22pc to $24.8bn, while profits were up 29pc to $5.4bn. Google’s advertising business accounted for almost all of sales, with the company appearing to brush off a recent advertiser boycott of YouTube amid concerns about commercials appearing next to terrorist and offensive videos. Sales in the UK grew by 16pc when adjusted for the falling pound. Google's advertising sales leapt despite a boycott of YouTube Credit: PA Shares rose by almost 5pc in after-hours trading. This week, Alphabet’s market value has surpassed $600bn for the first time, with industry figures showing Google and Facebook accounted for 99pc of all growth in the US advertising market last year. The company also showed growth in other areas, including Google’s cloud computing division, and Nest, Alphabet's smart home gadget division. Microsoft also reported a rise in profits on Thursday night, although shares dipped slightly with the results worse than expected. Amazon’s chief executive Jeff Bezos, who owns 17pc of the company, is now closing in on Microsoft’s founder Bill Gates as the world’s richest man.

It’s not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service — one that could undercut Google’s growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet’s first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn’t start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. The company’s earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday’s extended trading. White House ends hiring freeze, mandates workforce, mission restructuring Advertisement CLOUD OVER YOUTUBE But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. “There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person,” says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. “They don’t want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don’t have to because they have many other choices.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had “thousands and thousands” of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. “We are evolving overall to a better place,” Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing “extraordinary” growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won’t leave a huge dent in Alphabet’s earnings. That’s because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company’s golden goose — Google’s dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet’s revenue even as it expands into other fields. ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. TAKING THE GLOSS OFF Before the boycott began, YouTube’s ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn’t disclose YouTube’s finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn’t have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. “This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand,” says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. FLIGHT OF THE BRANDS At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It’s unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn’t advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn’t respond. TEMPORARY HIT OR PERMANENT SCAR? Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. “It’s going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away,” he said. “There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term.” Investors, however, apparently aren’t too worried so far. YouTube’s financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google’s ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet’s net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

Fake news have been making headlines for quite some time now. Major internet companies, such as Google and Facebook, have even partnered in Europe to fight them. Also, Google has recently updated its Fact Check tool and Facebook has launched an educational guide to its users about fake news earlier this month. But Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's founder, believes the problem is rooted on how current media outlets are funded. Our society is now connected as never before and hence advertisers are the main source of money for news companies, which are usually paid based on the amount of user's clicks. In order to avoid such a system, Wales has decided to create a novel news organization dubbed Wikitribune. The organization would be funded by donations and, according to Wales, this new wiki-style website would bring to readers "fact-based articles that have a real impact in both local and global events". Also, by the aid of a team of journalists and a supportive community, stories could be easily verified and improved, following Wikipedia's example. Wales explains his reasoning further in the following video for the Wikitribune launch campaign. Wikitribune is still in its initial stages , and has already received donations from almost 7000 supporters and hired four of the aimed ten journalists for the main team. For those who want to support the idea, a monthly subscription is available, even though everyone will be able to read the articles without any kind of paywall. Finally, subscribers will be able to give their opinion on what subjects Wikitribune will cover, but no details were shared about how this is going to work.

Now Google is taking steps to help spread Assistant even farther. Google today launched the Google Assistant SDK in a developer preview. With this SDK, developers can begin building hardware prototypes and include the Google Assistant with them. In a video demo, Google shows off a DIY mocktails mixer robot with the Google Assistant built-in. We’ll just have to wait and see what kind of devices come to market with Assistant built-in, and since today is the first day that the Assistant SDK preview is available, it might be a little bit before we start seeing Assistant-equipped devices launch to the public. Still, this is exciting news, as it means that the number of devices that offer Google’s voice assistant could greatly expand, giving users more ways to integrate it into their lives. Do you use Google Assistant? If so, which devices do you use it on?

Many of the materials in this book have been used by the authors to teach more than 100,000 students in a Massive Online Course from 2013 till now. We always carry a mobile phone. We cannot go anywhere without one. The use of our smartphones, iPads and laptops depend on technologies that have made communications faster. Dennis Strigl, former president and CEO Verizon Wireless (which sells broadband) tells the authors that when he first worked in the wireless business. McKinsey & Company estimated there would be 900,000 wireless subscribers by 2000. That figure was beaten a hundredfold and by the end of 2014, there were 344 million users worldwide. “And we can attribute that to an outstanding network, a good product that works for our customers, and also to the fact that prices have continually come down over the years, from what was an executive’s backseat-of-a-limousine device to what is now an everyday device,” Strigl is quoted as saying in “The Power of Networks. In the late 1990s, not many believed in the future of text messages but now smartphones have pictures and stream videos. The quality of the network and its continuous improvement over the years are the backbone of Verizon’s success. “The big challenge that we had was that we spent almost $15 billion a year on buildings, plant and equipment. In the early 2000s, what we saw was a diminishing portion of our revenues coming from voice and a growing portion coming from data,” said Strigl, who guarantees that “the price per unit of usage will continue to come down as the usage grows, the consumer and the commercial usage grows and the revenue stream to the carrier grows, and as the costs continually come down both from manufacturers and from the carriers themselves.” In 2006, the word “Googling” was added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Google has more than 55,000 employees and in 2014, it generated $66 billion with 90 percent of its revenues from ads alone. But what is truly remarkable about Google is that we are always able to find what we are looking for. And this is due to the creative genius of Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They came up with a new approach for ranking web pages based on two factors: relevance and importance. The concept of relevance set Google’s vision apart because it shows how relevant the content of the page is to a given search query. “But it’s the notion of importance that made Page Rank, Google’s ranking algorithm (a clever pun on Larry Page’s name), much more successful than previous approaches. It has been a driving force in bringing Google fame since the late 1990s,” wrote Brinton and Chiang. The authors also interview Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011. Asked what he considers an ideal way to communicate with one other, Schmidt replies: “If you look at society today, people are over-communicating all the time, and I think that the lesson from technology is that people want to communicate all the time in every conceivable way, and that you’ll see a multiplicity of ways that they communicate… So I think you’re going to see lots of different forms of communication. So while I’m talking to you, I’m getting e-mails, I’m getting texts, I’m getting voice-mails… One of the more interesting statistics is that, in a given week, someone touches their phone 1,500 times. The average teenager sends more than 100 texts a day. So the revolution in communications is deep and profound. It’s a very, very, very large explosion of communication in all forms.” A growing amount of retail shopping is done on the Internet. In 2014, people spent $1.3 trillion buying items online. This number is expected to double by 2018. The largest online retailer in the US is Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994 as an online bookstore. Amazon did not plan to make any profit until the turn of the century and it was one of few online companies to survive when the dot.com bubble burst around 2000. Amazon made its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001. Nowadays it not only sells books but everything including clothing, shoes, software and electronic devices. It offers competitive prices, free shipping in some cases and, most of all, it provides its customers with practical feedback through product reviews. YouTube, founded by three former PayPal employees in February 2005, grew very fast. By July 2006, YouTube was getting 65,000 new videos and 100 million views daily. A few months later, Google bought it for $1.65 billion. In October 2009, the site registered 1 billion daily views. By mid-2016, the number of views had reached 5 billion. The most famous video to go viral is “Gangnam Style.” This four-minute video by the Korean singer PSY was the first video to register 1 billion views, in December 2012. Two years later, it reached 2 billion views. Facebook remains the largest social networking site; it is used today by 1.65 billion people representing more than one-fifth of all the people on earth. Mark Zuckerberg launched a social networking site in 2004 known then as “Thefacebook” for his classmates at Harvard University. It kept attracting students from Ivy League universities until in 2006, the site began allowing anyone 13 years or older with a valid e-mail address to join. In 2012, Facebook registered 1 billion users and had its first public offering. Twitter, launched in July 2006, is another social network, which gives its users the possibility of sending tweets which are text messages with a maximum of 140 characters. It grew from 400,000 tweets per quarter in 2007 to 100 million per quarter in 2008 and in 2015 Twitter was handling almost 500 million tweets per day. Nowadays, besides social, communication and economic networks, we are witnessing the rise of cyber physical systems also called the Internet of Things. There are wearable objects that help track our bodies’ vital signs while we exercise and there are also devices that allow us to remotely control the temperature or to look at video cameras monitoring the security of our houses. During a conversation with the authors, Vinton Cerf, recognized as one of the fathers of the Internet with Bob Kahn, is asked which of these devices are science fiction and which ones will be happening. “I think that we’re going to see progress literally on all fronts at some pace over the course of the next several decades. So I don’t see much of this as science fiction, to be honest. Even things like self-driving cars that we work on at Google are not science fiction anymore… “The one thing I do worry about though is that a lot of these devices may be designed and are built with relatively small processing power. The question is whether or not there is enough processing power, for example to encrypt traffic to ensure privacy of data. And we should be very concerned about the safety and security, and privacy of these systems, since a lot of the data that’s collected could be interpreted and abused ... So we have a whole lot of safety, security and privacy challenges in the cyber physical systems.” “The Power of Networks” explains how networks are transforming our society. Networking is changing the way we think, live and work. Our success depends on our ability to understand how these new technologies are creating the digital economy. We use the Internet and we still do not know enough about how our personal data is being traded by advertising markets. Internet companies have gone some way to showing their users what information about them has been sold to advertisers. It has been suggested that a reasonable regulation would require that the disclosures are always a click away and mandate periodic “push” notifications about the information being gathered.

As it should be. Updated by Caroline Kitchener Apr 27, 2017, 9:30am EDT tweet share A bike on the Google campus in Mountain View, California. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images Vox's home for compelling, provocative narrative essays. During her senior year at Vassar, Heather Kobayashi attended a campus recruitment event for Epic, a health record software company based near Madison, Wisconsin. “I just went for the free pizza, but then I heard them saying, ‘You don’t need experience in health care; we’re looking for people who are eager to learn,’” she said. When Kobayashi started working at Epic the following summer, she joined the company at the same time as hundreds of other first-year graduates. Moving to Madison, she hardly knew anyone, and immediately befriended the people in her class. Three years later, most of her friends are people who started working at Epic when she did. “Anyone at Epic can say, ‘I’m going to form a board game group or a book club,’” said Kobayashi. “You can stay on campus after office hours and there will always be a lot of Epic people there.” Related Why a third of Ivy League grads go to Wall Street Epic is just one of many companies that essentially give graduates the option to stay in college after graduation. Corporations that aggressively recruit large numbers of recent grads from elite colleges — mostly tech companies and consulting firms — understand how much the employees miss their undergraduate experience. To ease the transition, they offer extracurricular activities, designated mentors, report cards, and, most importantly, a large “class” of 22-year-old co-workers who all undergo the transition together. I understand why this kind of workplace appeals to so many recent graduates. When I left college in 2014, I developed a new appreciation for school. My entire life I’d been surrounded by a group of people my own age, relying on teachers, parents, and administrators to help me make friends, solve problems, and find direction. For 17 years, I’d been part of a large, supportive community — a womb of sorts — that was actively invested in me reaching my full potential. And then, suddenly, I wasn’t. I left that community to live with eight strangers and write a book alone in a coffee shop for eight hours a day. It was the most difficult transition I’d ever made. As hard as it was, though, I’m glad I went through it. The transition out of school is an important rite of passage. I learned to how to be lonely, face uncertainty, and confront failure. I grew up. Even though it’s tempting to take a job at a college-like company, graduating seniors should consider what they might miss by choosing that path. Eventually, the lessons learned during a typical first year out of college might turn out to be even more valuable than a job at a place like Google. “All of your daily life things are taken care of so that you can focus on your work and not have to worry about anything else” More and more graduates are opting to ease, or skip, the transition to the “real world.” Instead of learning to construct their own community, they move from one tight-knit, well-organized community to the next. On its website, Bain, a leading consulting firm, tells potential recruits that as associate consultants, the firm’s entry-level consulting role, they will be “working alongside the warmest, brightest, and most supportive peer group.” First-year employees are pictured in groups, hanging out outside of work: on a ski trip, at a baseball game, playing volleyball. Every “class” has an appointed social chair, responsible for planning class-wide, Bain-sponsored social events. “We’ve found that one big driver of people’s satisfaction, as well as personal development and growth, is being able to form really close-knit relationships within the office — relationships that will span years,” said Kate Bennett, associate consultant program manager at Bain’s Boston office, in an online video. At Google, employees can choose from hundreds of interest groups like juggling clubs and a cappella groups, Google’s version of college extracurricular activities. Many companies also offer structured, formal mentorship to young employees, similar to what they received from academic advisers in college and college counselors in high school. Oliver Wyman, another large consulting firm, assigns new employees a “career adviser” when they start work. That adviser reads all of the advisees’ performance reviews, and regularly engages them in discussions about their progress and goals. The performance review is a five-page rubric that provides detailed feedback on every aspect of the employee’s work, much like a school report card. High schools and colleges often provide an array of resources and facilities to make life easier for students. Now companies are doing the same thing. At Google, employees have access to dry-cleaning services, massage treatments, gyms, coffee shops, hair salons, cafeterias, health clinics — all heavily discounted or free of charge. These facilities are scattered around Google’s offices in Mountain View, California, which employees aptly call a “campus.” “At Google, all of your daily life things are taken care of so that you can focus on your work and not have to worry about anything else,” said a Google employee and 2015 college graduate. Why companies are trying to recreate the college experience at work This phenomenon — companies recruiting heavily from college campuses and providing a college-like work environment — is relatively new. In an interview, Cynthia Mathieu, a professor of clinical psychology at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivière, said that in recent years, large companies have started to recruit more and more new employees directly from college campuses. According to Mathieu, companies want to recruit college seniors for a couple of reasons: first, they are rapidly expanding and regularly need a large crop of fresh hires, and second, they want first dibs on new talent. “For companies to be competitive worldwide, they need to be attracting the best candidates,” she said. “By recruiting at colleges and getting a huge pool of applicants, they can choose the best ones. They don’t have to wait for a good candidate to find their organization.” To attract the best young candidates, companies need to make themselves appealing to college seniors. Brad Gilbreath, a professor who specializes in work environment at Colorado State University, says that Google, in particular, has created an extremely attractive workplace. After Google’s college-like atmosphere was covered extensively, other companies have adopted the approach. “Companies think: If we want these people to come work for this, then we need to start shaping our organization to create what they like,” said Gilbreath. “Google has gotten so much press on its workplace environment, so of course that publicity has a big effect.” My first year out of school was really hard and painful. As it should be. I spent the year after graduation following four women who graduated with me in 2014, and writing about their first year out of college. None of them joined one of these college-like companies, and all of them struggled with the same things I did. We were all completely unsure of the decisions we were making about our futures, and separated from the people who used to point us in the right direction. For most of us, the hardest part of leaving college was losing our community. One of the women, Alex, moved to Redmond, a suburb of Seattle, to work from home with her brother. She didn’t know anyone in the area, and spent most of her free time Skyping with her girlfriend on the East Coast. Most days, the only people she spoke to in person were her brother and his wife. She had a countdown app installed on her phone, counting down the days until she flew back East. She was miserable. But three months into Alex’s first year out of college, she started making some changes. She moved out of Redmond and into downtown Seattle, renting an apartment in a neighborhood known as a hub for 20-somethings. She actively sought out interesting events and activities, and made a new group of friends. A few months later, she broke up with her girlfriend, created an OKCupid profile, and began dating in Seattle. Less than a year after graduation, she had learned to create a community of her own. This pattern was the same for me and every woman I interviewed: We struggled through a few months of loneliness, took risks, made a couple of friends, and then, finally, started to settle into a new place. One of the women started attending a new church; another created her own band. I bought a pizza maker and invited everyone I could think of to my house for pizza parties. While we didn’t have professors or career advisers, we found other people we felt comfortable going to for advice: bosses, family members, older friends from church. Other parts of the school experience — report cards, catered meals — we couldn’t just go out and find. So we learned to live without them, and that was a valuable experience too. Some graduates who immediately start working at companies like Bain and Google push themselves to get outside of the company bubble — to leave the “school” community. When Kobayashi first moved to Madison, she prioritized getting to know people outside of Epic, signing up for a variety of meetups she found online. “In the beginning, I didn't know that I'd develop such a close-knit group of friends from my hire group, so I tried a couple of ways to get out there and make friends. Now I don't do it so much, but I think it's good to put myself in situations where I'm forced to talk about something other than work,” said Kobayashi. But as Kobayashi experienced, the communities these companies provide can be hard to resist. One 2015 graduate at a major consulting firm told me that he looks at some of the older employees at company and worries. For many of them, work subsumes life. At work, they are comfortable and cared for. They don’t feel like their lives need to change, and as a result, they still live like college students at age 30. And he’s not sure whether that’s a good thing. Caroline Kitchener is the author of the new book Post Grad: Five Women and Their First Year Out of College.

Alphabet reports $24.75 billion in Q1 revenues, beating expectations Ad revenues rose 19 percent year over year. Ginny Marvin on April 27, 2017 at 5:01 pm More Google parent Alphabet Inc. announced revenues of $24.75 billion for the first quarter of this year, a 22 percent increase year over year. That’s above analyst expectations, and the stock is up in after-hours trading. Ad revenues were $21.4 billion, a 19 percent increase over Q1 2015. Google site revenues were $17.4 billion (up 21 percent), and network revenues were $4 billion (up 9 percent). Paid clicks were up on Google sites and network properties, 53 percent and 10 percent respectively. The trend of lower YoY CPCs continued, with Google site CPCs down 21 percent and network CPCs off 17 percent. Alphabet made some changes to the way it reports paid clicks and CPCs this quarter: “In the first quarter of 2017, we refined our methodology for paid clicks and cost-per-click to include additional categories of TrueView engagement ads and exclude non-engagement based trial ad formats. This change resulted in a modest increase in paid clicks and a modest decrease in cost-per-click.” The following table reflects the updated methodology: About The Author Ginny Marvin As Third Door Media's paid media reporter, Ginny Marvin writes about paid online marketing topics including paid search, paid social, display and retargeting for Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.

Cooking is about obtaining the right recipe and doing the right thing the right time. With Google Home, you can access up to 5 million recipes, cook the perfect meal for your household, and take all the glory while the smart assistance takes the back seat. “But what if you could listen to a recipe and your favorite music, all at the same time? To help you perfect your kitchen skills, we’re introducing the ability to cook with the Google Assistant on Google Home,” wrote Software Engineer, Emma Persky in a blog post. The smart assistance made by Google is now able to offer you opportunities that extend beyond accessing 5 million recipes. You can now also ask questions and be walked through the process of cooking your favorite meals. With Google Home, you are now in charge of asking the questions, dish out instructions, ask for repetition of steps, and even move on to the next step. All recipes have been indexed from The New York Times, Bon Appetite, the Food Network, and a host of others. Google is also making it easier to find your favorite recipes; but this time, you won’t need your Google Home. With the Google Assistant on your phone, you can find a recipe easily and send it to the Google Home. Similar task can also be repeated with your iOS or Android device, but this time, on the Google Search app. To recite recipe with your Google Assistant, simply select the option “send to Google Home.” This will ensure that the recipe gets saved to the Google smart speaker to be used now or later. Using the speaker after the recipe is not a difficult thing to do. As soon as you are ready to cook, you will have to use the command “Ok Google, start cooking” or “Ok Google, start recipe.” The process is really very easy, and only takes a few minutes to get used to. Video Credit: https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/cooking-with-the-assistant-google-home-your-secret-ingredient/ While cooking in the kitchen, you can ask your Google Home to do some other things like play you music. Better still, you can ask it to repeat a particular step, and even convert measurements—all these can be made possible without losing the exact place you are in your recipe. Google said the new feature will be available in the next couple of days. Set up is not necessary as all you need to do is send a recipe to your Google Home or start on the device and you are good to go! Just about a week ago, Google upgraded Google Home with ability to connect up to six accounts. This was made known today by Yury Pinsky, Product Manager Google Assistant in a blog post. This upgrade means multiple users in the US can train their Home hubs to recognize different voices of up to six people. That’s not all; the app now has the ability to keep profiles of every one of them.

Imagine working hard. You have an “above average” track record. You’ve never heard complaints — you even won the coveted “best employee” award last month. So, your company decides to reward you by… Demoting you. Sounds bizarre and untrue, doesn’t it? Who’d be thick enough to punish an employee for doing a great job? Doing a Great Job Isn’t Enough AntarcticGorillas, a StackExchange user, shared the story above. He was genuinely frustrated because he did everything he was supposed to do, but ended up getting demoted instead. Another StackExchange user dishes out some advice. “Wow sounds like you failed to play the office politics game effectively. Good performance is never enough. You don’t play the game and you lose, 100% of the time if you are in management.” He takes his bad advice even further. “Ok now you have to salvage what is left. First, and I know you are going to hate this one, you have to make friends with your new boss. You have to get him to mentor you. You have to help him and not show your resentment. Yeah I know you resent him, you wouldn’t be human if you didn’t. But this is the time to take the high road. This guy clearly has the office politics down pat, you need to learn from him.” His advice is partially true. Good performance isn’t enough. It’s the baseline. His advice to lie and manipulate? That stinks. But it isn’t the worst part. It’s the belief behind it. I’m a _ Worker, I Deserve a Raise As employees, we have the tendency to think we “deserve” it. Developers do a great job. Most of us do everything we’re supposed to do. Still, many are disappointed with the money they’re making. We know that many employers do their best to underpay. They walk a fine line, giving just enough to keep us on board, without affecting the profit margins they want. It seems like your boss takes advantage of you. You’re working your hands to the bone. You’re doing everything you’re asked to do and more. When your company’s in a bind, you deliver. Last minute updates? You get things done. Issues with scope creep? You handle it masterfully. When you don’t get the raise you deserve, it feels like an insult. More often than not, the issue has less to do with your work performance and more to do with the intangible details. Behaviors and counterproductive decisions that alienate allies, partners and opportunities. These mistakes make it harder to get the raise we’re hoping for. Social conditioning leads many to ignore this stuff. “Ugh! Soft skills,” you might say. But these unexpected, common mistakes impact raises every day. Mistake #1: What I Deserve vs What I Want There’s a growing problem that’s slowly eroding good will in the developer community. Entitlement. Open source entitlement is a great example. It goes like this: Developer needs code to solve a problem Developer finds open source code. It solves the problem Code creates problems Developer becomes angry, demands authors fix now. (For free!) It’s an oversimplification but it conveys the point. These open source authors aren’t at our beck and call. It’s a terrible idea to demand extensive tech support, then write angry letters when we don’t get our way. Mattias Petter Johansson over at FunFunFunction dives deeper into “developer entitlement.” When we feel entitled, we overestimate our abilities and our contributions. We swallow the lie our ego feeds us. “You deserve this. You’re a senior developer after all.” Developers with this mindset are bargaining on the wrong side of the tracks. Here’s how your boss thinks about raises. “Holy crap, this is the guy that 10x’d our leads and sales in 18 months. The app he developed turned things around for us. We’re going to need to spend more if we want to keep this guy.” See the difference? They’re not operating from an entitled mindset. They’re approaching your raise from a transactional mindset, namely… What am I getting for my money? We’re not entitled to a raise. We’re not entitled to a promotion. Yet developers continue to approach salaries and promotions from an entitled mindset. I did a good job this year so, you “owe me.” They usually make their approach like this. Which is the part where managers give their blunt and unsatisfying answer. Nope. Mistake #2: Being Right vs Being Respectful Justin Keller, entrepreneur, developer and founder of San Francisco startup Commando.io wrote an open letter to the mayor. He was upset about the homeless in his community. He didn’t want to see them on his way to work. “The wealthy working people have earned their right to live in the city. They went out, got an education, work hard, and earned it. I shouldn’t have to worry about being accosted. I shouldn’t have to see the pain, struggle, and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work every day. I want my parents when they visit to have a great experience, and enjoy this special place.” Maybe he didn’t mean to convey feelings of contempt and condescension. But, his words were still hurtful and disrespectful. He had a point. No one wants to live in a neighborhood filled with homeless people. Homeless people don’t want to live the way they do. We’re human, it’s normal to dislike these things. Those who can avoid it, do so. Those who can’t, endure it. The general thrust of his argument is this: He doesn’t want to deal with the problems that homeless people bring. Okay. But that’s not really the problem here. It’s the othering of a group or type of people he views as beneath him. That’s the problem. Developers struggle with the very same issue. As a developer, you’re typically sure about your views. You’re logical and precise. You’re right and you know it, which is part of the problem. You have a choice to make. Be right. You can show everyone that you are, in fact, correct. That your way is right. This comes at a steep price if it’s handled poorly. Protect the relationship. You can treat others with respect, avoid humiliating them and allow them to save face when they’re wrong. Developers who focus on being “right” tend to be disrespectful. They burn allies and earn enemies. Developers who focus on relationships first, discover their influence grows with those around them. They’re viewed as trustworthy, and more people listen when they have something to say. Being right is easy when everyone values your feedback. Getting that raise or promotion is tough if you’re viewed as a snobby, know-it-all jerk. Mistake #3: My Career vs My Loyalty Google has been at the top of Fortune magazine’s list of best companies to work for every year since 2007. The job perks are legendary. For many, a spot at Google is a dream come true. So why is Google struggling to keep its employees? A recent report by PayScale states the median employee tenure at Google is a little over one year. Its workforce has grown, but it’s struggling to keep its people. It’s not because Googlers are unhappy. 84 percent of their 28,500 employees state they have a high level of job satisfaction which, as you’d expect, is one of the highest among the Fortune 500. Other tech firms aren’t having the same problem. The average tenure at Yahoo! and Microsoft is 2.4 and 4 years respectively. Yikes. The problem is loyalty. Loyalty is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Employees are loyal to a fulfilling career, not a job — 78% would stay if they knew they had a career path. #HR #EmployeeEngagement https://t.co/TgHqkxS69Q — Mercer (@mercer) December 9, 2016 It’s not entirely our fault; We’re given bad advice. The strategy is:”Don’t ask for a raise, get a new job instead.” It’s a destructive strategy that results in less trust. Employers limit the responsibility they give you because they believe you won’t be here that long anyway… Work has become this cutthroat environment where we all pretend to look out for the team, when in reality, we’re looking out for ourselves. If you’re a sophisticated developer, you know. At many companies, project managers and other developers are all too eager to throw each other under the bus for more money. When an opportunity comes along, these employees will eat each other for the chance to win. Jumping from job to job only works for so long. Disloyalty catches up with you as your market value drops. There’s no reason an employer should go out of their way to keep a disloyal developer. Here’s what loyalty looks like to them. Fidelity. You’re not sharing company secrets, discussing internal politics or airing the dirty laundry at work. You’re behaving in a trustworthy and honorable way, even when no one is watching. Ownership. A good manager looks for ownership. Treating the business as your business too. Looking out for and protecting the company’s interests at all times. You use good judgment and do what needs to be done without being told. Stability. You’re rock solid. A teammate your co-workers can count on. When something bad happens you roll up your sleeves and get to work. There’s no whining, complaining or fussing about getting things done. Consistent. Your boss and co-workers have an internal compass telling them who you are. Your behavior is consistent. Your teammates can easily dispel rumors about you, because they know and trust you. These are the hallmarks of loyalty. Employers are looking for talented developers who are loyal. Do great work, display this kind of loyalty and a smart employer will fight to keep you. Mistake #4: Settling Scores vs Forgiveness JournalSpace was a free blogging platform like Blogger or WordPress. Still a startup at six years old, they decided to focus on writing code and building their business. They also chose to outsource hosting to a managed service provider. They wanted a simple backup plan. Forget about 3rd party or offsite backups, just RAID the drives. Unfortunately for JournalSpace, their RAID did exactly what it was supposed to do — copy changes from one drive to another. As it turns out, they had a disgruntled employee who deleted the database containing their customer data on his way out, immediately putting JournalSpace out of business. @tinythoughts Unbelievable #journalspace … and even so unbelievable is that it sounds as if this has been _the_ (one) IT guy who did it — Volker Göbbels (@VolkerGoebbels) January 3, 2009 Most people don’t forgive and forget. They nurse their grudges. But, settling scores often has unintended consequences. If you’re someone who’s focused on settling scores, you aren’t fooling anyone. Your co-workers notice. Your managers notice. They’re aware of the workplace grudges, the subtle political plays used to put others down. Most people are pretty good at reading the social temperature of their workplace. What does that mean for you? You guessed it. If you’re viewed as the cause or contributor you won’t get the raise or promotion you’re looking for. Mistake #5: What I Want vs Reality Talia Jane, a Yelp employee wrote an embarrassing open letter to Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelmann, complaining about her low pay. In her letter, she stated she didn’t have enough money for groceries, bills or even heat, spending 80 percent of her income on rent. In San Francisco. An Open Letter To My CEO: https://t.co/F7ekRtOm04 — talia jane (@itsa_talia) February 19, 2016 She blindsided her boss with gems like these… “…after I had moved and got firmly stuck in this apartment with this debt, I was told I’d have to work in support for an entire year before I would be able to move to a different department. A whole year answering calls and talking to customers just for the hope that someday I’d be able to make memes and twitter jokes about food. If you follow me on twitter, which you don’t, you’d know that these are things I already do…” It went downhill from there. It was a PR headache. She humiliated her boss and the company she worked for with her ambush. And the best part? She expected a raise for it! What she wanted wasn’t compatible with reality. Talia felt entitled to a promotion and pay raise she didn’t actually deserve. She’s completely replaceable and she hasn’t brought any high value skills or experience to the company. What’s worse, she hasn’t framed her request from her employer’s point of view. When it comes to getting a raise or promotion, your boss desperately wants to give you what you want if you… Frame your request around what they want and what they need. Go against your own self interest (e.g. don’t give me a raise if I fail to…) Pitch your raise as the solution to their fears, frustrations and problems. Provide evidence or proof showing you can deliver the outcome and results you’ve promised. Talia was right. She was underpaid. So why was she was fired two hours after posting her open letter? She used shame and guilt as a mechanism to get what she wanted. Her open letter focused entirely on one person. Talia. She didn’t spend any time on her employer’s concerns. Employers want you to answer a very simple question. What’s in it for me? Frame your request around this question and you’re far more likely to get what you want. Mistake #6: Get It Now vs Get It Later An entire generation is struggling with job satisfaction at work. They’re desperate to make a difference, to make an impact at work. The problem is most of them lack the patience, experience, know-how or maturity to make their lofty ideas work. Who am I talking about? Millennials. Simon Sinek shares his experience with Millennials who want to “make an impact” at work. Here’s what he had to say about it. Did you catch the key points in Simon’s story? The Millennials he speaks with have noble goals. But they’re unhappy about the fact that they haven’t made an impact… … After only eight months. Not eight months at a new job. Eight months at their first job ever. They have almost zero real world experience. They don’t know what they don’t know. They don’t even know what they mean by “making an impact.” It’s a hazy idea they don’t know how to implement, but they’re all ready to burn bridges and destroy an amazing opportunity with a great employer. All because they don’t “feel” they’ve made an impact. It’s a disaster because employees like these are viewed as basket cases. They out themselves as needy, unstable teammates who’ll pout, whine and complain when they don’t get their way. What If You Make All of These Mistakes & You Get Your Way? It happens, believe it or not. But, it’s the exception, not the rule. Most employers operate with a transactional mindset. This for that. More money for more value. It’s the secret that unsophisticated developers miss. It all boils down to a single word. Self. When we focus exclusively on ourselves it usually points to two distinct causes. Self absorbed. We’re typically self absorbed when we’re in pain or in trouble. “My wife is pregnant, I need a raise. I don’t have enough money for rent/food/heat.” It’s the expectation that your boss is responsible for eliminating your pain or problem. Selfishness. We’re selfish when we’re focused more on what we think we deserve and less on how we can serve others. If your boss offers a raise and your first response is, “How dare you!” or “Is this all you think of me?” Selfishness is probably to blame. A raise is an indicator your employer wants to keep you. Were you passed over for a raise? Consider it a warning shot. There’s a problem you need to fix and fast. Doing a Good Job Is Not a Good Reason Average developers use “doing a good job” as rationalization for a raise. Talia and AntarcticGorillas made the same mistake. Millions of developers will make the same exact mistake tomorrow. The results will be the same. Rejection. An entitled mindset creates struggle. A transactional mindset creates reward. You don’t have to struggle. You can have the raise, the promotion you want. What will you offer in return? Give your employer a compelling answer and they’ll fight to keep you. Give them the evidence they need and you’ll get the income you’re looking for. No demotions, politics or games.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. Search marketing can bring lots of benefits to your business and provide great marketing ROI. If you do it right, organic search provides you with a high-quality source of qualified traffic. However, SEO is much more than keywords and links. There are lots of technical aspects to SEO that, if you’re not careful, can trip you up and keep your site from performing as well as it could. Here are five of the most common or trickiest to diagnose technical SEO mistakes you should avoid on your website. Overzealous Robots.txt Files Your robots.txt file is an important tool for your website’s SEO, and an integral part of making sure your website is properly crawled and indexed by Google. As we’ve explained in the past, there all sorts of reasons you wouldn’t want a page or folder to get indexed by search engines. However, errors in robots.txt files is one of the main culprits behind SEO problems. A common technique to mitigate duplicate content issues when migrating a website, disallowing entire servers, will cause whole sites not to get indexed. So, if you’re seeing a migrated site failing to get traffic, check your robots.txt file right away. If it looks like this: User-agent: *
Disallow: /
 You’ve got an overzealous file that’s preventing all crawlers from accessing your site. Fix this by getting more specific with the commands you issue in your file. Stick to specifying specific pages, folders or file types in the disallow lines like so: User-agent: *
Disallow: /folder/copypage1.html
Disallow: /folder/duplicatepages/
Disallow: *.ppt$
 Of course, if you created the original robots.txt file as part of your website migration, wait until you’re done before you start allowing bots to crawl your site. Inadvertent NoIndex Tags The meta robots tag goes hand-in-hand with the robots.txt file. In fact, it can be wise to double up by using the meta robots tag on a page you’ve disallowed via robots.txt. The reason is that robots.txt won’t stop search engines from accessing and crawling a page it finds by following a link from another site. So it could still wind up indexing pages you don’t want crawled. The solution to this is to add the meta robots noindex tag (also known just as the noindex tag) to pages you really, really don’t want indexed. It’s a simple tag that goes in a page’s <head>: <meta name="robots” content=”noindex”>
 Again, there are plenty of times you’d want to use the meta robots tag to prevent a page from getting indexed. However, if your pages aren’t getting crawled (you can check this using the site: search operator in Google), this should be one of the first things you check. If you’ve used the site: search operator to check the number of pages you have indexed and it’s way below the number of pages you actually have, it’s time to crawl your site. Use WooRank’s Site Crawl feature to crawl your pages. Then, click on Indexing. Pages that are disallowed via the meta robots tag will be listed here. No problems with meta robots here. Nice. Unoptimized Redirects No matter how much you try to avoid using them, 301 redirects are sometimes necessary. 301s (and now 302s) enable you to move pages to new locations and still maintain link juice, authority and ranking power for those pages. However, 301s can only help your site’s SEO if you use them correctly. Implementing them incorrectly, or setting them and then forgetting about them completely, will deteriorate your user experience and search optimization. There are four main ways unoptimized 301 redirects will hurt your SEO. Redirect Chains Let’s say you could have a page at www.example.com/search-engine-optimization that you decide to move to www.example.com/SEO. And then, a few months later, you decide to move it to www.example.com/marketing/SEO. Now you’ve got a redirect chain on your hands. A redirect chain occurs when a link points to a URL that redirects users to another URL that redirects users to a third (or fourth, or fifth, etc.) URL. They can occur when you’ve moved a page multiple times. Even though all 3xx redirects pass full link equity, you still need to avoid piling redirects on top of each other because each one is going to add to your page load time. It may seem like quibbling to care so much about milliseconds, but when every tenth of a second can impact your conversions, it’s a quibble worth quibbling. And once you start stacking two or three redirects on top of each other, your users will be waiting an extra two or three seconds to get to the final page. You, and Google, are going to see a high bounce rate. Again, use a crawler here to find instances of redirect chains. The Screaming Frog SEO Spider has a nice report that will show you every redirect chain you link to. This report includes external redirect chains, which you don’t have any control over. Redirecting Internal Links Sometimes you just can’t stop a backlink from pointing at a redirected URL. However, there’s no reason for the links under your control, your internal links, to point at 3xx redirects. These redirects add unnecessary load times to your pages. To find your redirected internal links head to Google Search Console and download your internal links under Search Traffic. Use the concatenate function in Excel to insert your domain in front of the URL. Then, copy and paste those URLs into your crawler to return your internal links that return a 3xx status. This will give you a nice list of every redirected internal link you have on your site. The process of fixing these links is as simple as updating the destination URL to the new URL. Redirected Canonical URLs As the name would suggest, canonical URLs are, well, the right URL according to your website’s canon. They are your “true” URLs. So it stands to reason that the URLs listed in your site’s canonical tags should never point to a redirect. Search engines will follow the link in a canonical tag and pass the page’s ranking attributes there. So, functionally, adding a 301 to that process is like creating a redirect chain; the crawler now has to go through two steps to get to the destination. Crawl your site to compile your list of URLs used in canonical tags, and then crawl that list of URLs to find the ones returning a 3xx status. Update either your canonical tags (or server, depending on which is the issue) to point canonical links at non-redirecting URLs. Mismatching Canonical URLs Along with redirecting canonical URLs, having conflicting canonical URLs is another tricky technical SEO mistake that could be holding back your pages. Conflicting canonicals, or canonical mismatches, occur when the URL used in a page’s canonical tag doesn’t match other places you should be using your canonical URL. The two most common instances of this include: Sitemap mismatch: This error occurs when the link in the canonical tag doesn’t match the URL listed in your sitemap. Relative links: Search engines only recognize full URLs in canonical tag, so using just a file, folder or path here isn’t going to do anything for you. Canonical tags are an important tool in the fight against duplicate content and sending link juice to the right pages. Using mismatch URLs here is going to undermine that whole strategy, causing search engines to see lots of duplicate pages (relative to the size of your site, of course) and for large reservoirs of link equity to form, benefiting only one page on your site. Hreflang Return Tag Errors The hreflang tag is used to point search engines and other web crawlers to alternate versions of a particular page in other languages. It can also specify that a page is meant for users in a certain country. If you’ve got an international and/or multilingual website, you’ve got hreflang tags on your pages (and if you don’t, you really should). One technical mistake that’s easy to make with hreflang errors is what’s known as the “return tag error.” This error occurs when page A references page B in an hreflang tab, but page B doesn’t have a corresponding tag for page A. So, for page A, you’d have: <link rel="alternate” hreflang=”en” href=”https://www.example.com/page-A”> 

<link rel="alternate” hreflang=”es” href=”https://www.example.com/page-B”>
 While page B would just have: <link rel="alternate” hreflang=”es” href=”https://www.example.com/page-B”>
 Every version of a page must reference every other version for hreflang to work properly. Make sure to note that pages have to reference themselves also. Missing the self-referencing tag is probably the most likely cause of hreflang return tag errors. You can find hreflang tags that have return tag errors in Google Search Console in the International Targeting report under Search Traffic. If you’ve used WooRank’s Site Crawl to find any of the other errors above, you’ll also find return tag errors and other mistakes with hreflang in the Canonical section. Again, no errors here. Nice. Wrapping It Up Dodging these five technical SEO mistakes won’t automatically put your website at the top of Google search results. That requires a lot of on page and off page SEO. However, avoiding, or finding and fixing, these technical errors will make it much easier for Google to correctly find, crawl and index your pages. Which is the ultimate goal of technical SEO.

X Google parent Alphabet posts 29% rise in quarterly profit Surge in advertising on mobiles and YouTube drives increase about 10 hours ago Alphabet is also reaping the benefits of investing heavily in areas such as hardware and cloud. A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass. Photograph: REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski Previous Image Next Image         Google parent Alphabet posted a 29 per cent rise in quarterly profit, driven by a surge in advertising on mobiles and its popular YouTube video service. Alphabet’s net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the first quarter ended March 31st from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Shares of the company rose 2.8 per cent to $916.8 after the bell on Thursday. Google’s ad revenue, which accounts for a lion’s share of its business, rose 18.8 per cent to $21.41 billion in the first quarter. The company is locked in a battle with social media giant Facebook in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google is expected to command a 61.6 per cent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 per cent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 per cent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 per cent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. With the traditional business of search advertising maturing, the company is looking to YouTube as its next driver of growth. The strong results also allayed concerns about a recent controversy surrounding the video service and its impact on Google’s ad revenue. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. Alphabet is also reaping the benefits of investing heavily in areas such as hardware and cloud. Revenue from its Google Other unit, which includes Pixel smartphone, Play Store and cloud business, rose 49.4 per cent to $3.10 billion. The company’s consolidated revenue rose 22.2 per cent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion. Analysts an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share. - Reuters       Topics: Facebook Google YouTube Read More Microsoft profits up 27% on demand for cloud services Intel’s profits in first quarter rise near 45% Trinity College confirms money lost in cybersecurity attack Digitary goes big Down Under with universities deal Review: Is the iKettle 2.0 worth the investment?

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon.

They respond within moments, but that response is always boilerplate like you mentioned. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Charles222 I usually roll with Google auto-creating events in calendar for me like they do, and the random stuff that doesn't float through my email goes to Todoist. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Charles222 Having a few Homes around the house is what pushed it for me. I'll remember some random-ass thing I need to do in the future, and I don't take my phone to bed (or have it particularly nearby generally at home) as a rule...but I do have a Home in the bedroom and just being able to talk to to Todoist to set up an event is fantastic. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. bekifft Pretty sure that one was for example, I doubt his dog's name is actually Fido. I admit it is kind of unlikely you'd get that many reminders in one notification, but it does illustrate the point that Google hasn't quite thought the system through. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v bekifft This happens to me too. Not so extreme, but it seemingly sometimes takes Google quite a while to realize I'm home for reminders. Which is strange because they bloody well know that I'm home, they spend all day burning through my battery to make sure they know where I am at all times. Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Scott Scrivens I have tried Tick-Tick actually, and I seem to remember not liking the UX. It's seems it's had a considerable makeover since then though so I'll check it out again, cheers. Jock Murray I use Business Tasks by Appgenix-software.com I don't think Google realise the importance of their Google Tasks. The ability to nest tasks and have descriptions/comments attached to each task, is critical. Keep users don't know what they're missing out on. Scott Scrivens Looks good, I'll check it out! pantagruel I use Business Calendar 2 with support for Google Tasks built in. Smarter choice if you use your calendar as well. bekifft Since we're recommending apps, this one seems the best, and uses Google Tasks as its back end. Come to think of it, I'm not sure Google Tasks even has an official front end anymore, but Google seems to have forgotten to shut it down. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.splendo Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. morrisp Well, it won't appear (or notify you) on the desktop Calendar -- but will still notify you in the Calendar app, yes? N8SLC Yes, morrisp. :) Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. F4LL0U7 If you're talking about reminders set through the Google app, you have to go into the Google app's settings and enable sound & vibration for those notifications. I think they're off by default. ellett Nope, I don't use reminders through the Google app. I do all of my calendar-related operations through Calendar. Putting appointments, reminders, notifications and alarms in different places is just plain wrong. F4LL0U7 Ha, you have a point. It might seem obvious, but you just might want to check and make sure the notification sound is enabled in Calendar also. I think that one might be off by default too. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. iCON You are talking about a company that has six different messengers... Scott Scrivens I'd say it's more about whether it's profitable, rather than whether it's possible. Sad truth. F4LL0U7 There was a recent article on AP (I forget who wrote it) about Google's messenger strategy (or lack thereof) that seemed pretty spot-on. I would bet their reminder strategy is pretty similar. bekifft That, and I don't think they've had a clear reminders strategy from the beginning, and probably still don't. With reminders tied into all these services, it's probably an engineering nightmare at this point. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Naxx ENVY ^ this , his phones on like 5% , hes like . i forgot something , let me check my list ... oh right yea charge phone . Scott Scrivens Because the battery on my Nexus 5X doesn't last the whole day. So a reminder to charge it at around 4PM is useful. I'm not always able to, but if I intend to be out of the house in the evening it's a necessity unfortunately 😩 Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different Scott Scrivens Agree with Luzandro. It's probably the best option but still not as good as the Google app input method. bekifft Yes and ironically the Google app does not yet have any app shortcuts. Add Reminder and View Reminders would be two excellent choices. TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. morrisp The stock iOS Reminders app is indeed buggy -- notifications sometimes don't go off. It's a big problem! I recently switched to using an app called MinimaList for most of my reminders. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like. Scott Scrivens You're right about this, and it does work well enough. I just wish Inbox reminder notifications wouldn't disappear after a random amount of time. Miguel Hernandez I know this may sound blasphemous to some in this community but how about Cortana? It has a widget that show upcoming reminders and easy add reminder button and is cross-device with Windows 10. Antonio Gabbiano Exactly the same thoughts that I have. The fastest way to add a reminder is via shortcut for Inbox. Hanny Yeung Google Reminder as a new separate app in 3...2...1... Btw, I use Loop for my recurring reminders. Good design & usability, plus I can track my habit performance (I saw Vitamins in your calendar and that seems to be a suitable entry for Loop). Everything else are occasional, so they're in Google, created by voice command. Agreed an app shortcut from Google app and a separation of each reminder in notifications would make life easier. Vivek Shah I completely agree with Scott. The reminder options in Google Calendar desperately needs a overhaul. Hope they're reading this. Polyterative Calendar is great but abbandoned by google.. I'm a power user and these annoyances are really bad bekifft I wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's definitely not a core product anymore. They made it to compete with Microsoft and Exchange back in the day, and it was effective at that, but that's not what they care about anymore. So actually yeah, I can see how it is kind of abandoned. _jack_ Tbh, that's why I use another app for reminders and to-dos. I hate this inconsistencies, and a dedicated service for reminders isn't a bad idea (especially when using them extensively). makapav Not to mention there is no option to make the reminder notification more aggressive: intensity, repeat, persistence. vodanium I really miss that, too! Sometimes I want a reminder to really grasp my attention to do the task at the very moment. In other cases, though, it is not an issue to miss the notification for a few minutes/hours - most of the to-do activities are like this. I've been using The Clock app for "hard" notifications, but it is far from being ideal: e.g. it can be used for reminders within one week only, no option for sophisticated recurrences (e.g. bi-weekly), etc. makapav In other words - it's a usability clusterfuck. bekifft I've started using this app specifically for recurring reminders. Not sure whether it's a good thing or bad thing that Google leaves these gaping holes to third party providers, but here check it out: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bleyl.recurrence&hl=en Rafael Reinoldes Not to mention their task management system, We can create a task list in keep, export it to docs and suddenly they were not tasks anymore, while gmail still have a half-baked task functionality that doesn't support remainders, but supports nested items!! Rafael Reinoldes Forgot about the inability to import lists from docs to keep again Rafael Reinoldes Did you said 'chrome'?!? How could anyone set a remainder from chrome? Scott Scrivens Search "add reminder" in Google. As long as you're signed into your Google account you'll get this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b7f84553cb8c9298712a98dc6a5f355c79fb13f00154d89a39eaa785046cdab9.png Rafael Reinoldes Not working here, even in an anonymous tab, probably only available in US, tested in android and desktop from Brazil. Scott Scrivens Interesting. I'm in the UK and it works for me. Maybe not everywhere though. Sorry to get your hopes up. You are signed into Google right? Rafael Reinoldes I am logged into google, mainly, because I get a lot of value by syncing stuff across different computers. Scott Scrivens That's annoying, not sure why it wouldn't work in Brazil :( Nathan Type "add reminder" in the Chrome address box. I do it all the time on my PC because it is faster than picking up my phone, but I was also experiencing problems with notifications for reminders set in Chrome not appearing on any of my devices. Now I know why. Rodrigo Chiong It's true that the reminders situation a mess. But I do see a launcher shortcut to add reminders from Inbox that work alright. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dc3b51117bfc2b134dc2fdf28b442f4389a3730166e304ee5ae2969fbe776d83.png Scott Scrivens This is true, and it does work pretty well. The only issue is that, as others have pointed out, Inbox reminder notifications seem to disappear after a little while. I like to leave my reminder notifications in the shade until I get to them. Rodrigo Chiong Well that's also true. You never know if the notification will come from Calendar, Keep, Inbox or the Google app and they all behave differently (particularly the snooze feature) KB You don't need "add reminder" in the search box, just typing "reminder" is sufficient. Dan While adding a reminder in chrome only allows times in 30 minute increments, there is a workaround for at least this part: include the specific time (and optionally the actual reminder text itself) in your 'add reminder' search: 'add reminder 7:40pm' will pre-fill the time for you (although changing the time will still only allow the 30 minute incremented time values) or just search the entire reminder: 'add reminder take out the trash at 7:40pm' or 'remind me to take out the trash at 7:40pm' hopefully this helps someone else Scott Scrivens Great find. As a way of crowdsourcing fixes this is proving very worthwhile. Chris Sanner lessee....what else about reminders bugs me - 1) if you want to dismiss a recurring notification early one dya your only option is to dismiss it *forever* 2) no "repeat x time after completion" option. this is the thing that most keeps me on other todo apps. I might not replace my furnace filter ON THE DAY it's due - but I want to be reminded again a month after I *DO* replace and dismiss it. Joe Dink AMEN! So true! It's pathetic. On such a good platform, otherwise. Chris I agree the reminder system has some shortcomings. I was frustrated recently when the assistant had all but removed entering a reminder by typing if you're in a situation where you can't use your voice. So, I wrote this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccwilcox.quickreminders Its shortcuts to create Google reminders. I depend on reminders, as well Scott Scrivens That looks really useful. Incompatible with my 5X though sadly... Chris Not compatible with the 5X? I'll look into that asap and fix that... Scott Scrivens Let me know when you do, I'll give it a whirl. Chris What country are you in? Are you in the US? Currently, I have the Play Store distribution set to US only for compatibility with Google's app service F4LL0U7 I recently got Android Wear 2.0 on my GWR, and noticed that I don't even receive reminders on there anymore! I set all my reminders through Google Now, and last night I got a monthly reminder at 9pm on my phone. Nothing at all showed up on my watch. I navigated to the Reminders app on my watch, and the recurring reminder was in the list, but it showed zero current reminders. WTF! Seems like this might be a leftover bug from AW 1.x, where I would receive reminders right on time on my watch, but they were not actionable. If I tried marking one as done, it would think for a few seconds, and then I'd get the frowning cloud icon saying I wasn't connected. But I WAS connected, damn you Google! Josh A The app shortcuts u said Google should add on the home screen can be added to the home screen by holding on the icon again. For example, look at the pic added https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae1ec39a9aa7517f5e7184c8e8332418e71499a85ea1c56450445ad292f0ba61.png Patrick O’Hara To me, the issue isn't getting reminders into the device. The issue is that there is only 1 type of reminder and it's easy to miss. There should be multiple reminder types. Silent, visual, audible, and urgent, for example. I've set lots of reminders that I never got because my volume was turned down. myssi GIVE ME REMINDER WITH DURATION!! Trip66 To find all your reminders all you have to do is say Okay Google show me my reminders and scroll the list the most recent ones are usually on top I've never had any problems finding them. Devin Quesenberry Scott, hang in there pal. You're not alone in your struggle. I've been trying to find a digital solution for my non-scheduling mind since the Trapper Keeper days. Some days I still have to carry around pen and paper, but I'm grateful for google reminders nonetheless. When Inbox came out I signed up because I liked the idea of merging my to-do list with my email (I wish Google would capitalize on this more, but it seems to me that they are starting to take the shotgun approach to development in general). However, I still find myself needing other apps like Keep and Onenote to get the job done. Reminders help me compartmentalize the many hats I have to wear between work, home, and volunteer life, so DO NOT APOLOGIZE for having reminders to do basic things like charge your phone, use the bathroom, or bathe every once in awhile. I even have reminders to check in on my mom from time to time (i.e. reminders to be a decent human being). Loved this article. Fong Yang I'm also a heavy user of reminders and I see the same problems. I hope Google fixes this soon. bekifft You're not alone, I would have written almost exactly this article if I could find the words. I've come to most of the same conclusions you have. Keep is by far the best way to handle reminders through Google, as it's the only one that lets you specify an arbitrary location at which to be reminded. The reason reminders haven't been added to Google Home yet is likely precisely because of this mess. God only knows what it looks like on the back end. Andrey Balandin You're very right in pointing out these deficiencies and I totally support that the experience is inconsistent. However, to be fair you are not using the right view in the calendar for your purposes. There is value in having one app which can show you all of the reminders created by all different methods together with other events and calendar is a good place for this, isn't it? To avoid this cluttered look which makes the calendar unusable you should just switch to schedule view. YuCMi You forget that Google's business strategy is to have clones of each of their products. Rob It's worth adding that you can only add a reminder using the Google app if you have Google Now cards activated (I don't, because I find it otherwise useless).

Alphabet, Google’s parent company, saw its “other revenues” hit nearly $3.1 billion in the first quarter, a gain of about 50% from the same quarter a year earlier. The segment includes sales from newer Google product categories like hardware, cloud services and the Google Play store. Alphabet sales from its moonshots projects like Fiber and Nest also grew to $244 million in the quarter, up from $165 million a year earlier. However, Google’s loss for these ambitious projects ticked up slightly to $855 million. Of course, the vast majority of Google’s revenue still comes from its core advertising business, which accounted for $21.4 billion of Alphabet’s $24.8 billion in overall sales. In a founders’ letter published earlier Thursday, Google cofounder Larry Page suggested the company has gotten better at developing its newer business ventures in the nearly two years since restructuring as Alphabet. “I… think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success,” he wrote in the letter. In December, Google spun off its self-driving car program into a separate business called Waymo. Google has also cut staff from its high-speed Internet service and recently brought on a new CEO. Google stock has soared this year, pushing the company’s market cap above $600 billion this week for the first time. But there are lingering concerns about the fallout from an advertiser boycott over offensive YouTube content. Some analysts estimate the financial hit to Google could be as much as $500 million — a significant sum, but a small amount relative to Google’s overall sales. Martin Utreras, an analyst with eMarketer, said the boycott was unlikely to affect the first quarter earnings, given the controversy kicked off late in the quarter. “However, with YouTube as a core driver of ad growth, we expect Google to quickly contain and address YouTube’s issues in order to maintain growth expectations for the year,” Utreras said in a statement.

Me, myself, my brand. James/Flickr Adresse e-mail Twitter Facebook Linkedin WhatsApp Messenger While self-portraiture is nearly as old as art itself, the photographic selfie emerged as a globally recognized phenomenon only recently, as a result of the rising “attention economy” and its growing appetite for likes, followers, retweets and fame. Google estimates some 24 billion selfies were taken in a year via 200 million Google accounts alone, which signals that the phenomenon far from being marginal. Selfies can be taken by virtually anyone, and companies and brands have recognized the magnetic “power” in making a selfie a key element of marketing campaigns and social-media content strategies. Yet brands are increasingly aware – and often uncomfortably so – that individuals’ selfies constitute a whole new form of brand co-creation. Based on my research, I will examine how people use “brand selfies” to express their identities as complex assemblages of things, objects, and brands and how that engenders new challenges for branding. Selfies and self-portraiture in historical perspective The selfie phenomenon has important connections with the idea of self-portraits in fine arts that emerged in the 16th Century. Already classic works of artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt, for example, featured paintings, engravings and drawings of the artist face-to-face with the spectator. These images often featured the artist “in action” in the artist’s studio, usually holding the pencils, brushes and colour palette in hand, in order to give the impression that the image was spontaneous and authentic in nature. But it was also not uncommon to these early self-portraits that the artist posed in fine clothing and staged apparel, or that he was playfully engaging with various image genres of the time. For instance, self-portraits were often fused with historical scenes or even still-life images. The self-portrait shares much in common with the visual genre called “snapshot aesthetic”, commonly in use in photography and commercial images, and not least in ads. Snapshot relies on the authentic feeling of images snapped “on the go” of our daily lives. As described by Iqani and Schroeder (2015), these casual, everyday images helps us narrate and make sense of our selves but also communicate our existence to those around us. When examined in the light of broader history of self-portraiture and photography it becomes quickly clear that classifying and pathologising selfies as simple acts of narcissism and ego-play would overlook important critical commentaries and reflexivity that this visual form potentially offers. Notably, many famous self-portraits have sought out for representational agency in order to make visible issues related to power and politics, including gender, as explained by art historian Derek Murray (2015). Yet it is important to keep in mind that the self-portrait and selfie differ in several respects. For one, self-portraits were historically rare and usually produced by the elite and the celebrated. It was not until the boom of popular photography around the turn of 20th Century that it was democratised as a key genre of image making. And it was the rise of smartphones and easy online access that made selfie an everyday and ever-present spectacle and practice. Selfies and the rise of attention economy The emergence of selfie phenomenon can be partly explained by peoples’ increasingly important drive for attentional capital in the forms of quantifiable likes, shares and followers. The selfie is a symptom of the attention economy, as it draws on intimate and sometimes revealing images in a magnet-like manner. As a result, “instafame” has allured celebrities and stars, rappers and gangsters, presidents and popes to take selfies, but they are not reserved just for the elite. More than 296,417,695 images have been tagged in Instagram alone, when writing this article, suggesting that selfies can be found in just about everyone’s social media profiles. Research by Eagar and Dann (2016) identifies selfies as an important “self-branding” practice. They also point out various kinds of popular selfies that proliferate quickly, including autobiography, parody, propaganda, romance, self-help, travel, and the coffee-table-and-book selfies. Other ubiquitous trends include selfies at the gym, toilet, funeral, museum, swimming pool, in front of mirror, or alongside luxury or other objects, or while wearing a hijab – and with or without a selfie-stick. Yet emerging research has found that selfies are not only the product of narcissism but they also may entail a feeling of being in control of one’s own expression as well as empowerment. Selfies have been considered as potent ways for negotiating one’s identity-related tensions, such those related to body ideals, gender, ethnicity, sexuality or religion – or even ways to combat censorship in countries with limited freedom of speech. Selfies have also been recognized as a powerful cultural form because of their ability to transcend linguistic and cultural boundaries. Brand selfies and consumer microcelebrity New digital technologies are evidently changing the ways in which meanings and identity of both consumers and brands are constructed. This is why, in my ongoing research on champagne, I decided to study how consumers post selfies featuring some of the most popular champagne brands. By means of visual analysis of consumer-made selfies on champagne brand Instagram accounts, I was able to uncover some key dynamics that explain how the brand selfies impact and potentially contest even well-established brands, such as Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon, or Veuve Clicquot, the three most talked-about champagne brands online in my data. A total of 6,820 images were gathered during six weeks in April/May 2014, from which a random sample of 120 images were analysed in detail. The objective was to compare how brand account images differ from consumer-made selfie-images, which constituted as much as 40% of all brand-tagged images, to illuminate their distinct nature. It became quickly clear that the studied brand-controlled accounts did not use selfies in their visual communications, and even the presence of people (only 25% of images on average) or faces (13%) was rare. Instead, the brands’ postings often echoed typical champagne advertising images depicting a “still life” of inanimate objects, artefacts and scenery mainly focused on the product close-up – including the brand logo (75%), bottle(s) (63%), wine (25%), and bubbles (13%). They also ensured, as one might imagine, that no other brands were present or identifiable. All attention was reserved for the focal champagne brand and its principal, historically shaped associations that most often included “heritage/tradition” (55%), “class/status” (45%), and even “magic” (22%) (see figure 1). Figure 1: Champagne brands expressed in Instagram brand accounts. Maria Federley Consumers’ brand selfies presented sharp and visible contrast to these “official” brand images. While the appearance of bottles, wine and bubbles in selfie-images was as frequent as in the brand images, they presented a large number of human bodies (95% of selfie images and 1.5 people per image on average), with as many as 53% of the images featuring face(s). This shift in focus impacts the overall feeling of the images in significant ways. Notably, the presence of human bodies and identifiable faces break the brand’s singularity and gives it an often banalized expression. In addition, consumers’ brand selfies were not focused on a single champagne brand, but nearly 40% of the images contained or tagged several brands at once. Instead of being focused on the brand, the selfies were systematically centred on the “self”, making the brand necessarily more peripheral (see Figure 2). More often than not, the brand was only mentioned with a hashtag in textual commentary but not visible in the image. Figure 2: Brand selfies of various kinds. Maria Federley What emerges from the consumers’ brand selfies is an incontestable expression of what I call “microcelebrity”. This highly popular category, constituting 67% of all the consumer-made images, can be understood as a collection of visual practices and strategies that mimic celebrities’ postings aimed to signal fame and attractiveness to others. For example, common brand selfies entail “mirror selfies”, “gym selfies”, “bathroom selfies”, “bikini selfies”, and “party selfies”, in other words, “ordinary” people posing as if they were famous stars. These postings commonly joined with follower and attention-seeking hashtags such as #follow4follow", #followme, #like4like and #pickoftheday (see Figure 3). Figure 3: Brand selfies and consumer celebrities. Maria Federley Above all, these findings reveal that selfies as a new form of visual self-presentation practice have come to offer alternative constructions of brands with new kinds of material and expressive features. Notably, they indicate that selfies (and the self) are becoming the nodal point at which official brand images and consumer microcelebrity assemblages intersect. This powerful shift potentially undermines stable, historically built symbolic and material properties of heritage brands, and makes visible a profound heterogeneity of alternative and often chaotic brand images – at least from the point of view of the brand manager. New challenges for branding Companies and marketing scholars have long understood that social media have accelerated processes of brand co-creation with customers. Yet very often this phenomenon has been considered only in terms of online consumer-to-brand or consumer-to-consumer verbal dialogues or narratives – hence, word-of-mouth – leaving the visual aspects aside. New forms of visual practices, including the selfie, force the marketers to see and re-consider the visual dimension of their co-creation strategies. The problem is that until recently, most social-media monitoring tools base their analysis on text, not images or video. We thus seem to lack comprehensive tools and even vocabulary for addressing the arguably slippery, elusive but also excessive and voluminous visual. This makes the brand managers’ tasks increasingly difficult. Although experienced marketing professionals may have an intuitive understanding towards the visual, in my research I have hoped to offer more concrete approaches in this regard. Through visual content analysis of both official and consumer-made champagne Instagram images, I worked to understand the kinds of expressive and material assemblages of identities that the social media images construct. This allowed us to map out the focal elements that consumer-generated images – although most often arguably unintentionally – reinforce in the official brand expressions and meanings, and also those that effectively disrupt and destabilize them. For example, it was not uncommon that the studied official champagne brand accounts, and perhaps by accident, expressed symbolic and material elements in their postings that were largely in contradiction and dissonance, at least in terms of stylistic consistency, with their historically stabilized brand vision (for example, postings with “wrong” kinds of champagne glasses, or combining champagne with “wrong” kinds of subcultural symbols). How can companies manage brand co-creation through selfies? Despite the above-described challenges, I believe that powerfully resonant, charismatic, and meaningful brands can always play an important role in leading the creative production of social-media images and interactions. On a practical level, this could simply mean campaigns where brands teach people to take “desired” types of images with the “right” types of expressive and material ingredients. However, the question at stake is more fundamental: a contemporary brand can no longer rely on strategies that follow a logic that aims to “control” and “own” every association and aspect about their brand. Instead, they need to embrace a whole new conception of a brand which is more “open source” by default. This means that successful brands need to allow for more diversity and flexibility in the expressions and meanings that “fit” it. An excellent example is the GoPro brand that relies exclusively on consumer-created visual communications across all of their (official) communications. In a similar manner, successful brands will need to relinquish control – at least in a much greater degree – to gain resonance with the selfie-obsessed social media world.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | April 27, 2017 -- 20:26 GMT (13:26 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Google parent company Alphabet reported first quarter financial results Thursday that came in above estimates. The tech giant reported non-GAAP earnings were $7.73 per share on a revenue of $24.8 billion, up 22 percent year-over-year, when including traffic acquisition costs (TAC). must read Digital transformation: Making it work in the real world It takes more than shiny new technologies to remake business processes. Here are a few ideas on how to make digital transformation projects work in your organisation. Read More Wall Street was looking for earnings of $7.40 per share with $24.2 billion in revenue. Net revenue excluding TAC was expected to be $19.81 billion. Alphabet delivered $20.17 billion in revenue excluding TAC. Net income was $5.43 billion. Google revenues made up the bulk of Q1 sales with $24.5 billion in revenue, down slightly from $25.8 billion the previous quarter. The Google umbrella covers the company's enterprise cloud, software and data management products. The biggest contributor was mobile growth, said Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat. Porat also said the Google cloud platform is one of fasted growing businesses across Alphabet. The company's total advertising revenue was $21.4 billion. Aggregate cost-per-click fell 19 percent, but aggregate paid clicks were up 44 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago. In the Other Bets category, which houses Waymo, Nest, Fiber, Alphabet's healthcare-driven initiatives and other speculative projects, Alphabet posted revenue of $244 million over the quarter, with operating losses of $855 million. Last quarter, losses in this category totaled $1.1 billion. Porat said Nest, Verily and Fiber drove most of the Other Bets revenue in Q1. On the conference call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai once again highlighted the company's work around machine learning and artificial intelligence. "Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better," Pichai said. "We continue to set the pace in machine learning and AI usage." Looking forward toward the second quarter, Wall Street is expecting non-GAAP earnings of $8.05 per share with $25.3 billion in revenue.

How to customize Chrome's terrible New Tab page Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:02am PDTApr 27, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications News Article Contents 1 Removing suggested content 2 Removing recent downloads and offline pages 3 Removing recently-visited bookmarks 4 Show tabs from other devices 5 Turning on the condensed layout 6 Switching to the Chrome Home interface Back in Chrome 54, Google replaced Chrome for Android's New Tab page with a new design that prominently featured suggested content - much like Google Now's feed. To quote Douglas Adams, "This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. If you're not a fan of Chrome's cluttered New Tab page, there are a few workarounds you can try to make it a bit more usable. You can even mix and match features to create a more personalized design. The below workarounds require enabling or disabling Chrome flags. To do this, navigate to "chrome://flags" (without the quotes), press the menu icon, select 'Find in page,' and type the name of the flag starting with the hashtag symbol. Removing suggested content Removing the suggested articles list is pretty simple. Find the #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Once you do that and re-open Chrome, the list will no longer appear on the New Tab page. Removing recent downloads and offline pages The New Tab page also shows recent file downloads by default, but this is fairly easy to remove as well. Find the #enable-ntp-asset-download-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Then make sure you re-launch Chrome, and it should be gone. In addition, pages you have saved for offline reading show up on the New Tab page. If you want, you can turn this off by disabling #enable-ntp-offline-page-download-suggestions. Removing recently-visited bookmarks By default, Chrome shows bookmarks you have recently visited on the New Tab page. This can also be turned off by disabling the #enable-ntp-bookmark-suggestions flag. Show tabs from other devices As you may know, Chrome syncs your open tabs across your devices, so you can easily pick up from where you left off. There is a hidden flag that adds a 'Tabs from other devices' section to the New Tab Page. The only catch is that suggested articles has to also be turned on, which is a bit of a bummer. To turn it on, make sure both #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions and #enable-ntp-foreign-sessions-suggestions are set to Enabled. Then, reopen Chrome, and your tabs from other devices should appear. Turning on the condensed layout If you do like the suggested content or other features on the page, you still might want to turn on the condensed New Tab page layout. This removes the large space at the top, where the Google logo normally sits, allowing for more content to be visible without scrolling.   Left: Condensed design disabled, Right: Condensed design enabled To turn on the condensed layout, simply enable the #ntp-condensed-layout flag and re-launch Chrome. This is already enabled by default in Chrome Dev, at least on my device, so it may come to Chrome stable in the near future. Switching to the Chrome Home interface Chrome is constantly changing, and there's already another revamp of the New Tab page interface in development. It's called Chrome Home, and it moves the address bar to the bottom of the screen. With this new layout, the New Tab page is accessible by swiping up from the address bar, and it includes navigation icons for Downloads, Bookmarks, and History.    This new design only works on Chrome Dev and Canary for now. To try it out, switch #enable-chrome-home and #ntp-google-g-in-omnibox to Enabled and re-open Chrome. There you have it - a few tips to make Chrome's New Tab page less awful. Let us know in the comments if you have any suggestions we didn't mention. Tags chrome chrome 58 chrome home chrome new tab page chrome ntp new tab page ntp subscribe ...

George at this rate, They need an 'Of The Hour' section... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Switching what the Bixby button does was possible with an app, but the recent update removes this ability. Nerds go apoplectic with rage against Samsung. Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. No outrage yet. Corbin Davenport Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ An EXTRA button, i.e., a button other phones don't even have. Does Samsung have a good reason for locking it into Bixby? It's too early to tell. Shaun39 You should put a sarcasm tag at the end of your clueless comments. EcE An EXTRA button many people reportedly have been pressing accidentally more often than trying to use it. MadMartigan Bingo. They could at least have put it on the other side. As it is, 100% of the time I hit I am trying to turn the volume down. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You'll never admit it, but I guarantee you'd be complaining no matter where they put the button. MadMartigan I think you may be having some trouble reading for comprehension. I'll gladly admit it, as it has been my point all along. Not a fan of Bixby. Not a fan of the button placement. Wouldn't mind at least being able to remap it to make it at least marginally useful rather than just simply in the way. They put the button in a very bad place. Adding insult to injury - they have now disallowed making it at all useful to anyone not inexplicably fond of Bixby. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does. Also, if they put it on the right, I guarantee people would still complain about accidentally pressing it. In other words, you guys will complain about anything as long as it's Samsung. EcE The point you are missing, is the comment you are replying to: "Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change." Having that button which you could be able to disable if Samsung weren't dicks, is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people don't even have yet. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! The nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. EcE Because when someone found a way to change it's behavior, Samsung quickly blocked it. An extra hardware button is more annoying than a home page you can just ignore, period. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And you can use another browser. Nobody's forcing you to use Chrome. You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it. Or just buy a phone without an extra button. That'll show Samsung. Same difference. MadMartigan "You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it." Proof positive you just straight up refuse to understand that the placement is a problem for some people. "Just not pressing it" is not as simple as you seem to want to make it sound. I've accidentally launched it several times trying to lower the volume on the 8+ and I can only imagine it would be even worse on the S8. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Proof positive you're just a whiny baby. I've accidentally pressed the volume button many times when trying to press the power button, because my hand grabs both sides of the phone to get the leverage to press the power button. As much as it may amaze you to hear this, I survive this heart-rending inconvenience. MadMartigan God forbid anyone express an opinion that doesn't cast Samsung in the best possible light... /s MadMartigan ..and you nerd rage against anyone who thinks it might not be the best thing ever, can we talk about that, maybe? You know, since we're apparently not allowed to discuss the possibility that they might have handled it better? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You implied that the lack of complaints was because Chrome 58 is still rolling out. I pointed out that the nerd rage about the button occurred before people got their phones, thus nullifying your point. Discuss anything you want. MadMartigan Except any possibility that Samsung could have done something better. Apparently we're not allowed to do that without being called names... MadMartigan "If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does." So a bad key placement could not be made at least marginally better by allowing to map to something you might actually someday use... Got it. Your logic is flawless... /s Necdet Ali Özdür How come people don't press other buttons accidentally but​ somehow keep pressing Bixby button all the time? EcE Who said that? Necdet Ali Özdür ... you? EcE Oh yeah? I said: "Bixby is the only button people press accidentally" ... I'm sure I did. and btw, HTC's power button just below the volume buttons is/was (HTC 9/10 and whichever else they did the same) something to complain about as well. Either way, the point here is that having an extra button that cannot be disabled/remapped is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people have not seen yet. Necdet Ali Özdür That doesn't mean those people won't see it, I guess that's the point you are missing. Both decisions can be reversed by respective parties by means of a software update, but people (especially here in Android Police) complain about Samsung the most. EcE Nah, I think we enjoy bi+ching about everything Necdet Ali Özdür Who doesn't? 😂 MadMartigan Possibly due to it's bad placement. Have you been paying attention? Necdet Ali Özdür It's placed where a button could be placed on an all screen phone. Like the rest of them it's on the side. MadMartigan So there's no other place they could have put it? Really? I hope you're actually trying to be dense... Do phones you use not have tops, bottoms, or right sides? Do they have no room at all below where the button is currently placed on the left? Necdet Ali Özdür I hope that next phone you own will have a power button on the bottom and volume buttons on the top. Because those are valid positions to place buttons. Yeah. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It doesn't matter where the buttons are. If it's a Samsung phone, at least 75% of AP commenters will be outraged. MadMartigan ...and the one fanboy will attempt to shout down anyone with a valid opinion regarding how it could have been better. Because to him, Sammy can do no wrong. FWIW: I have not owned a Samsung since the S2 and as this was the first one without the ridiculous home button, I jumped at it. I like pretty much *everything* about the device other than the absurd Bixby-button. MadMartigan lmao. Are you being serious? HTC had power buttons on the top - never once accidentally powered it off. You really cannot accept that the placement may not be optimal for some people? That this is the only place they could have put it? Necdet Ali Özdür It's in a place where majority of current devices have their buttons. Sounds more optimal to me than the places you've suggested. Some people may not like to have it at that place, or not have that extra button at all. But in my opinion it is the best place to place Samsung could've put it. MadMartigan So the right side, where there is currently only one button, would be a worse place for it? They couldn't texture the power button and have the bixby button 1/2 inch below it? That wouldn't be better than the same texture as the volume keys, and right next to them? I mean heck, even if they'd just added a texture to it...that would have been better. Necdet Ali Özdür It is significantly smaller than the volume button (which is a rocker now) which makes it easy to differentiate with a finger. But yeah a texture wouldn't hurt. I agree you on this one. But if it was on the right side, I'm pretty sure people would still complain as much as they do now, claiming they're confusing it with the power button and such. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're complaining because it's a Samsung phone. If this was a button on the Pixel, it could be in the worst possible location and they'd go to the ends of the earth to defend it. MadMartigan Honestly, I would have loved it on the right, in a perfect location to be hit by the finger right above the pinky when needed. Power-index, Bixby two fingers down. Would have, IMO, been perfect. Could have even gone without the texture on that one. Where it is now, you're going after it with your thumb. Until muscle-memory kicks in, it's a crap-shoot where it's going to land initially and unless you expect to have to double-check, you're going in to press - and could easily press the wrong one. It's all personal preference, to be sure, but I do believe they could have appeased far more people by putting it on the right. FWIW - the same complain was leveled at HTC when they placed the power/volume buttons on the same side, though I do not believe the volume was a rocker on that model. Could have been done better. My favorite device was actually the One M7 - which had the power-button on the top. Power-top, volume-right, nothing on the left. Zero possibility of confusion. (Power on the back would have been fine as well - V20 nailed the fingerprint sensor/power on that one.) bekifft There is no good reason for locking hardware functionality away from the user. Don't give them a pass on taking more control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ As I say below, the nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. This isn't about timing. It's about Google love vs. Samsung hate. MadMartigan Wow. Someone's triggered... Tiuri Elvander I was and am still outraged. Have been since this came up in the review of 58 Beta Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, so far, that makes one of you, vs. the dozens of people who went into a nerd rage about the Bixby button, many of whom don't even have or want the phone. MJ I don't use Chrome a lot to care enough to disable the new tab page crap but why would Google stop users from customizing it? I can do that with Firefox... Address bar at the bottom of the screen? WTF? Michel Sa Address bar at the bottom makes a lot more sense on a mobile phone. Renan In a mobile phone, having the address bar at the bottom of the screen makes a lot of sense MJ No... ipsofact yes... MJ How have I been able to use the address bar on my phone at the top all this time? EcE Magic? ipsofact we never said you could not use the address bar on your phone. But on mobile its a lot quicker and pain free to have it at the bottom. Unless you want to stretch your thumb all the time. MJ Come on... Are you a human? When I hold my phone my thumb is already naturally pointing toward the top of my phone so would need to stretch it to make it to the bottom. Regardless, I happen to have nine other fingers and the on-screen keyboard pops up in the same place anyway. I have been using the address bar at the top of browsers for over 20 years now so don't need to be changing my workflow habits now and just on my phone on top of it. ipsofact typical ive been doing this for 20 years so I wont change the way I work. You know I work with several people with the same mentality.. I have been using the address bar at the top since day 1 but today I changed it to the bottom. Works great and believe me I won't let the old "ive been doing it like this for years" ever stop me. Or just put the phone upside down. it works ;) MJ Change is not the issue... It's change for no good reason or benefit. At least give the user control to change it back. Some unknown God(s) at Google one day just deciding the address bar will now go at the bottom is ridiculous. Microsoft tried that crap on a larger scale with Windows 8. How did that work out for them? ipsofact You can change it back and forth. Its up to the user to decide. So we are not being obligated to do anything. Just given options! :) Which I like. I can decide the whether the bar will go up the top or the bottom. MJ What? LOL The whole article is about Google not allowing users to disable the crap on new tabs. Thanks for your input and have a good day. MadMartigan "It's change for no good reason or benefit." Thankfully, your refusal to see the reason or benefit does not affect the ability of anyone else to. MadMartigan He said it made sense on the bottom - not that it wasn't unusable on the top. Reading is fundamental. FeelThePoveR It depends on the usage. Sometimes I press my hardware buttons accidentally when doing the swipe up gesture on the bottom adress bar in chrome (closing the tab/app or whatever). I'm still loving it though. MadMartigan People still use mobile Firefox?? ipsofact Firefox still use mobile people? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Except for Android and the Play Store (and their dependencies), I'm off all Google apps. I'm sick of the constant BS coming out of Google. I use Dolphin as my browser. If I get frustrated with Android enough, I'll just give up my precious S Pen and give an iPhone a chance. MadMartigan I loved that change and wish they'd bring it to desktop Chrome. Would love a "Google Now" start-page on the desktop. Kieron Quinn I've used iChrome as a Google Now-esque NTP for a while, it used to be a lot better (especially when it actually got Google Now cards via a hidden API) but is slowly getting worse: http://i.imgur.com/vfO7Kfq.png TomsDisqusted The suggested content is all the worst possible sources of news on the internet - I guess those are the ones that have the most advertising revenue per view - so I'm glad to see there is a way to get rid of it. It would be better though if Google would simply show me news from the sources that I actually use! Tiuri Elvander I disabled the suggestions and they were indeed gone. Instead I got some annoying round image with some text saying "that's all for now. More articles will appear soon." Uninstalled 58 and installed 57 again. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions isn't available in mine, so I can't turn on Recent Tabs like I'd like to... cgrant There are apps that will do this without all the fuss. Try TabMark. deepdvd That's a Chrome extension, not a mobile app. Try again? pfmiller I think the easiest solution is just to stick with Chrome 57 until Google fixes this mess. Peter I want my bookmarks back on the New Tab Page, or at least a link to them. Having to open the menu to get to the bookmarks is a pain when trying to open lots. bekifft Thank you for this article. This is just further encouraging my use of Brave. Not a big fan of the name, though.

Capitalizing on consumers’ shift toward handsets and away from laptops, Google crammed more ads into mobile search results, including new lucrative shopping spots, while running more promotions on its Maps app. The result: Parent Alphabet Inc. beat analysts’ sales projections in the first quarter, ending a four-year streak of missing Wall Street estimates after the holidays. Revenue in the most-recent quarter, minus payouts to partners, rose to $20.12 billion, above projections of $19.76 billion. Net income was $7.73 a share, easily beating analysts’ estimates, helped by cost controls at some of the companies moonshot projects. Company shares rose as much as 5.2 percent to $938.18 in extended trading. The stock closed at a record earlier on Thursday in New York. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Along with mobile ads, Alphabet executives cited the growth of YouTube ads as a key driver. Major marketers paused spending recently on the video site over concern about ads running beside offensive content, but this probably had little effect on first-quarter results because it began less than two weeks before the period ended. And the boycott didn’t include search ads, the bulk of Google’s business.  Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said the company will continued to invest in technological fixes for the YouTube issue, but assured investors the problem was under control. "Advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made," he said on a conference call with analysts. "Our conversations with them are very, very positive." Analysts were reassured by Pichai’s comments and the company’s results. "Bottom line, fears over demand drop-off from YouTube [were] alleviated," said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. Another factor that investors may cheer came from continued cost controls at Alphabet’s most audacious projects. The company cut spending on its Other Bets units -- the non-Google businesses that include its self-driving car company, Waymo. Expenditures on those divisions totaled $170 million during the quarter, down 39 percent from a year earlier. Alphabet spent more than 14 times that amount on Google. Other Bets operating losses narrowed from the prior quarter, mainly from a pullback by the company’s Fiber broadband service. Last year, it dramatically cut back on the once-ambitious effort. On the earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said some Fiber staff were reallocated to Google. In a letter to shareholders before Alphabet’s earnings, Chief Executive Officer Larry Page highlighted the recent progress of the self-driving car business, saying he "can’t wait until Waymo launches." Page also noted "significant investments" to expand Fiber and expressed excitement about "opportunities to do it better" -- a nod to the efficiency drive at the broadband business.

The numbers looked stunning for Google and Facebook, not so rosy for everyone else. The two tech giants accounted for more than three-quarters of all the growth across the industry. And that momentum showed up today in Alphabet’s first quarter earnings. Revenue at Google, which comes from things like search ads, display ads, and advertising on YouTube videos, came in at $24.75 billion, a 22 percent jump from the same period last year. Net profit was $5.42 billion, a 29 percent gain from the first quarter of 2016. The stock price climbed to new highs on the strength of this report, trading up about 3 percent after hours. YouTube had a rocky quarter in the press after reports surfaced about offensive video content being presented next to marketing from major brands. If there was any negative impact on Google’s business from the advertiser boycott that began in March, however, it didn’t show up in today’s earnings. Alphabet lumps the rest of its financials into a category called “other bets.” This bucket covers moon shots like internet access beamed down by balloons, self-driving cars, and energy-producing kites. In a statement to investors, Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, said, “We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet." The numbers from this quarter, however, don’t back this statement up very strongly. This group collected $244 million in revenue, a 48 percent increase from the same period last year, but overall stuck Alphabet with an $855 million loss — no surprise given these are still largely R&D projects without clear business models.

Google (goog) is pushing hard to attract software developers to use its infrastructure to build and deploy thei applications. Several sources confirmed Teich's move and that he will work under Sam Ramji, vice president of product for Google's cloud business. Google declined to comment. From 2009 to 2014, Teich was at Heroku, rising to become chief operating officer and general manager, according to his LinkedIn profile. Salesforce(crm) bought Heroku for $212 million in 2010. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Teich left Salesforce in 2014 to start Canvas, a company that built a collaborative word processing application. Canvas stopped taking new customers last year. Max Schoening, Teich's Canvas co-founder and Heroku colleague, has also joined Google, sources said. One source close to Teich said he will help run Google App Engine (GAE), a Heroku-like development environment running on Google infrastructure. Google's cloud effort, overseen by senior vice president Diane Greene, faces two very tough and well-funded rivals in market leader Amazon (amzn) Web Services and No. 2 Microsoft (msft) Azure. The more Google can do to woo and retain software developers as customers, the more traction it will get with its business-focused products.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 106 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares203 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezelless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen-to-body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8 or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold on to it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that are specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on your phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode. Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is an all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart MJ Yeah, it's just horrible here so don't believe anything you hear and certainly don't waste your time immigrating here. likurges believe me, the us is towards the bottom of my list of countries that I'd want to migrate to. and now that you hurt my feeling I'm going to get them checked for free because you know .. single payer healthcare is a thing in the modern world MJ Dude, why do you keep advertising on the Internet how bad it in the US? I wouldn't want my fellow citizens to figure it out also thus ruining your future increases in elbow room in your own country. Worse, you could end up a out terrorist watchlist and then Donald drone strikes your ass. I wouldn't take the chance man! Single payer? Sweet! That's almost worth exchanging for having any real professional sports. I am BLOCKING you now. All bets in on if the troll responds again! likurges dude freedom of speech, have you ever heard of it? blocking people you don't like makes you similar to The Donald whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. Liam Bulkley I know the "2.5D" (are they still calling it that?) is, thus far, largely a gimmick, and effectively reduces the reading width due to distortions, but the front of the s8/+ looks gorgeous. All that glass..... Nope. Bad! Metal would be better, but a nice high quality plastic would be best. Is Samsung in the pocket of Big Glass? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ My son just got his S8+ and the white is white as snow. The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe it is a defect, I don't know. If I got a pink one, I'd return it. I wouldn't accept a software update. I'm also wondering if at least some of the people who think they have pink displays simply have the blue filter turned on. 4Ui812 The blue filter shouldn't be causing that sort of issue. Hell the blue filter on my s7e doesn't make that much of a difference. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. Liam Bulkley "...one would expect, but that turns out not to be the case on this device" :-D godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Liam Bulkley Mostly. iPhones stutter as well. They do still have the best touch latency, though. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. blairh It absolutely can. Corner to corner diagonally it's 6". Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? blairh Being critical has levels. Reviewers are not being harsh enough regarding this you prick. tim242 Yes they are. Now, you are a blocked prick. blairh You are such a loser. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½.

Google's new search tools and changes could help combat fake news Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 10:37am PDTApr 25, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares113 Google News Since time immemorial (1998) Google's bread, butter, and raison d'être has been search. Now Google's changing the way search works a bit, empowering users by adding new feedback tools and changing results from their search ranking to bring you more relevant and accurate information. With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. F4LL0U7 However, PEOPLE can choose to march for or against a cause. These people were marching *against* decisions made by the government that seem to ignore scientific research, and *for* awareness of the cause. And science can certainly favor one policy or another. For example, cutting the EPA by 30% and removing regulations that protect the environment -- it's pretty safe to say that if you consider scientific research, you would not make those decisions. Nicholas Conrad No, that's the problem. Using your personal political views as a proxy for pro/anti science is *very* anti science. F4LL0U7 Ok I'll bite. If that's the case, then what scientific arguments are there that defend the deregulation of industries that create the most pollution and damage to the environment? I'll offer my own take on it, and absolutely feel free to counter. The current administration takes the stance that those industries *don't* harm the environment significantly. They believe the harm done is outweighed by the boost they predict to employment, the economy, and their own profits. I can cite Trump's Earth Day tweets as an example of this stance. In taking that stance, they are either ignoring scientific evidence of harm to the environment, or choosing to diminish its value. That is an anti-science stance, and one of the many reasons these people marched that day. Scientists are telling the world that certain things are major priorities right now and require immediate action. When politicians ignore or deprioritize scientific evidence for the sake of their own priorities, that is anti-science. Nicholas Conrad Why is it a given that the epa is optimal at it's current funding levels, do you have evidence, or are you assuming because you like what they stand for? And trump isn't targeting the epa specifically, he's spoken out against the larger 'regulatory state'. It's perfectly coherent to argue that laws should be passed by congress, not unelected bureaucrats (working under the executive branch, bt-dubs, so shrinking the regulatory state actually diminishes trumps power while increasing democratic engagement in policy making... you'd think it was something we should all be able to get behind) even if there are some good ones on the books that will temporarily be displaced. But the real issue is your (and the marchers', and for that matter the general pubic's) confusion between the statements "science says" and "scientists say". It's a cheap *appeal to authority* fallacy, one which, when questioned about it scientists usually (very conveniently​) say 'well yes, but it doesn't count when *we*'re the authority'. Then you look at the structure of modern academic 'science', where advances in computer-aided statistical analysis, paired with clever research design allow researchers to almost guarantee a 'significant' result, which is important because their carriers depend on *publishing*, not on finding truth. So much so that a full 2/3rds of 'peer reviewed' studies don't hold up under replication. Science *is* self-correcting, but on the time scale of decades and centuries, not months and years, so whatever cause du jour is backed up by 'the latest studies' is most likely to be wrong. If people are really interested in supporting *science* they should be marching on campuses demanding more rigor in academic publishing standards which were established centuries ago, not marching for x or y policy, about which science is agnostic. F4LL0U7 I certainly respect your argument, and greatly appreciate your well thought out points (in stark contrast to the insult-spewing posts of some other commenters on here). But I respectfully disagree with you. The sentiment that laws should be passed by Congress and not unelected bureaucrats is sound. You can definitely make the claim that the Trump administration is advocating for deregulation for selfless reasons. But you seem like an intelligent person -- do you really believe that? Trump has not divested from his businesses, and his appointees and friends will directly benefit from deregulation. Isn't it much more likely that they care more about their profitability than the environment? You're discounting the validity of scientific research due to perceived flaws in the system (which is a reasonable thing to do), but failing to acknowledge the common sense that's so obvious when you follow the money. Humans have come to rely heavily on industries that pollute the environment. That pollution has very real negative effects on the environment. You can doubt the validity of that all you want -- those effects can be seen with your own eyes. (What do you think causes the smog in Beijing? Do you think it's nothing to worry about?) In order to stop and hopefully reverse some of that damage, those industries must be regulated. They certainly can't be trusted to regulate themselves. The US has it better than other countries, but can and should be a world leader on this front. The people invested most heavily in those polluting industries have the most to lose from regulation. Those people now have the ear of those in charge (and in many cases, actually are the ones in charge). They will continue to make decisions in the best interest of their industries, as opposed to the environment. That is how science gets politicized, and why scientific facts get challenged by people in these industries. Science should always be challenged and tested, but for purposes of advancement, and not spun for profit. Of course they're not going to come out and say it's for the benefit of their own bottom line. They're going to pay their own scientists to come up with research that supports their own agenda, and then lobby friendly politicians to vote in their favor. Have you ever wondered why cigarettes are still legal? Nicholas Conrad Look, reasonable people can disagree, or at least they used to be able to (I think we're doing a fine job). So your argument is: "trump likes corporate profits at the expense of the environment, and I like the environment at the expense of corporate profits". That's fine, I agree with you, but those are both preferences people can have and science doesn't take sides there. All science says is: 'one way the Earth will warm slower, the other way global wealth will rise slower.' Personally I think our grandchildren will be better equipped to deal with the consequences of global warming with a few extra trillion in global GDP than a few degrees Celsius shaved off the average global temperature. Those are trade-offs science can help define, but ultimately people can prefer different outcomes without being 'anti science'. Is trump a scumbag? Certainly. Is he an idiot? For sure. Does that mean that supporting the opposite of his views is inherently pro-science? Not remotely. As to your point about oil company studies that fossil fuels don't contribute to global warming, or tabacco company studies showing no link between cigarettes and cancer, because there's an inherent conflict of interest, I'd say you're right to be skeptical. Even with no funny business on the part of the scientists involved, we know that subtle factors (like who signs your paycheck) influences the outcome of research. Agreed? Good. Why then do we not examine the conflict of interests of government funded studies that consistently suggest the agency that funded them should have more power and funding? F4LL0U7 I'm definitely glad I don't have to convince you that climate change is real, or that Trump is a scumbag. We are different people with different values, with conflicting but equally valid ideas on how to achieve the best possible future. I agree that this is about as reasonable as a disagreement can be, especially in the comment section of a completely unrelated website. Just as you acknowledged the validity of my skepticism of paid studies that show certain industries in a better light, I'll also hand it to you that government agencies finding that they need more funding could be a conflict of interest as well. I would certainly hope that there is some sort of check/balance system to prevent abuse, but I honestly don't know enough about their operations to make that claim. I think we've just about exhausted this topic. We're not going to change each other's minds, but I don't think we need to (and I don't think that was either of our intentions either). However, I do have newfound respect for your side of this argument, and sincerely appreciate your well-reasoned, calm, and intelligent posts. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm sure we'll bump into each other again the next time @ryne_hager:disqus posts something vaguely political that the readers jump on! M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial. abc The controversy is that these morons think climate change is a Chinese hoax, and science (and frankly common sense) tell us that it's not. So controversy!! Sir_Brizz I don't know if there really is a controversy. However, I didn't find many of the signs people were holding to be very pro-Science even though they presumed to be. It kind of snipes any "movement" when there isn't really a consistent message and people are undermining it by their own stupidity. Nicholas Conrad Clearly a media conspiracy; is mj lamestream? MJ The first of the manipulated BLOCKED! This is NOT a free speech issue so I would suggest a First Amendment 101 class. cooldude5500 Man I loved to search something weird for the predictions so that I could see the most outrageous thing that people were searching for.

David Warthen We must get rid of the fake news so you can be inundated with all the real news that's completely made up. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 Hahah, thanks! Where were you? Your body was ready, and we needed you! Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I had meetings all day and kind of forgot since all the responses came off your comment and not mine so I got no emails! F4LL0U7 Haha, I'm just kidding. I do it to myself -- I enjoy it! Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Reading over everything really just wants me to respond to some of the comments but I know it'd be futile. Alas. Branko Actually the world is X and Y. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ K. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Branko Homosexuals aren't suicidial. They also don't police people's speech, because they're not inventing sexes. Branko Trans people need psychiatric help, that's why a lot of them contemplate suicide even though they went through all the procedures. Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. Si vis pacem, para bellum So, you believe in Evolution right? What about talking about races then, is it OK or are races "a social construct"..? Assuming you believe in the existence of races, are we all physically and mentally equal? What are the differences, both physically *and mentally*, between the races? You say you believe in science and you also say that there is nothing wrong in the Social Justice agenda. The 2 are just as incompatible as science and believing in Biblical literalism. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Si vis pacem, para bellum "Most languages"..? Which are all of these many languages..? To my knowledge it's English that has a gender neutral pronoun ("it"), in my mother tongue, Italian, and in the others derived from Latin like the French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian languages, *everything* has either a male or female gender. For example a chair is female, a table male, the language is male, a word female... Also, the ZW chromosomal system is only for birds and some fish and insects, there are only 2 sex chromosomes in humans and the other mammals and you correctly call chromosomal *anomalies* (which are also very rare) any combination which doesn't produce either a male or a female. A person born with 3 legs does not mean that the human species has either 2 or 3 legs... abc Sure. Let's face it you're too stupid to know what a chromosome is. So let's stick to fixing tires . Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise? abc lol. Google hermaphrodites. I love when a moron claims science backs up his opinion, when it's so obvious to a 5th grade science student that you're a numbskull. Branko There are people being born with 3 arms. Humans still have two. Unless you idiots want to change that too because "oppression stack".

Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's one thing to think differently, it's another to spread false information. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! F4LL0U7 If that's how you're using Google, you're doing it wrong. Google filters out suggestions tying a person's name to crimes and obscenity. This was all over tech news a year ago. I would expect Bruce Wayne to be on top of things like this. If you don't like Google's search results, use a different search engine. Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus. Stormprobe But Google is a liberal company, so they are for fake news. Teppka You do not need Google to protect yourself from fake news. Just stop watching-reading CNN, BBC and other neocon-controlled media.

Digital Trends Home > Photography > Smartphones suck at low-light photos, but the… Smartphones suck at low-light photos, but the right software could fix that By Hillary Grigonis — April 27, 2017 10:43 AM Subscribe Share Florian Kainz / Google Research Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Smartphones are notoriously bad at low light, but a Google engineer just shot what could be the most detailed low-light smartphone photos yet. When the average person accepts a dare, the result may range anywhere from a few stitches to some embarrassing photos. But when a Google software engineer accepts a challenge, the result might just be a solution that solves a common problem. After Florian Kainz, of Google Research’s Gcam team, showed his co-workers a night landscape he’d shot with a DSLR, he was challenged to take the same photo, but with a smartphone. The result? A peek at a shooting and editing process, which he documented in a Google blog post, could eventually wind up in future Google smartphones, like the Pixel. Kainz took inspiration from the HDR+ mode that combines multiple smartphone photos for better quality, as well as SeeInTheDark, an experimental app that produces low-light images by merging photos and dropping the resolution to a single megapixel. Using similar multiple-shot techniques, Kainz set out to see if he could shoot a photo in the dark but without the noisy images from SeeInTheDark or the limitations of HDR+. He decided to use a similar bracketing method of merging multiple photos together to get better – and brighter – results. Unlike the automatic HDR+ feature, he merged long exposures instead of images taken at a tenth of a second, using the smartphone’s longest available shutter speed (four seconds for the Nexus 6P and two seconds for the Pixel). The longer exposures would be brighter and merging multiple brighter photos would produce better results, he theorized. But first, he had to tackle the challenges all cameras face in the dark: focusing. Cameras need light to focus, which means even DSLR users need to switch to manual focus to shoot at night. Kainz then had to program an app that allows the camera’s focus to be manually set. For landscape photos, setting the camera’s focus at infinity worked for most of the subjects he shot, he wrote. The app also allowed him to control the shutter speed and ISO, as well as shooting in DNG, a type of digital negative with more control over the editing process. Manual camera apps aren’t anything new, but Kainz’s experimental app also shot up to 64 single photos with one press of the shutter button – over six times the maximum ten frames the HDR+ will capture. To test the app, he shot at a number of locations during the light of a full moon as well as nights with no moon. Kainz was able to successfully shoot low-light shots with detail not possible before, including capturing the Milky Way. Those shots, with as many as 64 single photos including some black exposures with tape over the lens, were then taken into a desktop photo editing program and merged to eliminate the grain of high ISO. In scenarios where the ground or sky wasn’t sharp, he combined the images using layer masks to determine which parts of which photo showed in the final image. The result? While the resolution still isn’t the same as a DSLR, Kainz was able to successfully shoot low-light shots with detail not possible before, including capturing the Milky Way. While the process still requires a tripod, Kainz says an app that could handle the merging of those 64 photos could make low-light photography from a smartphone more accessible, even for users that have no idea how to merge 64 photos or how to use layer masks. “Trying to find out if phone cameras might be suitable for outdoor nighttime photography was a fun experiment, and clearly the result is yes, they are,” he wrote. “However, arriving at the final images required a lot of careful post-processing on a desktop computer, and the procedure is too cumbersome for all but the most dedicated cellphone photographers. However, with the right software a phone should be able to process the images internally, and if steps such as painting layer masks by hand can be eliminated, it might be possible to do point-and-shoot photography in very low-light conditions.” Kainz doesn’t say whether Google is working on an app that could do all the heavy processing without a desktop computer, but he says the software might just be possible. To see the rest of the shots from the experiment, check out Kainz’ Google Photos album.

How to customize Chrome's terrible New Tab page Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:02am PDTApr 27, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications News Article Contents 1 Removing suggested content 2 Removing recent downloads and offline pages 3 Removing recently-visited bookmarks 4 Show tabs from other devices 5 Turning on the condensed layout 6 Switching to the Chrome Home interface Back in Chrome 54, Google replaced Chrome for Android's New Tab page with a new design that prominently featured suggested content - much like Google Now's feed. To quote Douglas Adams, "This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. If you're not a fan of Chrome's cluttered New Tab page, there are a few workarounds you can try to make it a bit more usable. You can even mix and match features to create a more personalized design. The below workarounds require enabling or disabling Chrome flags. To do this, navigate to "chrome://flags" (without the quotes), press the menu icon, select 'Find in page,' and type the name of the flag starting with the hashtag symbol. Removing suggested content Removing the suggested articles list is pretty simple. Find the #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Once you do that and re-open Chrome, the list will no longer appear on the New Tab page. Removing recent downloads and offline pages The New Tab page also shows recent file downloads by default, but this is fairly easy to remove as well. Find the #enable-ntp-asset-download-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Then make sure you re-launch Chrome, and it should be gone. In addition, pages you have saved for offline reading show up on the New Tab page. If you want, you can turn this off by disabling #enable-ntp-offline-page-download-suggestions. Removing recently-visited bookmarks By default, Chrome shows bookmarks you have recently visited on the New Tab page. This can also be turned off by disabling the #enable-ntp-bookmark-suggestions flag. Show tabs from other devices As you may know, Chrome syncs your open tabs across your devices, so you can easily pick up from where you left off. There is a hidden flag that adds a 'Tabs from other devices' section to the New Tab Page. The only catch is that suggested articles has to also be turned on, which is a bit of a bummer. To turn it on, make sure both #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions and #enable-ntp-foreign-sessions-suggestions are set to Enabled. Then, reopen Chrome, and your tabs from other devices should appear. Turning on the condensed layout If you do like the suggested content or other features on the page, you still might want to turn on the condensed New Tab page layout. This removes the large space at the top, where the Google logo normally sits, allowing for more content to be visible without scrolling.   Left: Condensed design disabled, Right: Condensed design enabled To turn on the condensed layout, simply enable the #ntp-condensed-layout flag and re-launch Chrome. This is already enabled by default in Chrome Dev, at least on my device, so it may come to Chrome stable in the near future. Switching to the Chrome Home interface Chrome is constantly changing, and there's already another revamp of the New Tab page interface in development. It's called Chrome Home, and it moves the address bar to the bottom of the screen. With this new layout, the New Tab page is accessible by swiping up from the address bar, and it includes navigation icons for Downloads, Bookmarks, and History.    This new design only works on Chrome Dev and Canary for now. To try it out, switch #enable-chrome-home and #ntp-google-g-in-omnibox to Enabled and re-open Chrome. There you have it - a few tips to make Chrome's New Tab page less awful. Let us know in the comments if you have any suggestions we didn't mention. Tags chrome chrome 58 chrome home chrome new tab page chrome ntp new tab page ntp subscribe ...

George at this rate, They need an 'Of The Hour' section... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Switching what the Bixby button does was possible with an app, but the recent update removes this ability. Nerds go apoplectic with rage against Samsung. Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. No outrage yet. Corbin Davenport Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ An EXTRA button, i.e., a button other phones don't even have. Does Samsung have a good reason for locking it into Bixby? It's too early to tell. Shaun39 You should put a sarcasm tag at the end of your clueless comments. EcE An EXTRA button many people reportedly have been pressing accidentally more often than trying to use it. MadMartigan Bingo. They could at least have put it on the other side. As it is, 100% of the time I hit I am trying to turn the volume down. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You'll never admit it, but I guarantee you'd be complaining no matter where they put the button. MadMartigan I think you may be having some trouble reading for comprehension. I'll gladly admit it, as it has been my point all along. Not a fan of Bixby. Not a fan of the button placement. Wouldn't mind at least being able to remap it to make it at least marginally useful rather than just simply in the way. They put the button in a very bad place. Adding insult to injury - they have now disallowed making it at all useful to anyone not inexplicably fond of Bixby. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does. Also, if they put it on the right, I guarantee people would still complain about accidentally pressing it. In other words, you guys will complain about anything as long as it's Samsung. EcE The point you are missing, is the comment you are replying to: "Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change." Having that button which you could be able to disable if Samsung weren't dicks, is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people don't even have yet. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! The nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. EcE Because when someone found a way to change it's behavior, Samsung quickly blocked it. An extra hardware button is more annoying than a home page you can just ignore, period. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And you can use another browser. Nobody's forcing you to use Chrome. You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it. Or just buy a phone without an extra button. That'll show Samsung. Same difference. MadMartigan "You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it." Proof positive you just straight up refuse to understand that the placement is a problem for some people. "Just not pressing it" is not as simple as you seem to want to make it sound. I've accidentally launched it several times trying to lower the volume on the 8+ and I can only imagine it would be even worse on the S8. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Proof positive you're just a whiny baby. I've accidentally pressed the volume button many times when trying to press the power button, because my hand grabs both sides of the phone to get the leverage to press the power button. As much as it may amaze you to hear this, I survive this heart-rending inconvenience. MadMartigan God forbid anyone express an opinion that doesn't cast Samsung in the best possible light... /s MadMartigan ..and you nerd rage against anyone who thinks it might not be the best thing ever, can we talk about that, maybe? You know, since we're apparently not allowed to discuss the possibility that they might have handled it better? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You implied that the lack of complaints was because Chrome 58 is still rolling out. I pointed out that the nerd rage about the button occurred before people got their phones, thus nullifying your point. Discuss anything you want. MadMartigan Except any possibility that Samsung could have done something better. Apparently we're not allowed to do that without being called names... MadMartigan "If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does." So a bad key placement could not be made at least marginally better by allowing to map to something you might actually someday use... Got it. Your logic is flawless... /s Necdet Ali Özdür How come people don't press other buttons accidentally but​ somehow keep pressing Bixby button all the time? EcE Who said that? Necdet Ali Özdür ... you? EcE Oh yeah? I said: "Bixby is the only button people press accidentally" ... I'm sure I did. and btw, HTC's power button just below the volume buttons is/was (HTC 9/10 and whichever else they did the same) something to complain about as well. Either way, the point here is that having an extra button that cannot be disabled/remapped is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people have not seen yet. Necdet Ali Özdür That doesn't mean those people won't see it, I guess that's the point you are missing. Both decisions can be reversed by respective parties by means of a software update, but people (especially here in Android Police) complain about Samsung the most. EcE Nah, I think we enjoy bi+ching about everything Necdet Ali Özdür Who doesn't? 😂 MadMartigan Possibly due to it's bad placement. Have you been paying attention? Necdet Ali Özdür It's placed where a button could be placed on an all screen phone. Like the rest of them it's on the side. MadMartigan So there's no other place they could have put it? Really? I hope you're actually trying to be dense... Do phones you use not have tops, bottoms, or right sides? Do they have no room at all below where the button is currently placed on the left? Necdet Ali Özdür I hope that next phone you own will have a power button on the bottom and volume buttons on the top. Because those are valid positions to place buttons. Yeah. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It doesn't matter where the buttons are. If it's a Samsung phone, at least 75% of AP commenters will be outraged. MadMartigan ...and the one fanboy will attempt to shout down anyone with a valid opinion regarding how it could have been better. Because to him, Sammy can do no wrong. FWIW: I have not owned a Samsung since the S2 and as this was the first one without the ridiculous home button, I jumped at it. I like pretty much *everything* about the device other than the absurd Bixby-button. MadMartigan lmao. Are you being serious? HTC had power buttons on the top - never once accidentally powered it off. You really cannot accept that the placement may not be optimal for some people? That this is the only place they could have put it? Necdet Ali Özdür It's in a place where majority of current devices have their buttons. Sounds more optimal to me than the places you've suggested. Some people may not like to have it at that place, or not have that extra button at all. But in my opinion it is the best place to place Samsung could've put it. MadMartigan So the right side, where there is currently only one button, would be a worse place for it? They couldn't texture the power button and have the bixby button 1/2 inch below it? That wouldn't be better than the same texture as the volume keys, and right next to them? I mean heck, even if they'd just added a texture to it...that would have been better. Necdet Ali Özdür It is significantly smaller than the volume button (which is a rocker now) which makes it easy to differentiate with a finger. But yeah a texture wouldn't hurt. I agree you on this one. But if it was on the right side, I'm pretty sure people would still complain as much as they do now, claiming they're confusing it with the power button and such. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're complaining because it's a Samsung phone. If this was a button on the Pixel, it could be in the worst possible location and they'd go to the ends of the earth to defend it. MadMartigan Honestly, I would have loved it on the right, in a perfect location to be hit by the finger right above the pinky when needed. Power-index, Bixby two fingers down. Would have, IMO, been perfect. Could have even gone without the texture on that one. Where it is now, you're going after it with your thumb. Until muscle-memory kicks in, it's a crap-shoot where it's going to land initially and unless you expect to have to double-check, you're going in to press - and could easily press the wrong one. It's all personal preference, to be sure, but I do believe they could have appeased far more people by putting it on the right. FWIW - the same complain was leveled at HTC when they placed the power/volume buttons on the same side, though I do not believe the volume was a rocker on that model. Could have been done better. My favorite device was actually the One M7 - which had the power-button on the top. Power-top, volume-right, nothing on the left. Zero possibility of confusion. (Power on the back would have been fine as well - V20 nailed the fingerprint sensor/power on that one.) bekifft There is no good reason for locking hardware functionality away from the user. Don't give them a pass on taking more control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ As I say below, the nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. This isn't about timing. It's about Google love vs. Samsung hate. MadMartigan Wow. Someone's triggered... Tiuri Elvander I was and am still outraged. Have been since this came up in the review of 58 Beta Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, so far, that makes one of you, vs. the dozens of people who went into a nerd rage about the Bixby button, many of whom don't even have or want the phone. MJ I don't use Chrome a lot to care enough to disable the new tab page crap but why would Google stop users from customizing it? I can do that with Firefox... Address bar at the bottom of the screen? WTF? Michel Sa Address bar at the bottom makes a lot more sense on a mobile phone. Renan In a mobile phone, having the address bar at the bottom of the screen makes a lot of sense MJ No... ipsofact yes... MJ How have I been able to use the address bar on my phone at the top all this time? EcE Magic? ipsofact we never said you could not use the address bar on your phone. But on mobile its a lot quicker and pain free to have it at the bottom. Unless you want to stretch your thumb all the time. MJ Come on... Are you a human? When I hold my phone my thumb is already naturally pointing toward the top of my phone so would need to stretch it to make it to the bottom. Regardless, I happen to have nine other fingers and the on-screen keyboard pops up in the same place anyway. I have been using the address bar at the top of browsers for over 20 years now so don't need to be changing my workflow habits now and just on my phone on top of it. ipsofact typical ive been doing this for 20 years so I wont change the way I work. You know I work with several people with the same mentality.. I have been using the address bar at the top since day 1 but today I changed it to the bottom. Works great and believe me I won't let the old "ive been doing it like this for years" ever stop me. Or just put the phone upside down. it works ;) MJ Change is not the issue... It's change for no good reason or benefit. At least give the user control to change it back. Some unknown God(s) at Google one day just deciding the address bar will now go at the bottom is ridiculous. Microsoft tried that crap on a larger scale with Windows 8. How did that work out for them? ipsofact You can change it back and forth. Its up to the user to decide. So we are not being obligated to do anything. Just given options! :) Which I like. I can decide the whether the bar will go up the top or the bottom. MJ What? LOL The whole article is about Google not allowing users to disable the crap on new tabs. Thanks for your input and have a good day. MadMartigan "It's change for no good reason or benefit." Thankfully, your refusal to see the reason or benefit does not affect the ability of anyone else to. MadMartigan He said it made sense on the bottom - not that it wasn't unusable on the top. Reading is fundamental. FeelThePoveR It depends on the usage. Sometimes I press my hardware buttons accidentally when doing the swipe up gesture on the bottom adress bar in chrome (closing the tab/app or whatever). I'm still loving it though. MadMartigan People still use mobile Firefox?? ipsofact Firefox still use mobile people? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Except for Android and the Play Store (and their dependencies), I'm off all Google apps. I'm sick of the constant BS coming out of Google. I use Dolphin as my browser. If I get frustrated with Android enough, I'll just give up my precious S Pen and give an iPhone a chance. MadMartigan I loved that change and wish they'd bring it to desktop Chrome. Would love a "Google Now" start-page on the desktop. Kieron Quinn I've used iChrome as a Google Now-esque NTP for a while, it used to be a lot better (especially when it actually got Google Now cards via a hidden API) but is slowly getting worse: http://i.imgur.com/vfO7Kfq.png TomsDisqusted The suggested content is all the worst possible sources of news on the internet - I guess those are the ones that have the most advertising revenue per view - so I'm glad to see there is a way to get rid of it. It would be better though if Google would simply show me news from the sources that I actually use! Tiuri Elvander I disabled the suggestions and they were indeed gone. Instead I got some annoying round image with some text saying "that's all for now. More articles will appear soon." Uninstalled 58 and installed 57 again. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions isn't available in mine, so I can't turn on Recent Tabs like I'd like to... cgrant There are apps that will do this without all the fuss. Try TabMark. deepdvd That's a Chrome extension, not a mobile app. Try again? pfmiller I think the easiest solution is just to stick with Chrome 57 until Google fixes this mess. Peter I want my bookmarks back on the New Tab Page, or at least a link to them. Having to open the menu to get to the bookmarks is a pain when trying to open lots. bekifft Thank you for this article. This is just further encouraging my use of Brave. Not a big fan of the name, though.

Gone are the days of only two clunky options to wear around your wrist. With more options available than ever, here are nine smartwatches and fitness trackers worth your time. Note: We eschewed the popular Jawbone UP from this list because of reports that Jawbone is discontinuing the UP line and its oft-criticized customer service. We also omitted Kickstarter-funded Pebble watches, despite their popularity on Amazon, because its products were officially discontinued in late 2016, meaning they will no longer be eligible for customer service. View gallery (9) The 9 best fitness trackers and smartwatches of 2017 1 of 9 Courtesy image 1. Apple Watch Series 2 It's been around for a while now, but the Apple Watch is still the king of the smartwatch space. Apple's wearable has the works: a heart-rate sensor, built-in GPS, water resistance, and syncing with Apple's Health and Workout apps. Apple also allows you to customize your watch with a wide variety of straps, from super-classy Hermes straps to the Nike+ Sport Band. (From $269, apple.com) Courtesy image 2. LG Watch Sport Eager to take the fitness smartwatch crown, Google has recently revealed its new Android Wear 2.0 software, with the LG Watch Sport as its starting quarterback. The Sport not only supports Google Assistant for voice commands, but also allows users to make calls and use apps like Strava and Runtastic without a tethered phone, thanks to its built-in LTE band. ($349, lg.com) Courtesy image 3. Fitbit Alta HR Fitbit's latest offering is an upgraded version of one of their most popular fitness trackers. The Alta HR combines the best of both worlds by mixing the sleek and compact design of the original Alta while adding a heart-rate tracker and automatic sleep tracking features that were originally only available on its siblings, the Charge 2 and the Flex. The Alta HR also supports Fitbit's brand new "sleep stages" feature, where you can observe exactly how long you were in each stage of sleep (light sleep, deep sleep, and REM) each night. ($149.99, fitbit.com) Courtesy image 4. Polar M430 Polar's new flagship smartwatch prides itself on accurate GPS and heart-rate tracking above all else. Billed as the perfect smartwatch for serious runners, the M430 has six LED heart sensors and incorporates Polar's Smart Coaching feature that provides custom training tips based on your goals. ($229, polar.com) Courtesy image 5. Garmin Forerunner 935 It might not be cheap, but Garmin's Forerunner 935 was designed to be the marathon runner's best friend. The 935's biggest feature is its integration with the popular Fitness app Strava, allowing for "Live Segments," in which it provides in-depth data on your current performance while running your favorite routes. You can also sync the 935 with the app TrainingPeaks for real-time intensity targets and interval durations. ($499, garmin.com) Courtesy image 6. Withings Steel HR There's no denying that a lot of fitness trackers and smartwatches put functionality before looks, but with the Withings Steel HR, beauty, brains, and brawn go hand in hand. The Steel HR is a traditional analog watch that includes an activity dial and a small digital screen that tracks heart rate. This minimalist approach has its benefits, as the Steel HR's battery lasts up to 25 days (as opposed to many other smartwatches, which only survive for a day or two without a recharge). It's also water resistant up to 50 meters and syncs automatically with Withings' iOS/Android apps. ($199.99, withings.com) Courtesy image 7. Huawei Watch 2 Chinese tech giant Huawei has made its foray into the fitness space with the brand new Watch 2, an Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch with a built-in GPS chip. The goal with the Huawei Watch 2 is to provide a comprehensive fitness tracker in a sleek package—the watch can track stats such as distance, speed, steps, heart rate, heart-rate range, calories, stride frequency, route, and more to analyze your performance and provide tips on how to improve. ($299, huawei.com) Courtesy image 8. Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Samsung is a veteran to the smartwatch scene, releasing the original Samsung Gear two years before the Apple Watch. Since then, they've continued to iterate on their original (and somewhat clunky) design, resulting in the classy and feature-filled Gear S3 Frontier. Like other smartwatches in its price range, the Frontier includes a heart-rate tracker and built-in GPS. Beyond that, though, it also has a built-in speaker and microphone for hands-free calls, as well as support for Samsung Pay, so you can use your credit card without having to take out your wallet. ($299, samsung.com) Courtesy image 9. Moov HR Sweat Want the benefits of a fitness tracker without having to wear something on your wrist? Check out Moov, which is expanding the wearables market by releasing a fitness-tracking headband. The HR Sweat provides real-time voice coaching based on your heart rate, ensuring that you maintain the proper pace and hit your goals. Of course, it's a perfectly functional sweatband as well.

It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service - one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. FILE - This Oct. 21, 2015, file photo shows signage inside the YouTube Space LA offices in Los Angeles. YouTube's inability to keep ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child. The key question is whether a recently launched ad boycott of YouTube turns out to be short-lived or the start of a long-term marketing shift away that undercuts Google's growth, as well as Alphabet Inc., its corporate parent. (AP Photo/Danny Moloshok, File) The company's earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. CLOUD OVER YOUTUBE But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. "There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person," says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. "They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices." Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had "thousands and thousands" of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. "We are evolving overall to a better place," Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing "extraordinary" growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings. That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose - Google's dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. TAKING THE GLOSS OFF Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. "This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand," says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. FLIGHT OF THE BRANDS At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. TEMPORARY HIT OR PERMANENT SCAR? Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. "It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away," he said. "There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term." Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

The company saw mobile search and ongoing strength in YouTube driving ad sales higher, while sales on Google Play, hardware and cloud grew substantially, said chief financial officer Ruth Porat. Shares rose more than 4 percent after hours, as executives said more consumers are turning to smartphones for content — and for ads. Adjusted earnings post a healthy beat (for Class A shares) EPS: $7.73 vs. $7.39 a share expected, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $24.75 billion vs. $24.22 billion expected, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate That's up compared to a year ago, when the Google parent reported adjusted first-quarter earnings of $6.02 per share on $20.26 billion in revenue (That means revenue increased 22 percent over the past year.) Extremist content weighs on advertisers, even as stock climbs during 2017 Alphabet, the public holding company of Google, makes most of its money from advertising in its core search function and on YouTube. Advertising revenues rose to $21.4 billion during the quarter, up from a little over $18 billion a year ago. Net income was $5.43 billion, up from $4.21 billion a year ago. Those ads made headlines over the last two months after The Times of London's investigation found Google's YouTube video site ran ads for major brands next to neo-Nazi and jihadist videos. In response, major brands around the world like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson announced they would suspend some digital advertising as Google made changes to its system. Still, revenues grew from last year in every geography: the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, and the other Americas. Alphabet shares are up more than 23.5 percent over the past year, and nearly 12.5 percent so far this year. Traffic acquisition costs in the Google network were $4.63 billion, slightly higher than the $4.41 billion expected by StreetAccount. Mobile is more expensive to support, Porat said. But revenue on Google properties, other revenue, and sales on the Google network all came in slightly above estimates. Alphabet's so-called Other Bets category — which includes internet company Google Fiber, smart-home brand Nest, self-driving car company Waymo and divisions for life sciences and venture capital investing — has been under pressure as the company streamlines its spending. show chapters Alphabet earnings $7.73 vs $7.39 expectations    11 Hours Ago | 00:37 Other Bets made big gains on its revenue over the past year, hitting $244 million over the past quarter, up from $165 million a year ago. Porat has trimmed programs over the past few years: The company's modular phone, Project Ara, was scrapped, and smart-home unit Nest underwent reorganization last year. More recently, Waymo has been engaged in a high-profile fight with Uber over intellectual property. Still, in a shareholder letter on Thursday, Google co-founder Larry Page highlighted the strength of these moonshot programs. While some engineers have been moved away from Google Fiber, Google is still investing heavily in data centers, and hiring cloud engineers and product managers, Porat said. "We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet," Porat said in a statement.

This isn’t necessarily the last month that Google will send out a security patch for the Pixel and Pixel XL, but up until then Google is guaranteeing a new security patch every single month, and after that point devices could be left out, and it’s likely that they would be as Google rarely ends up pushing any sort of update out to devices beyond the dates they have set for a cutoff. As has always been the case, Pixel and Nexus devices are guaranteed security updates for a three-year period from when the device first made available for purchase from Google, though Google has amended this to be 18 months after the last time devices were sold even if the 18 months is further out than the three-year period. In addition to listing off when security patches are expected to be cut off, Google has also listed when Pixel devices can expect to be locked out from software version updates, which is after October of 2018. This would mark the two-year period of Google’s software update guarantee from when the device was first made available and similar to the security patch guarantee this is nothing new. This means users with a Pixel or Pixel XL can certainly expect Android O as a version update, and whatever the next version after it is that will be coming in 2018. After that, chances are they wont’ get any additional new software officially through Google. Nexus devices are listed on the same page as the Pixel and Pixel XL, and this includes the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, the two most recent Nexus devices and both of which were launched in 2015, as well as the Nexus 9 and Nexus 6 which are the only other two that are still guaranteed. The list also shows Nexus devices dating back to the 2012 Nexus 7, but anything before the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 is no longer supported. According to Google’s list, the Nexus 9 and Nexus 6 are not guaranteed any security patches after October of 2017, while their Android version update guarantees already expired in October of last year. As for the more recent Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, version updates are no longer guaranteed after September of this year, while security patches will not be guaranteed after September of 2018. If you own a device which is still supported by either software updates, security patches, or both, you can see the full list in the images down below.

City officials predicted nearly 4,000 future households in the area wouldn't need to own a car -- a drastic change made possible thanks in part to the advent of self-driving cars and far-off plans for a citywide automated-rail service. City officials were reassured by their own consultant team, as well as representatives from Google, the major employer and property owner in the area, that they could max out housing without worrying too much about the traffic it would bring. A new analysis by the transportation firm Fehr & Peers showed the right formula of dense apartments, meager parking and new access routes could actually reduce traffic congestion. It was an auspicious sign for City Council members who were swept into office on a shared goal to transform North Bayshore into a mixed-use neighborhood. That vision depends on creating a "live-work" neighborhood where residents could walk to their jobs. Under the standard playbook for city planning, it was reasonable to highlight parking as mandatory for new development, said Councilwoman Pat Showalter at the April 25 meeting. But the city is nearly at a paradigm shift, she said. "Many of the assumptions that we use in our modeling, we simply don't know how they're going to play out," she said. "We're all concerned about the parking ratio, but we're on the cusp of having our parking needs change with all the technology going forward." Taking a cue from Google representatives, she and other colleagues advocated for a phased approach that would provide more parking early on, but would gradually aim for a rock-bottom quota of 0.6 parking spaces per apartment. Jeral Poskey, a Google transportation planner, urged city officials to leave as much flexibility as possible in their plans. That would allow developers to bring forward new ideas, he said. "We know that traffic is one of the top concerns here, but adding housing reduces regional traffic -- that was clear from this analysis," said Poskey. "Nobody wants traffic in this area to get worse, certainly not us." But the aggressive parking plan won only a thin coalition of supporters on the council. Three council members warned it would be a recipe for trouble down the road. Councilman John McAlister criticized his colleagues for not thinking enough about the current needs for households to have their own cars. A better way for developers to go, he suggested, would be to engineer parking garages that could easily be transformed into additional housing if parking truly became unnecessary in the future. "(They're saying) let's build as much as we can, and then later solve the transportation problems," he said. "I want to make sure what we build is a good neighborhood; I don't want us to just to build as much as we can." At its meeting, the Mountain View City Council took a fresh look at the city's office park north of Highway 101, where the city is pursuing plans to add nearly 10,000 new apartments. The Tuesday meeting focused on North Bayshore's transportation needs, which have been the major roadblock for new development in the area. Currently, the North Bayshore has three main access roads -- Shoreline, Rengstorff and San Antonio -- but those arteries result in daily traffic jams from thousands for workers trying to funnel into the area. Mass transit is nonexistent, except for public buses and corporate shuttles. The new strategy called for reviving some long dormant plans for North Bayshore, such as adding a bridge over Stevens Creek to provide a new access from Moffett Field. Google proposed building the bridge in 2013, but a slim council majority opposed the idea, mainly for environmental reasons. In a change, most of the council members on Tuesday signaled they would support a bridge crossing at Charleston Road to connect to the vicinity of a Moffett Field U.S. Army Reserve property off R.T. Jones Road. City officials reported the new bridge would be reserved mainly for transit shuttles, light-rail and "other technologies," and most solo drivers wouldn't be allowed to use it. For Google, the bridge is a crucial connection for more than just North Bayshore. At the western side of the NASA Ames Research Center, the company has recently started grading for a new office campus totaling about 1 million square feet. NASA Ames and Google officials did not answer repeated requests by the Voice for more information about the project. But the company reportedly confirmed the project was going forward at a Moffett Field stakeholder meeting earlier this month, according to a meeting participant. At the Tuesday meeting, council members signaled they were less enthusiastic about another old proposal to build a new underpass below Highway 101 to connect Charleston Road to Landings Drive. The proposed road would be used for commuters, cyclists and pedestrians. But the idea found lukewarm support with many council members, with some warning it would enable more congestion. They still asked staff to study the idea. The council also gave a cold reception to another hot-button idea to study "congestion pricing" for North Bayshore -- essentially charging motorists a fee to enter the area during the busiest times. Realizing they were courting controversy, city staff members emphasized they were only considering the idea as a last resort to reduce traffic, but elected leaders said the idea could backfire by encouraging more traffic. "It would be a discriminatory system against low-income people," said Councilman Lenny Siegel. "The only solution is to build a robust transit system." Mountain View is currently working on an initial study to develop an automated-guideway transit system that would go from the downtown transit center to North Bayshore. Additionally, VTA officials are nearly finished with a Google-funded study on building a new transit line from the NASA Ames light-rail station into North Bayshore. The transportation talk was the latest step in the city's complicated process to draft a precise plan for residential growth in North Bayshore. City planning staff say they will refine the report so it can be brought back to the council for final adoption in June.

Considering the councils track record on traffic infrastructure I don't trust that they will do anything meaningful to deal with the inevitable increase in traffic. You can't force everybody onto bicycles. Oh wait...they did get us two shuttle buses that nobody uses. They have talked about these automated transit systems for years and actually had offers from companies to demonstrate there system and the council refused. I worked in north shoreline during the Silicon Graphics days and it was a mess even then. There have been no real changes to shoreline since then. And let's not even talk about 101!

Clearly the plan is to build GoogleTown there at no expense to Google -- the assumption being that everyone who lives there will be a Google employee and hence will just ride a GoogleBike to work. I sure hope Google never fails, or we're gonna have one giant mess on our hands. #CompanyTown Report Objectionable Content Email Town Square Moderator       1 person likes this Posted by Ed a resident of Old Mountain View 8 hours ago If we assume that the number of cars per housing unit is some kind of immutable law of California physics, and mandate plentiful cheap parking, then of course we will end up with a neighborhood full of people who need cars to get around. But people do not choose where to live completely independently of their transportation needs. If overnight parking is expensive and scarce in North Bayshore, the neighborhood will attract mostly those who don't need cars. An immutable law of nature broken by the stroke of a pen!

Any studies or facts to back that up?

If people can't park N of Bayshore, then they'll park S of Bayshore in residential neighborhoods and particularly downtown where shuttles will pick them up. It'd be far better to confine the traffic/parking contagion to N Bayshore where it belongs.

I applaud the city for leading the vision towards a non-car based living community. This is a tragedy of riches, people want to create jobs here, that's a good thing! Let private entities create housing that has a smaller carbon footprint. The city is however underestimating the number of potential families, there would likely need to be a new school and other public services in the future, so we need to make sure that development fees and future taxes will cover these added infrastructure needs. Growth is good, just make sure the infrastructure keeps up. Maybe it's time for an employee tax like what Cupertino considered. An employee tax that would be waived if the employee lived in MV.

"Nobody wants traffic in this area to get worse, certainly not us." This project would ease REGIONAL TRAFFIC. Google says they don't want "traffic in this area to get worse", but that has nothing to do with reality, which is local traffic WILL be worse. "Wanting" doesn't solve anything, because their greater want is to have more staff working in their MV offices. That is the WANT that will drive the building of an ultra-dense, urban hell currently called E Bayshore. If that area is built up, I guarantee that they residents there will either take over the City Council OR petition to break away and form a E. Mountain View.

Eventually, it will be affordable in Mountain View, because MV will be such a bad place to live, that Alphabet will move jobs away, seeking segregation from the innovation and productivity impacting congestion stress of over crowding. They will leave behind the demanding impoverished diversity, who struggle to live with the compounded stress of traveling across 101 to get the parking they require for their livelihoods.

Even if people do what these pie-in-the-sky dreamers want and live within walking distance of their jobs, did it cross the minds of any of them that people don't JUST work? Maybe they want to take a vacation and drive down the coast. Maybe they have elderly relatives in Hollister that they visit weekly and they don't care to spend 2-3 hours each direction taking public transit to see them. Maybe they are disabled and can't bike to the grocery store. Maybe they are elderly and don't do things the way the City Council thinks they should. Maybe, just maybe, they want to decide for themselves how to run their lives without input from people who don't live in their house or understand their needs. This City Council has, and only one, desire. They want to raise revenue so they can run their social experiments on the residents of this city. They have no concern for the consequences of their actions nor do they care if it is best for the people who live here. Maybe the City Council should be subject to conducting their lives according to the will of a group of citizens chosen by a drawing of lots. Perhaps they would take the will of the people who ALREADY live here a bit more seriously.

There should be a shared goal that neither side should try to impose their values on the other. All residents and businesses in MV should aim to be cost neutral on their neighbors through fees and taxations directed, as much as possible, at those who create those burdens. Rather than say "no" to anything new, lets just make sure anything new is responsible for their impact on others. Lets pose questions, and demand answers, rather than throw insults.

Did they not live here when the bubble burst in 2000, and the downturn of 2008? It may seem like Google can't fail, but any company can. And then we will have an MV with empty office space and apartments. Also, 10,000 apartments?

Worse, the businesses do not provide street parking, cannibalizing existing neighborhood parking. Who came up with this brilliant idea? It doesn't work. Also, I can tell you that Google employees don't live next door to their work. Nobody does. If they actually do live close for a time, they get transferred and that's the end of that. Once transferred, they have to move or take on a horrendous commute. Not to mention the many contract employees that come for a year or a summer, and then leave because they can't possibly afford to live here while unemployed, even for a short time. So then, we just have a very transient area. Mountain View is so expensive that because of the central location, many couples find it an ideal place to live simply because of the easy freeway access. More people here that don't work here. Then, many people working here in city and restaurant jobs who can't afford to live here and commute from other areas. So, no, minimal parking doesn't work, it never will work, in fact it makes things worse. Companies in residential neighborhoods suck. Companies should be required to provide street parking just like homes do. Nobody wants to live at their job. It sucks.

Housing built adjacent to tech growth is no pipe dream, just look at Menlo Park and Facebook. We need to be more imaginative.

The search engine's latest move is to demote (but not remove) pages that propagate lies, hoaxes, conspiracy theories and other junk content that more and more is collectively being labeled "fake news." Google had not previously made this fix because, according to executives, although the results were important, the amount of traffic relevant to the issue was so small—a quarter of a percent, reports Bloomberg. But when these queries did produce a fake news story as the top result, it made Google seem embarrassingly fallible, especially when it returned phony answers in a "feature snippet," the authoritative-looking box that seems to state the simple truth (see example below). This news comes at the same time as survey results from Zignal Labs /Harris Poll that reveals that 86% of Americans don't fact-check articles they see on social media, and more than a quarter of Americans share articles that they don't fact-check, because they tend to trust their friends who posted it. This gives us insight into how fake news can be amplified via friend networks faster now than ever before. “For brands and public figures with the potential to find themselves in the media spotlight, this means swiftly identifying and maximizing opportunities—or mitigating reputational risk—is more critical now than ever before," said Josh Ginsberg, Zignal CEO. PR News is jumping into the fray May 31 with a new webinar, "How to Navigate #FakeNews as a Communications Professional," featuring expert advice from Reebok, IBM, LexisNexis and more. Join us as we discuss how to debunk fake news to your stakeholders, how to engage on social media and how to get leadership on board with your efforts to set the record straight in an era of information confusion.

The Amazon Echo family may get even bigger. Amazon will likely reveal a new Echo device with a built-in screen next month, a person familiar with the plans told CNET. This information comes just after Amazon on Wednesday introduced the Echo Look, a smart speaker with a built-in camera. The person said Amazon had been working to more fully develop its Echo devices, but it appeared to get a "wake-up call" last week after Google said its Home smart speakers can now identify multiple users, a feature Echo devices don't have. Amazon's devices team may now be looking to speed up introduction of these products so they can stay ahead of Google, the person added. Timing on the new Echo device's introduction may change, the person said. An Amazon representative declined to comment for this story. The rush to get out a new version of its hit speaker underscores the fierce battle raging to dominate your home and connected devices. While Amazon enjoyed a significant lead in getting its Echo into homes and has aggressively built up the capabilities of its Alexa voice assistant, Google is coming on strong with its own Home speaker. Whichever companies are able to dominate will be able to embed their products deeply into people's lives for years to come. The new device may help Amazon expand and improve the Echo's capabilities in more areas, including video chats and online shopping, making the gadget more of a must-have item for homes. Amazon sold an estimated 8 million Echo devices in the US since the product first launched, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners said in January. Apple is also reportedly working on its own Echo and Home competitor with a built-in camera.  Reports of an Echo with a screen have come out since last year, with the Wall Street Journal writing about such a device last May and Bloomberg publishing its own story in November. The device's internal code name is "Knight," the person said, a name the Journal reported in May. The person couldn't confirm whether the screen was a touchscreen. It's a smart move by Amazon. While voice assistants can tackle simple commands, the screen could allow Alexa to respond to more complex queries, said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research who didn't have direct knowledge of the company's plans. For example, voice shopping on the Echo today often requires users to wait and listen to multiple choices, but a screen could present those options all at once. Also, there's a better chance Amazon will come out with an Echo that includes both a screen and camera, especially now that the Echo Look has been introduced, Dawson suggested. Having a screen available could cut down on Alexa misunderstanding a query, a problem that's still typical for voice assistants, said Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights & Strategy, who also wasn't aware of the Amazon's plans. "Audio input and output isn't always the best because it rarely gets it right every time," he added. Alexa is available on Amazon's Fire tablets and Fire TV, with the tablet's screen able to show additional information, such as the weather report, when Alexa is queried. Alexa can also be used to get news and launch apps on the tablet and Fire TV. CNET en Español: Get all your tech news and reviews in Spanish. Does the Mac still matter?

Image: People stand under a sign at Google headquarters Google is about to change the internet browsing experience in Cuba in a big way. On Wednesday, the technology giant became the first foreign internet company to set up servers in the island nation. While it won't do much to boost internet access in the country, it will speed up the experience for those who are already online. Google's Cuban servers will be able to store popular content locally, making it easier for people within Cuba to watch something, such as a viral YouTube video, according to Buzzfeed, which first reported the news. Previously, people surfing the internet in Cuba have had to rely on a long-distance cable connecting Cuba via Venezuela. With U.S.-Cuban diplomatic ties now open for the first time in decades, Cuba signed a deal with Google last December aimed at improving its internet speeds. "This in turn means Cubans who already have access to the internet and want to use our services can expect to see an improvement in terms of quality of service and reduced latency for cached content," said Google last year. Related: Why U.S. Airlines Are Dropping Flights to Cuba The island country is currently lagging behind much of the world when it comes to connectivity, with internet access being a costly luxury only few can afford.

Anthony Levandowski, head of Uber's self-driving program, discusses its driverless cars in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Attorneys for Uber worked Thursday morning to convince a federal judge that a case brought by rival Waymo over the alleged theft of trade secrets from the company should be dealt with in arbitration and not in a public trial, the latest twist in the high-stakes legal battle over the future of autonomous cars.  Uber argued inside a federal courtroom in San Francisco today that Waymo’s claims relate to Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski, who it says committed the theft while still a Google employee (Google parent Alphabet Inc. owns Waymo), making the issue a violation of his contract and therefore a matter to be resolved through private arbitration. Waymo, created last year to commercialize Google’s robotic car software and hardware, insisted that’s not the basis of its suit. “We are are suing a third-party competitor… about independent things they have done,” said attorney Charles Verhoeven, arguing on behalf of Waymo. “Sure, he might be part of it, but … we are not relying on the employee agreement.” At stake is Uber’s ability to push forward with its own autonomous vehicle program, an area in which Google faces fierce competition despite having more than a seven-year head start. On May 3 the judge in the case is also scheduled to decide whether to grant Waymo’s request for a temporary injunction that would effectively halt Uber’s R&D efforts and specifically bar Levandowski’s involvement in the program. A possible trial in the case looms this summer — if the matter isn’t sent to arbitration first. Attorneys for both sides have not been timid in describing the ramifications of the lawsuit. “This is not your garden variety trade secrets case,” lawyers for Uber said in court papers earlier this week arguing for the deposition of Google cofounder Larry Page over alleged conversations he had with Levandowski (the court denied Uber’s request). “This is a case that involves potentially what may be the most lucrative business in history.” The battle began in February when Waymo learned that Uber appeared to be developing a laser LiDAR sensor circuit identical to one of Google’s own design. Waymo’s lawsuit detailed how Levandowski had downloaded more than 14,000 documents, including thousands related to LiDAR, from an internal Google server and transferred the data to a personal drive about six weeks before he resigned from its self-driving car project in late 2015. © The rear window of a Waymo driverless car during at a Google event in San Francisco. The rear window of a Waymo driverless car during a Google event on Dec. 13, 2016, in San Francisco. In January 2016, Levandowski started his own company, Otto, with a goal of creating self-driving commercial trucks. In August 2016, Uber bought Otto for about $680 million, and put Levandowski in charge of its driverless car research efforts. Waymo has also alleged that Levandowski had been in secret talks with Uber about the acquisition even before he left Google to form Otto. Despite repeated requests from Waymo and the court, Levandowski and Uber haven’t yet returned the files at issue or provided an “unredacted” privilege log related to the matter. Levandowski, who is not a defendant in the case, has sought to exercise his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to prevent turning over an unredacted log. That request was denied by a federal appeals court this week, after it was initially rejected by the district court. Both Uber and Google, like most big Silicon Valley firms, prefer to handle employee disputes through arbitration. Uber’s attorney Arturo González pointed this out, saying it was “unfair for Google to try and have it both ways.” “This case is clearly a dispute…regarding conduct with Levandowski. And yet they want to go to court against Uber,” Gonzalez said Thursday. “Uber hired Levandowski. The unfairness to Levandowski is also an unfairness to Uber.” Judge William Alsup picked up on the irony as well, telling Waymo’s Verhoeven that Google “wants to force everyone into arbitration, and sets the broadest arbitration agreements you can. And now… you’re scrambling” to show why that shouldn’t be the case with Levandowski.  Verhoeven countered, saying for at least the third time during the brief hearing that Waymo was not relying on Levandowski’s employment agreement to bring its case against Uber. LiDAR is a laser radar sensor system that generates 3-D, high-definition images in 360-degrees around a vehicle. It’s considered vital technology for safe, reliable autonomous cars. © The LiDAR mapping display in Uber’s self-driving Ford Fusion. The LiDAR mapping display in Uber's self-driving Ford Fusion. The cost of LiDAR units has plunged from tens of thousands of dollars a few years ago to a few thousand currently. Suppliers including Velodyne and Quanergy want to reduce that cost to a few hundred dollars or less within the next few three years. Levandowski was a star in the self-driving car world for years. He joined Google in 2007, after helping Stanford University’s DARPA Challenge team with its autonomous vehicles, and was a core member of the Google self-driving car project from its inception, working with original team leader Sebastian Thrun and Chris Urmson.

Google Home hasn't even celebrated its first birthday yet, but now it's learning that it must share its prized possession: the voice-activated Google Assistant. This lesson is thanks to Google's unveiling on Thursday of a software development kit (SDK) that will let third-party developers integrate the Assistant—which powers the artificial intelligence in the Home and select Android phones—into their own devices. That could open up the floodgates for connected home enthusiasts to utter the "OK, Google" phrase and have their demands met by a dizzying array of devices, from table lamps to webcams. "With this SDK, you can now start building your own hardware prototypes that include the Google Assistant, like a self-built robot or a voice-enabled smart mirror," Google told developers on Thursday. "This allows you to interact with the Google Assistant from any platform." Related 200 Things to Ask Your Google Home 200 Things to Ask Your Google Home Judging by the success of Google's chief rivals in the personal digital assistant market (Amazon Alexa and the Echo speakers), developers will jump at the opportunity. Alexa already has thousands of "skills" that let it do everything from order an Uber to dim the living room lights. Amazon has also recently given developers access to everything from Echo's voice recognition tech to Alexa's language processing AI. Google's SDK works by allowing companies to configure their devices to capture a spoken query, such as "what's on my calendar?" The query is then sent to the Google Assistant service in the cloud, which sends back an audio response for the device to play. In addition to Google Home, Google Assistant currently works with Pixel phones, Google Allo, and some Android devices running the running Marshmallow and Nougat OS versions. On the software side, it already has more than 200 third-party skills—"conversation actions" in Google parlance.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Ignoring controversy, Larry Page gives glowing Alphabet recap Chris Davies - Apr 27, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Alphabet CEO Larry Page has released the 2016 Founder’s Letter for the company, a glowing “State of the Union” for the umbrella company within which Google and Waymo reside. Published ahead of Alphabet’s latest financial results, Page’s letter predominantly focuses on the spin-offs of various projects into standalone businesses. That, after all, was the primary intention of the company when it was founded back in 2015. Then, Google was subsumed as a division of Alphabet, with Sundar Pichai its CEO. However, other businesses took their own places as near-independent divisions; that’s accelerated over the past twelve months, Page writes, “with more autonomy and dedicated leadership” the upshot. Four key projects get called out in that way. Waymo, the self-driving car division that spun out of the Google X moonshot division, is cited, as is Verily Life Sciences. That, Page says, was already involved in prescient mosquito research even before Zika began to spread. Perhaps unsurprising, Page puts a positive spin on the year and Alphabet’s operations. Some have criticized how much the company spends on its moonshots and experiments – none of which provide the sort of returns that the core advertising business delivers to Alphabet’s bottom line – and, while Page does not address that head-on, he does suggest that a more patient approach is the strategy for the months ahead. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page writes. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down. I also think we have learned a lot about how to set up new companies with a structure for success.” In short, “we’re not going to invest if we don’t see great opportunities,” the Google co-founder concludes. Companies within Alphabet that have been mired in controversy are given the soft-glove treatment: Nest, for instance, was one of a handful of “other businesses” in the organization’s portfolio to make money in its last quarter, but has been stung with criticism from former employees about the direction it is taking. Rather than comment on that, Page merely suggests that everyone should go out and buy Nest products. Similarly, Google Fiber’s ambitious roll-out was put on hold in late 2016 and then was effectively rebooted earlier this year, with talk of a far more conservative roadmap. You’d not know that to read Page’s comments, mind. “We have made significant investments in bringing gigabit fiber internet to lots of happy customers,” he writes, “and I’m excited about our opportunities to do it better.” Google X, which is led by Sergey Brin, gets little more than a footnote. Page highlights the Wing drone delivery service, though ignores the cancellation of Project Titan earlier this year, when the solar-powered internet spreading drone was grounded. Of course, it would be unusual for any founder to blast his business in a State of the Union, so Page’s positive spin is to be expected. Still, it remains to be seen whether investors respond as enthusiastically when it comes down to how much Alphabet’s more offbeat projects contribute – or otherwise – to its bank account.

Version 59 is now in the Dev Channel ahead of its general rollout, and the company has now confirmed that it will include native support for animated PNG files. PNG files are similar to GIFs in supporting transparency, but while animated GIFs are now ubiquitous, animated PNG (or APNG) files are still relatively uncommon. Unlike GIFs, APNG files support both 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency. This is a GIF representing a person who's extremely excited about animated PNGs. As 9to5Google reports, an enquiry on Google's Chromium bug reporting site was met with a response from a Google employee that confirmed upcoming support for APNG in the next version of the browser. One user asked: "Does this mean that Chrome will now have full apng support without extensions?" The response: "Yes, Chrome 59 animates animated PNGs without require any sort of browser extensions." Some browsers, such as Firefox, have included APNG support for some time, and Apple supports APNG in iMessage apps on iOS 10 too.

Send Feedback. It’s no wonder that there haven’t been more internet-paranoia movies since the advent of Google, Facebook, and your grandparents being online. Online media are so well-integrated into much of American life that thriller-level intrigue over privacy settings and search histories may seem, to digital natives, like dire warnings about the dangers of automobiles or microwaves: maybe not outright nutty, but potentially hysterical. On top of which, especially dedicated internet users tend to get defensive about some mere movie maligning a newer, shinier medium. It’s hard to make a film that’s critical of digital technology without sounding like a square. Photo: STX Entertainment It’s this uphill battle that The Circle fights for a little while, then loses about halfway through. Adapted by filmmaker James Ponsoldt (The End Of The Tour; The Spectacular Now) and novelist Dave Eggers from the latter’s novel of the same name, the movie follows Mae (Emma Watson) as she is granted access to the fantasy of many upwardly mobile young people: an entry-level job at a Google-like digital conglomerate. The Circle is like Google, plus more (not to be confused with Google Plus). It’s more transparent, with a single and verified “TrueYou” sign-on; more accommodating (“campus” amenities include a nightclub, a kennel, and a baking kitchen, among others); and perhaps even heavier on the corporate Kool-Aid, with high-ranking executive Bailey (Tom Hanks) giving weekly talks that are half internal product launch, half preaching to the converted. Mae, who has been working customer service for a utility company, is delighted with the opportunity to, well, still work customer service, but someplace with nicer computers, measurable outcome metrics, and a chummy, familial vibe. She’s a few weeks on the job before she’s pushed to spend more time at the office—non-mandatory-but-kind-of-mandatory fun, of course—and realizes that everyone seems to know about how her parents (Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton) are dealing with her dad’s MS. Every facet of her life, it seems, is subject to unsolicited crowdsourcing. Even when she’s taken aback by these invasions of privacy, Mae goes with the flow, while her plain-folks childhood friend Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) grumbles about wanting to make connections in person, where he can look people in the eye. Coltrane essentially plays the part as if his Boyhood character progressed no further than where that movie left him, and whether it’s his relative inexperience as an actor or the thin writing of this part (most likely both), Mercer comes across as a hilariously insufferable excuse for a moral center. He and Mae are purported to have gone on “adventures” in the past, but apart from woodworking in isolation and looking people in the eye, Mercer’s main interest seems to be maintaining a surly superiority over anyone who checks email more than twice a day. His counterpoint-issuing function in the narrative is decidedly low-tech. Photo: STX Entertainment Mercer feels especially unnecessary because Ponsoldt shows that he can convey a lot of information with profile-page speed. Within about five well-edited minutes at the front, the movie touches upon Mae’s dead-end job, favorite hobby, family relationships, and ringtone without belaboring any of it. As she moves into The Circle (and the takes get longer and snakier), many smaller details continue to ring true, or at least funny. Mae’s initial interview, for example, goes into a “lightning round” that’s a cross between a BuzzFeed quiz and Scientology processing. Later, when the movie tilts more toward science fiction (or, more accurately, features technology that seems vaguely believable but is almost completely unexplained), it unveils its most lovingly realistic feature. Mae winds up with an extremely popular social media feed of sorts, and the endless Facebook-style comments make up a perfectly mixed on-screen stream of sudden adulation, snark, and asinine tangents. A passing resemblance to The Truman Show is the best thing the second half of The Circle has going for it. It’s around the halfway mark that the movie starts doling out muddled or awkward scenes, including its ill-advised decision to have the plot turn on a clumsily staged kayaking mishap. Watson doesn’t have much to work with because Mae seems so maddeningly easy to sway, and while Hanks uses his persona well as a businessman who endeavors to appear avuncular at all cost, he doesn’t have enough screen time to take his character any further. Poor John Boyega has it even worse; as a mysterious star programmer who skulks around the Circle campus, he spends a lot of time standing around in consternation. There are some interesting points somewhere in The Circle about how giant tech companies gussy up their overreaches as democratic victories for humanity and transparency. But this is a strange (and, given when the movie was written and shot, mostly unlucky) time to conflate transparency with the death of privacy. In another, more controlled movie, the lack of a clearly stated evil plan, or the lack of a corresponding good-guy plan to take it all down in a burst of Luddite revolution, would strike welcome notes of ambiguity. In The Circle, it’s more of a passable but ultimately unstructured airing of vague grievances.

About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Menu About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Search advertisement Homepage » e-learning » 5 reasons why you should participate in the Google Digital Skills Training program 5 reasons why you should participate in the Google Digital Skills Training program Posted 17 Mar 2017 by Trycolyn Pikirayi (@trycolynTP) Read 22 Comments I’m pretty sure one way or the other, you’ve heard about the digital skills training that Google has been conducting throughout Africa. Over the last two days, there has been talk on how the initiative has finally reached Zimbabwe. In light of this, I thought it important for me to just give you simple reasons (that you might have just overlooked) on why you should actually participate. 1. It’s free Well, I know that might sound silly but free doesn’t really mean much to Zimbos when it comes to tech related workshops (my observation at least and please feel free to prove me wrong). Unless of course there is free food and/or refreshments. Nonetheless, I personally feel like free things should really be taken advantage of. I guarantee you that the next time you want to learn this very content Google is offering, it will not be for free! Or maybe you-yourself will teach the content you acquired for free someday at a cost – it’s called business. 2. No qualification prerequisite Maybe some of you are familiar with the hassle of applying for a vacancy and the struggle of trying to make your qualifications sound like a cut above the rest. If you know what I’m talking about, then you know exactly why I put this as a reason to attend. Google, (as we know it) is offering digital skill courses and you do not need any qualifications to partake! Therefore, there is no restriction, any ambitious entrepreneur can benefit from this, regardless of educational background (which is not always a fitting criteria to use for most of us, but story for another day!). advertisement 3. Lessons applicable to any line of business The general perception is that only tech related businesses should participate, but that’s entirely misleading. Google acknowledges that the world is fast digitising, therefore, to remain relevant in any field, there is need for businesses and individuals to learn these skills and keep up. Luke Mckend, the Google SA country director testifies on how local businesses have been helped since the offered tools and technologies are basic enablers that can be applied to literally any line of business. In fact, this is an opportunity for individuals to leverage the internet in order to give their businesses an online presence which is much more robust than the traditional way of doing business. 4. Person to person training In as much as the content being learnt is being made available online (for now that is) g.co/digitalskills ,if there is a chance to actually meet face to face with the teacher, why not? Maybe I am still backward for being biased towards learning in the old fashioned classroom way, but I would take that over online any day only if it’s an available alternative. However, this point is mostly relevant to those who actually need the digital skills first to then know how to access online material. So this might not be relevant to you directly, but I’m pretty sure you know someone who suits this criteria perfectly and would really appreciate you telling him/her about it.   5. Certificate of attendance Who doesn’t want those? Considering how much of a tech giant Google is, a mere certificate of attendance will go a long way in authenticating your career/ cause.   Image credit: digitalskills.withgoogle.com Enjoyed this article?

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Buy Things With Google Home By Eric Ravenscraft on April 27th, 2017 Amazon may be leading the pack on buying things with your voice on the Echo, but that doesn’t mean Google is content to sit this race out. Depending on where you live, you can buy things with Google Home using Google Express. Here’s how to set it up. RELATED ARTICLES Amazon Echo vs. Google Home: Which One Should You Buy? Amazon Prime Is More than Free Shipping: Here Are All of Its Extra Features If you’re unfamiliar with Google Express, it works a bit like Amazon Prime. You can order a variety of items and have them delivered straight to your door. However, Google doesn’t have its own shipping warehouses of products like Amazon. Instead, Google will sell you items from other stores like Costco, PetSmart, Walgreens, Whole Foods, and more. Google coordinates with stores in your area to send you the items that those stores sell. When you buy things via Google Home, you can specify that you want to buy things from a certain store, or Google can choose a store for you automatically. First, Add a Payment Method and Delivery Address Before you buy stuff with your Google Home, you’ll need to set up how you’ll pay and where your stuff should go. To get started, open up the Google Home app and tap the menu icon in the top-left corner. Then, tap the “More settings” option.   Scroll down to the “Google Account settings” section and tap “Payments.” If this is your first time setting up a payment method with Google Home, you should see a screen like this one. Tap the big blue “Get Started” button to continue. Next, you’ll see the terms of service page. Click “Accept.”   If you’ve used Google to pay for anything from your account previously, you should see a list of the credit and debit cards you’ve added. Pick the one you want to use for your purchases. You’ll then be prompted to enter your CVV code. Alternatively, you can add a new credit or debit card and use that. Next, you’ll need to add your shipping address. Once again, if you’ve added an address to your Google account, you can choose it from a list, or you can add a new one. Finally, Google will ask you to confirm that you want to use this information on “shared devices” like Google Home. This is basically letting you know that anyone that can talk to your Google Home will be able to buy things from your account. That includes your family, friends, house guests, and news reports on TV. If you have multiple Google Home devices connected to your account, you can pick which ones you want to give this privilege to here as well. Once all that is set up, you’re ready to start ordering things through Google! Start Shopping From Google, Or a Specific Store Once your payment system is set up, you can start ordering things. To start an order, say something like “Ok Google, buy LR44 batteries.” Google will then read off the top search results and ask if you want to order that item. Say “Yes” to order, or “No” to get the next search result. At any point, you can say “Cancel” to stop the search. According to Google’s help documents, you can also specify a store if you prefer your batteries from a specific company. Simply say “Buy batteries from Fry’s” to only get results from your favorite store. If you’ve already bought an item, you can also say “reorder batteries” to place the same order again. Check out the chart above for the full range of voice commands you can use to order from Google Home. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Eric Ravenscraft covers smarthome tech for How-To Geek.

This is the USS Macon back in 1934. Photo: U.S. Navy If you’ve ever wondered how the technocrat gazillionaires actually use their power and influence, here is a little glimpse into that world: Sergei Brin, Google co-founder and Google Glass proponent, has been running airship project in secret. Advertisement The best part of this story, turned up by Bloomberg is that it’s not even clear if Brin is trying to make money off of this thing, or if he’s just running it for shits and giggles: Brin, the Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It’s unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. “Sorry, I don’t have anything to say about this topic right now,” Brin wrote in an email.﻿ I say that this is all reportedly as Brin himself told Bloomberg, “Sorry, I don’t have anything to say about this topic right now,” though Bloomberg seems pretty confident about its anonymous sources. Advertisement Bloomberg goes on to note that there’s already a metal skeleton of this thing out at the NASA Ames Research in Mountain View, CA. That’s where we built some airships back in the 1930s before we figured that a gigantic slow-moving bubble that hovered from one population center to another wasn’t a great idea. According to Bloomberg, this Brin-blimp (Brinp?) would be a giant-cargo-hauling helium balloon delivering parcels quietly and fuel-efficiently around the globe in place of planes. In summary: the guy supporting the invention of what can only be described as a Future Monocle is now trying to get blimps going again. I’m not going to rule out that this guy is simply obsessed with the turn of the century, as The Atlantic theorizes.

According to Check Point researchers, the trojanized apps were uploaded to the app store as early as November 2016, meaning they hid successfully for five months, accumulating an alarming 2 million infected users. “The malware… was hidden in more than 40 guide apps for games,” said researchers in an analysis. “Check Point notified Google about the malware, and it was swiftly removed from the app store. At the beginning of April, two new malicious apps were uploaded to Google Play containing this malware, and Check Point notified Google once again.” FalseGuide creates a silent botnet out of the infected devices for adware purposes, and it requests an unusual permission on installation—device admin permission—in order to avoid being deleted by the user. “The malware then registers itself to a Firebase Cloud Messaging topic which has the same name as the app,” researchers noted. “Once subscribed to the topic, FalseGuide can receive messages containing links to additional modules and download them to the infected device….the botnet is used to display illegitimate pop-up ads out of context, using a background service that starts running once the device is booted. Depending on the attackers’ objectives, these modules can contain highly malicious code intended to root the device, conduct a DDoS attack, or even penetrate private networks.” Mobile botnets are a growing trend since early last year, growing in both sophistication and reach. “This type of malware manages to infiltrate Google Play due to the non-malicious nature of the first component, which only downloads the actual harmful code,” Users shouldn’t rely on the app stores for their protection, and implement additional security measures on their mobile device, just as they use similar solutions on their PCs.

Report: Google Assistant bests rivals for questions answered and overall accuracy Cortana was second for questions answered, Alexa second-best for accuracy. Greg Sterling on April 27, 2017 at 2:02 pm More Alexander Supertramp / Shutterstock.com In January, Stone Temple Consulting released a virtual assistant consumer survey showing the majority of respondents wanted the assistants to provide “answers” rather than conventional search results. Today, the firm published a follow-up study that measured the relative accuracy of the four major assistants. It compared results of “5,000 different questions about everyday factual knowledge” on Google Home, Alexa, Siri and Cortana, using traditional Google search results as a baseline for accuracy. The following table shows the study’s top-line results. As one might have anticipated, the Google Assistant answered more questions and was correct more often than its rivals. Cortana came in second, followed by Siri and Alexa. Of the questions it could answer, Amazon’s Alexa was the second most accurate assistant. Siri had the highest percentage of wrong answers of the four competitors. (Apple is reportedly “finalizing” its Amazon Echo competitor.) Here’s Stone Temple Consulting’s summary of the outcome: Google still has the clear lead in terms of overall smarts with both Google search and the Google Assistant on Google Home. Cortana is pressing quite hard to close the gap, and has made great strides in the last three years. Alexa and Siri both face the limitation of not being able to leverage a full crawl of the web to supplement their knowledge bases. It will be interesting to see how they both address that challenge. One of the interesting observations in the report is about featured snippets. Cortana had more featured snippets integrated than any of the others, even Google Home, although Google search had more. Siri and Alexa lagged far behind in the category, although they want to use third parties to deliver “answers” and transactional capabilities. There’s a good deal more discussion of both the results and the study’s methodology on the Stone Temple blog.

Google's 'Trusted Voice' feature keeps turning off for some users Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/01/08 11:18am PDTJan 8, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 94 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News The OK Google command is great, but I think we'd all agree that it can be a little... temperamental at times. Our Glorious Leader Artem recently took to Google+ to air his grievances about Trusted Voice, the feature that recognizes your voice and unlocks your phone accordingly. What happens when Trusted Voice is off. Specifically, Artem was complaining about Trusted Voice automatically, and seemingly randomly, turning itself off. This is annoying because it means when asking Google Assistant, or Voice Search on non-Pixel phones, the phone has to be manually unlocked before it answers.   Left: as you can see, Trusted Voice is off. Right: the Trusted Voice setup phase. This may be a bug limited to the Google app v6.10 beta, but I've found it happens with versions prior to that on my Nexus 6P. I'll set Trusted Voice up, and it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month - but then one day I'll ask it to play some music or set a timer and it'll say 'I can't do that as your phone needs to be unlocked' or something similar. Rinse and repeat. If Google wants to be the leader in the voice assistant market, it's crucial Assistant works as intended. This means improving the reliability of the OK Google command and ensuring it works 100% of the time. We'd be interested to hear your comments on this, and see if it's related to specific phones or versions of the Google app. Let us know in the comments!

Randomly works at times and other times it simply doesn't. mbarna I've been experiencing this bug on a Nexus 5x throughout the summer of 2016. Haven't seen it crop up recently though. Gonzales It happens on my 5X as well. I was chalking it up to Action Launcher 3 but it still happens with no launcher active. Very frustrating Van_Hammersly Same here. Nexus 5X. Although it happened on Nexus 5 and previous phones as well. Always took a reinstall. Artem Russakovskii Your GIF at least shows the voice prompt and then the lock. With Assistant, you just see the lock, and the voice prompt only shows up after you unlock, which... well, is just as frustrating. Chris Ledbetter Mine on my pixel will show a message saying i have to unlock the device and the prompt is no longer up forcing me to do it all over again. SMH Not a big deal, just something that should be flawless from a search giant... The Fink it happens on Samsung phones as well. Arie Yup, this is happening to me for quite a while.. Nexus 6P, on 7.1.1 blassster This has happened to me before as well, most recently after applying this month's security patch. Anthony McCann Well, on the plus side, at least the voice command was for a good cause Ailín Ó’S This has always happened to me, it's never worked. I have my phone in Irish/Gaeilge and Google in English (Ireland). Goyam Jain This issue has been with me on the Galaxy Su Edge running Android Marshmallow since when I bought it in November. It sucks when it happens JPJ My XL works sporadically and I'm using the Jan update. John Doe Trusted Voice isn't even available on the Nexus 6. I believe it used to be there but I don't know what happened. JasonIvers Did anyone ever find out why the Nexus 6 doesn't have that option? I never did see a reason, just that it was the case. It generally doesn't affect me, as I have trusted devices most places I would actually consider using it. Noeltorious Used to be there, and if you toggled it on it would toggle itself back off. Must've been really broken for them to disable and then remove it digitalcircuit I've had a similar issue where "Say 'Ok Google' any time" keeps turning off a split second after I enable it. Checking logcat points to "AlwaysOnHotword start recognition failed with error 14" and "sound_trigger stdev_load_sound_model failed." Upgrading/downgrading Google Search doesn't help. Frustratingly enough, this was working fine for a month or two on CM 13.. then broke. Then worked again when upgrading to CM 14.1.. then broke a month later. Nexus 6. Logan Snyder I have a 5X, I haven't noticed trusted voice turning off randomly, but I've noticed the "Ok Google command" has a lower and lower recognition rate until it becomes abysmal and almost never recognizes the command. I have to retrain the voice mondel like once a month. chinna_rao I've been having this problem with my device for quite some time but then, it just blew up when I repeatedly tried "OK Google" ing it...Samsung Note 7 matteventu "it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month" You are lucky then. With Pixel XL it happens that you setup the "Ok Google" always on and as trusted voice, and after HOURS it stops responding, forgetting the "vocal-training" you made. And there's no a toggle for this, you have to reinitiate every fu**ing time the vocal setup. Ernie Mine is fine sproc Well at least your fingerprint reader still exists, lol. Some of these issues are like Win9x era crap. ehTuBrutus Happens to me Everytime I switch between user accounts. Gives me a pop-up saying it has been turned off so I took it to be by design. I take it others have it happening even when not switching accounts? I wonder if Artemis has more than one user açcount on his phone? Andrew Palmer I used it to skip a track the other day. I didn't like the next track either so tried to do OK Google again. No response. Joe Mihalich I experienced this twice on the first day I received my pre-ordered Pixel XL. After i retrained it the second time, it hasn't happened again. Lucky me. Now if they would just fix the stupid freeze/lockup issue i can get on with my life. Brian Demodulated Trusted Voice is always turned on for me but often when I give a voice command I'm prompted to unlock my phone before the command is executed. So annoying. whispy_snippet Yep, I experience all of the above on my Pixel. Sucky. shamatuu yep nexus 6P. been turned off on its own for couple of months and yet Google seems to not care to fix it. really hope they fix it ASAP because they not what they used to be. blakeleeper Its happening on my Pixel XL v6.10.33.21 Kwetsima Maluleke Its been doing this to me for ages. About a year maybe. David Hyman Me too but it has been working a lot better for me for a while now Sharondhart Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Les Deplorables Yep...ages here too! Annoying. Michael Gerberich I have a similar issue with Trusted places. It works for a while and then just stops working. S7 Edge. vwnut13 Didn't OK Google used to work with a locked screen? Jimas Happens on my Nexus 6P Google v6.10.33.21. It started happening maybe a week or two ago, but it resets almost like every 2-3 days. Zaptor99 On my Note 4, I don't have Trusted Voices, I have "Personal Results". I turned it on. But If I go to Maps, Settings, Navigation, Ok Google, then the same screen from google app appears, but instead of "Personal Results", I see "Trusted Voice" and it's turned off and it then automatically turns off "Personal Results" in google app. Very confusing. Grey Are we reporting bugs on AP now? Because there are tons of bugs to report, especially with Google Now. It doesn't make sound anymore for one. If your phone is in landscape mode and you get it to turn on, it will turn on then stop because it's in landscape mode and you have to repeat it. Not to mention it does not respond every time. And try saying "remind me tonight dentist appointment at 11 am", cause what it will give you is a reminder for "tonight dentist appointment" due at 11 am. It's got issues. We gonna call them on all of it and try and get some pressure on Google to fix stuff? You gotta do it AP, we can't. Ibrahim Yusuf It happend for me on my nexus 5x on marshmallow, even updating to nougat didn't fix it. But I fixed it by deleting the voice model and retraining again. I got an answer on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/5bgngq/cant_activate_always_on_ok_google_voice_detection/ Amir This is not new. I've been having this issue since the beginning of 2015 on my Nexus 6, 6P and now on Pixel XL. Ive completely given up on that feature. opticalgenesis Same here :( - also bonus points for Muse Himesh Kulkarni Same problem here but works less than a month, maybe like a few days. Also, I don't get any reply, it's just blank (doesn't work). Peter Me: "OK Google" Pixel: "Bleep" Me: "Read last message" Pixel: "You have one last message, would you like to hear it?" Me: "Yes" Pixel: "OK, cool, cool." ... Me: "WTF?" Andre Only once this has happened on my Nexus 5X. I have not experienced this issue in a while. jack_k1 I absolutely loath saying"OK Google". It just doesn't roll off the tongue. I feel like I'm gargling. demarcmj Even if it did "roll off the tongue," four syllables is just way too much. Fatty Bunter Google Home accepts "Hey google" too, which is much better. Hopefully they'll add this to phones too. Cory S Hey Google has a much lower activation rate than Okay Google for me, which is a shame because I hate that hot phrase. jack_k1 Try using Trusted Face when you have a long flowing beard. Hah! nxtiak YES!!! My Pixel XL suffers this issue, so f'ing annoying, I thought I was going crazy! JimOnTheBeach Yes happens on my new LG V20.i thought I was doing something wrong. Shawna Bartron This has never worked for me. LG Stylo 2 Travis James I don't have this issue, but I will keep yelling at my phone when driving "OK Google" with no response. When I have a chance to pick up my phone and unlock, I see that it can't reach Google, even though I have connectivity. Super annoying. Brandon Buchanan I use this feature all the time, but never have trouble with it on my Nexus 5x. King_Android Expect bugs with Beta. Uninstall beta clear data enable using default Google now launcher and all is well. catalysto For as long as I've had my 6P, I've had a similar problem. After a week or so, saying "OK Google" with the screen off stops working. If I toggle the settings off and back on, it works again for a while. But then usually by the time I actually need it, it has stopped working again. I gave up on it and just use the microphone button now for voice commands. Van_Hammersly It's done this to me on at least three separate phones over the past few years. Random and annoying. Each time I think when I get a new phone it'll stop doing it, foolishly. Parneet Singh It always does after few days on my nexus 5 X. Ok google stops responding to voice commands dmo580 That's not the same as Trusted Voice turning off. You're talking about OK Google detection just failing. The screenshots here specifically show the toggle being turned off. Let's not mix up two issues. Yvonne Campbell I have this issue as well, where both the 'trusted voice' and 'detection from any screen' toggles get turned off. gtoninn I have had the same thing happen to me. In addition to that the most recent update to the Google app has left my manually requested google searches with voice (IE I hit the voice search button), getting stuck and then the Google App has to be restarted. Also on a 6P Pyrazol You mention this now? It's been doing that to me for AGES. I thought switching from the Moto X to the Nexus 6 would ease my woes, but nooo. I just don't use that shit anymore because it's so freaking unreliable. dmo580 You don't even have trusted voice on the Nexus 6 as an option in the Google App. Keep in mind this issue is a very specific one regarding trusted voice. Moto's own implementation of always on listening is different as they pay for the license themselves. Cypress Frankenfeld Has anyone logged an issue on the Android bug tracker? I'd gladly star it. Joe Mine's always done this, it just randomly stops working. I always thought it was just because of updates causing it to shut down and needing to be reactivated. sea_hawk I have the same issue for a month. after I joined the 7.1.1 beta and then left the beta, but still experiencing the issue. sea_hawk Never mind... just tried enabling it, and it finally let me do that... not sure what happened. But in the past when I tried enabling trusted voice, it would ask me to input my pattern, but after I do that, the button stays "off"... sorry, not of much help HotRodJohnson Welcome to the world of the Nexus 6 users. The forum for this feature says, Hey Nexus 6 user, you can forget about it! Noeltorious I actually have a similar issue on the Pixel XL. I'll say OK Google and it will wake the screen up and show me the lock screen. Subsequent OK Google's or swiping to launch from the lock screen just point me to use my fingerprint to login. Once I use the fp-sensor the screen unlocks with Assistant launched. Weird and annoying, haven't figured out steps to reproduce because it's so random I don't think it's toggling off though because I never have to toggle anything on to fix it. RecalcitrantOne Just commenting to echo what others have said, happens to me and my 5x. Wouldn't mind being able to set my own "hot phrase." Either way, the emphasis is wrong with "Okay Google." The emphasis is on the second syllable of okay, but first for Google so it's not smooth. Rob I also noticed it deactivated many times, making it unreliable (Nexus 6P 7.1.1). It's been deactivating since the summer but it's a few weeks it hasn't anymore. I hope this gets addressed. Ashlynn This happens for me. Google Pixel version 7.1.1 - Google version 6.10.36.21amd 64. This recently started happening for me. Had no issues a few weeks ago. Chris Tashjian Same here!! It's been resetting on me daily for the last couple weeks jaxjoe Same issue with my PixelXL - was working up until 2-3 weeks ago. Now it doesn't stay turned on for more than a few hours at a time Luke Taylor Ohhhhhh yeah. It'd happened to me only 4 or 5 times on my 6P in the last year, but suddenly in the past two weeks it's happened to me about 6 times- which is how I found this article just now. Come on, Google! stephen Galaxy s7. turns off in middle of voice searches and even while I'm typing in a search. Annoying to have to start typing all over again! Version 6.0.1 Niels Buekers I get this on my Pixel XL since a week or 2.. nikov I've had it happen a few times in the past on my Nexus 6P, but it has become very common in the last month or two. I'm running in to real issues with it at this point. bryguy76 I have a Pixel XL, worked fine for the first month, and then started turning off all the time. It's so annoying. Miguel Dey My pixel just started doing this.. any fix for it yet? Random! LG G3 D855, stock fw. Started happening to me a few days ago. Now this feature freaks out every couple days. Russ We have two Pixels and both do this. It's infuriating. It'll work flawlessly some days and then sometimes we'll say "OK, Google" and just get the lock screen and then go into the settings and find Trusted Voice has turned itself off arbitrarily. Trueblue711 It must be a bug with Google Play services. I'm one of the very few people with a Nexus 6p still running Android 6.0 and this bug happens to me all the time. Ronny Keller Disabling "Battery Optimization" for the item "ok Google enrollment" seems to do the trick for some users. Aaron Kelly I hope this does the trick. I'm trying it. It makes sense. Joe Mihalich This is still happening to me with google app 6.10.37.21. Kris Tyler This is happening at least monthly on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Then it makes me retrain it and opt in. EVERY FREAKING TIME. So annoying, especially when it won't dial numbers when I'm driving. It's enough to make me consider an Apple. Al It happens on Pixel too. I'm starting to wonder if it's anytime the phone restarts. SSt Me too. Nexus 6p Laksamana Just happened to me since last week (Galaxy S6 on Android 6.0.1). Kept asking me to opt back in into Trusted Voice. Andrew Slater I have a 6p on version 7.1.1 and it had been doing this for a month or 2. But instead of it turning off a couple months apart, it turns off after only a couple days. Very annoying. JC Pixel XL, Android 7.1.2, Google App version 6.12.19.21.arm64. Does this multiple times a day, multiple times a week. So annoying it's driving me crazy. Been this this since my Nexus 6P a year ago Austin Ingram So annoying. It stays on for maybe a day or two then it's off again. Austin Ingram It may be related to training it in noisy environments - if you do that then try to activate it when it's quiet it may not recognize your voice and disable it for "security". Ankit Sud It's happening frequently with my Pixel as well. Defeats the biggest use case for Assistant in my opinion. Kyle Bailey Still happening with my Pixel. Is there any fix? bluescrubbie Just spent a while on chat with Google support. They say they've fixed the issue and we'll be rolling it out in an update soon. Patrick Ledwith Really? That's a relief. Garth Hedley I have Nexus 6P and 7.1.1. so fault is not restricted to earlier Android versions. I've set up TV numerous times. Each time after phone locks, Google app voice says can't do that phone is locked. Tatyana Tatyana I turn it on and the same day the "Trusted Voice" option will turn itself off. Drives me fucking bananas. PeterDTown Infuriating! It seems that every time I try to use this feature it's turned off again. Katie Conforti Seems if you don't use your phone for 4 hours the setting gets disabled. So annoying, makes assistant nearly worthless. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en Aaron Kelly My 6p has been doing this for about the last month or two. Every 3-7 days it happens. It's frustrating. I use the Trusted Voice to dial all the time, so when it doesn't work because of something like this, it makes me mad. Shannon Doak It is happening with my Pixel as well. stsin 6P on fi started doing it after I went off the beta os test due to severe battery issues. Dušan Todorović "trusted voice" my ***. After setting it for who knows how many times, yesterday, when i wanted it to start Clash of clans, that annoying answer pulled my nerve with "actually i cant do that while the device is locked, please, unlock blablabla.." for the last time. I disabled it. Guys doing the Ok Google "magic", clearly this is happening for a while and to many people, independant of android version, root opt, device, launcher, gapps version, google+ version, etc. Either fix the darn thing or stop pretending to be Siri's competitor. This sucks big time. Simon Jude I have this exact problem! I'm on an LG K7, anyone actually know how to fix this? Paul Kopalek My Nexus 6P turns the 'Anywhere' feature off INSTANTLY when I turn it on. Even when wiping Google app data, clean flashing the 7.1.1 ROM all over again, and disabling Battery Optimization for 'OK Google Enrollment. This is infuriating. Dave Segal HTC One M8 and galaxy 7 Yvonne Campbell Yes!! It's not just my trusted voice that gets turned off but my detection from any screen. Suddenly I can't just say "ok google" and get a response without touching my phone. Rather defeats the purpose. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Another issue I'm having, but think it would be a phone issue, is that I have answer calls with voice commands turned on, and even though it stays turned on, it does not work anymore. PP Saini I have the opposite issue. The "any time" option will not stay off. I toggle it off, but am immediately able to say OK Google with my phone responding. Check the setting, and it is oddly back on. Kristina Starck Constantly on my Note 5. It also pops up a window asking me what I just said everytime I listen to anything with my headphones plugged in. Even disabling the assistant altogether doesnt stop the spam. Callahan Jason Droid Maxx 2 - used to turn off randomly, more recently I can not keep it on. If I switch it on back out to previous screen then go back-it will be off Salazryl Ismail I have this issue too on my SGS3 and HTC One M8 Jean-Sebastien Penney Same here about once a week Nexus 6p Stapin Does this on an LG KV8 as well.

Using multi-user media controls on Google Home: How it works Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:09am PDTApr 27, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 21 Share on Facebook 34 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Google Home News Tips & Tutorials Article Contents 1 Playing music 2 Playing YouTube videos on Chromecast 3 Playing movies and TV shows on Chromecast 4 Playing media on linked speakers and televisions 5 Guests and unlinked users in your house Now that Google has enabled multi-user support for Google Home, what can you do with your media? After a little research and a chat with Google Home support, I have the answer to that question. Keep in mind, this is the situation as of today. As we always do, we hope for these features to be fine-tuned and expanded. This article assumes each user has already linked up to the Google Homes in their household. This is an easy process that the Google Home app will walk you through for each multi-user equipped device. Playing music Google will let each user have their own default music provider. No more sharing your Google Play Music. Tapping the “Feeling Lucky?” card will no longer subject you to periodic blasts of your housemate’s heavy metal music mixed in with your preferred history of listening to R&B tracks. With this new feature, your Home will use your preferred service when you make a music request. You will still be able to use other linked services, including those attached to other users' accounts, by simply adding the name of the service to your request. Each user can select their default music provider. Let's go through some examples. Let me introduce you to Carolina and Eric, roommates living in a condo with three Google Homes. Carolina's default music service is Google Play Music and Eric's is Spotify. Each have their own premium accounts. Here are some sample requests and what would result from them. Request Result Carolina requests a playlist without specifying a service Home plays the playlist using her Google Play Music account Carolina requests a playlist and ends it with "on Spotify" Home plays the playlist using Eric's Spotify account Eric requests a playlist without specifying a service Home plays the playlist using his Spotify account Eric requests a playlist and ends it with "on Google Play Music" Home plays the playlist using Carolina's Google Play Music account As you can see, one of the great benefits here is that both users have access to the other's premium account. Carolina and Eric can play each other's playlists if they know the playlist's name. Service generated playlists are also available to both. In addition to these services, you can also link Pandora (free or premium) and YouTube Music to users' accounts. During my testing, I discovered an interesting flaw (or feature?) that Google was unaware of. I found out that, using my example users, if Eric is playing a track on Carolina's Google Play Music and tells Home that he likes it, it will be added to Carolina's "Thumbs Up" list. It works the same for Spotify. If Carolina says she likes a song on Eric's Spotify account, it's marked as liked on Eric's account. Both of these actions will affect the associated playlist and influence auto playlists. A representative at Google Support told me they were sharing this issue I encountered with their developers. At the time of this writing, the flaw still exists - so be nice to the other users in your household or find your "Thumbs Up" playlist full of hated tracks. Eric's heavy metal taste infiltrates Carolina's preference for pop hits. Playing YouTube videos on Chromecast When it comes to video, the situation is similar to music but the amount of voice control is limited. Making requests to play videos from YouTube with no further specification will play media based on the individual's YouTube account. Each individual's watch history will be updated accordingly. There is no crossover. Furthermore, you can't like or dislike videos through the Home, so that mix of tastes you see with music won't happen. Playing movies and TV shows on Chromecast Currently, the only premium movie and TV service supported is Netflix. Your Home will play from your linked Netflix service or, if you didn't link one, it will play from the Netflix account of another linked user. In other words, Netflix is shared across all users. You can't like or dislike Netflix media from the Home. Simple. Playing media on linked speakers and televisions Here is where it the doors are wide open. All users' speakers, TVs, and speaker groups are shared across all users. By trailing your request with a specific device or named group, the media will be directed there. If Carolina has defined a speaker group named "Chill Zone" that includes her Chromecast audio connected to her stereo receiver and the Home in her bathroom, any user can send media to that group. That sounds like a great way for Eric to wake her up at 5:00am just for fun. Guests and unlinked users in your house If an unlinked user, such as a visitor, makes a media request, the Google Home will use the service associated with the first person who linked their voice to that Google Home. The media services connected by this person become the default services. If a request is made using a service that the first user has not set up, the service set up by another user will be used. Carolina was the first to link her voice on each Google Home. She doesn't have a Netflix account but Eric has linked his Netflix account in the Google Home app. If a request to play music is made without specifying a service, it will play from Carolina's Play Music account. If a request to play a movie on Netflix is made, it will use Eric's Netflix account. The Google Home app has a separate process for linking your voice. Here is where it seems Google has dropped the ball (again?). There is no way to identify who the first linked voice belongs to using the Home app. Google's help page literally tells you to poll all the users in your house to determine who linked their voice first: This user is likely the person who set up Google Home, but may not be if that person hasn't linked their voice. There is no way to tell who first linked their Google Account and voice from within the Google Home app. You must ask all linked users when they linked their Google Account and voice to be sure who is the first person. Here's how to manage linked users. So, if you are adding Homes to your household over time, you'll have to call a meeting and do an investigation if you happen to have forgotten this important fact. Alternatively, you can reset your Homes and systematically set them up again. Once you have everything set up, the media sharing is a nice feature that moves Google Home another step forward. Just don't ask it to remind you to buy milk. It's still learning. Source: Google Tags google home Google Music netflix spotify youtube subscribe ...

Is that possible or do they have to use different services like you gave in your example? David Ruddock It should work fine. It recognizes your voice and would use your account. snowglyder I'm guessing the same for Google Music. We have a Family Shared Plan, but currently when my wife or kids are at home and tell Google Home to play something, it stops playing for me at work because it's limited to one device at a time. It'd be awesome if my wife asked Google Home to play a song, it would use her Google Music account. Paul Quinn I'm betting that this is all tied up in licensing agreements for the music and how it is allowed to be played. bekifft This particular scenario actually sounds like a bug since it's inconsistent with the behavior the rest of the time, defaulting to the most premium service available. That or the multi user isn't set up yet. Aaron Berlin What if an unrecognized third person gives a command? Which account does it use and can that be changed? David Ruddock This is addressed in the unlinked user section. Paul Quinn If you mean media requests, that's covered in the last section of the article. Aaron Berlin That's what I get for trying to multi-task! Itchy_Robot Can I ask it to play individual songs or albums through Google Music yet... or does it still only play pre-made Playlists? Paul Quinn Sure you can. That's been possible all along. Only tracks and albums in Google's catalog though. rslh I uploaded all my songs (not on Play Music catalog) and grouped them in separate Playlists, and GH is able to play my songs from these different playlists! It's really sweet! Paul Quinn Yes. Although one snag is you can't call up individual tracks or albums from your personal library if they aren't in Google's catalog. You have to put them in a playlist to get to them like you did. Google is aware of this but no word in when. mesername So, what if I have a premium Google Play Music account and my roommate has a regular Google Play Music account? If she gives a command to play some song, can it default to my more expansive same service? David Ruddock This is a good question. Paul Quinn I did not test this scenario but based on all the testing I did, i think it would opt into your premium account. I would have to test it later. I'm not sure if you can call on someone's service by name. If you don't say something like, "... On Eric's Google Play Music account," it's going to go for the premium account of the first linked voice. There are a lot of possible scenarios. I couldn't test them all. mesername Understood. I agree, there are lots of ways Google could try to gracefully handle this. If her account doesn't have that song, it could look to another account that does, or it could just always default to the "most premium" version of the service. Like you said, it could also respond based on naming the user's account. Nobody said this was going to be easy...(stop reading here to avoid snarky comment)...except maybe Trump. I bet he would say, "I've got the best, the greatest voice actions...I know the most successful voices, and they'll always be clear, so clear, you won't believe how clear their voices are." Sorry, couldn't resist. Paul Quinn I just tried to test it but one of my Homes contains the name of the other person in my house. When I asked it to play his Google Play Music account, it interpreted it to mean playing Google Play Music on the Google Home with his name, not his account. There are just SO MANY permutations here. I didn't mention it my article but Google was not even aware of that thumbs up issue until I brought it to them. They can't even keep up with all the angles. I get it though. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm still waiting for Google to let us use Home to control media on Android TV. At the very least, give us the ability to play, pause, seek, stop, and control the volume of media of whatever is currently playing. Anything to reduce my reliance on that God-forsaken Shield TV remote, which I can never find in the dark half the time, is a blessing. youareme7 haha no joke, i lose it on the wood table right next to me, then of course i touch the volume bar and it starts blasting, mostly stick with the fire stick remote tho that doesn't do volume Cory S I'd like to be able to setup a default device for actions that require a display. Unless I specify otherwise play youtube videos and photos on TV X, don't just fail the command. pfmiller I think they should have a default playback device for each Home device. That way depending on which Home receives the request the video can play on the nearest TV. Paul Quinn That's an excellent idea. I have done a little testing in this area. It will not play to a chromecast unless I specify which one. It will ask me to be more specific and it's sitting about 3 feet from the TV I want it to pay on. HEY GOOGLE - READ THIS SUGGESTION! bekifft That is ridiculous it can't do that, but it can do Chromecasts. Voice control of video is one of the very few things I really like about this thing, that only it can do. Lars Jeppesen Has anyone managed to get multi user control working outside the States? I bought 3 GH, I'm located in Denmark, using US english as language on the GH.. but the multi-voice settings don't appear in the Home application... Would a VPN connection with my phone suffice, or do I have to fake my location as well? Wonder why Google has restricted this feature to US only.. so weird.. Cory S How accurate is it at correctly identifying users? My pixel would fail "okay Google" all the time for voice unlock because it couldn't match my voice. Paul Quinn That is a highly variable issue that depends on the amount of difference between voices in the household. I'm sure it works great between a male and female or an adult and child. Mine has two male voices linked and it has stated it can't identify which one it is a couple of times. However, the majority of the time, it is successful. I don't use voice unlock because I don't think it's secure enough. In your case though, I don't know why it's not working.

But Kim Scott, a former Google executive turned top CEO coach, met with the tech leader numerous times. One such meeting with Page almost went awry, and taught Scott a key leadership lesson. While leading Google's AdSense team several years ago, Scott was in a meeting with Page and former Google exec Matt Cutts, who now works on tech solutions for the U.S. government. According to Scott's account in her book "Radical Candor," Page was proposing a new plan, and Cutts apparently didn't agree with it. As Scott writes, Cutts allegedly started "yelling" at Page, the billionaire co-founder of the company. "I truly thought, 'Wow, here is a colleague I really respect and like raising his voice at Larry Page,'" Scott tells CNBC. "I thought he was going to get fired." But Page's reaction surprised her. Instead of raising his voice or getting angry, the tech leader simply grinned. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Larry Page "Not only did he permit Matt's challenging him," Scott says, "he seemed to relish it." The Google co-founder appreciated the feedback and challenge, Scott says. The three ended up having a productive and collaborative conversation, and Cutts, who was not fired, stayed at Google for years. Amazed, Scott decided to adopt Page's strategy, encouraging employees to speak up in meetings and offer her constructive feedback. Scott, who as a CEO coach has advised C-suite clients at Dropbox, Twitter and other top companies, says other leaders should encourage more open and honest conversations. When done in a professional manner, team members can share their knowledge and expertise in a way that makes their teammates more productive and leaders more informed. First Round Kim Scott, former Google exec and CEO coach. Scott isn't the only one has spoken about the benefits of honest and direct conversations. According to self-made millionaire and serial entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis, being able to form an argument for an idea and having the courage to state it — even to the point of challenging your boss — can make you stand out, in a good way. For Ursula Burns, chairwoman and former CEO of Xerox, having the courage to challenge a VP in a meeting, which she thought would get her fired, actually fast-tracked her career. As Scott writes, "Caring personally about people even as you challenge them will build the best relationships of your career." Cutts and Google's press team did not respond to request for comment show chapters Top Silicon Valley CEO coach: This is what separates the good bosses from the bad ones    Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 12:01 PM ET | 00:58 Video by Andrea Kramar Marguerite WardReporter, CNBC Make It Primetime Shows Watch full episodes | TV schedule To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Google Trips soon to include itinerary sharing and expanded reservation support Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:00pm PDTApr 26, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 35 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares86 Applications News Google has just pushed out a blog post that indirectly outlines a few changes to Google Trips. We reported last month that manually adding reservations and support for bus and train tickets had been added to the app. This latest post by Google shows off some additional features, like easy itinerary sharing and new reservation types like restaurants and car rentals. For those out of the loop, Google Trips is a pretty sweet way to keep all your itineraries and reservations together in one place on your phone. It includes the ability to save all the info offline, in case data might be limited wherever you are traveling. It can bug out, sometimes, doing things like placing reservations in duplicate trips, or just failing to properly crawl your email for reservations, but it's still a solid tool. Unfortunately these most recent feature additions — itinerary sharing, restaurant, and car rental support — aren't showing up for us quite yet, though they are demonstrated in Google's latest blog post. Itinerary sharing is probably the single most requested feature for Google Trips, and a more than welcome addition I know I want. Google's promotional images for the feature seem to show the app isn't using the standard icon to denote sharing, which is a bit inconsistent. If you'd like to take a look for yourself feel free at the Play Store or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Google Trips - Travel Planner Developer: Google Inc.

Ryne Hager There should be a "delete from google" option in the overflow menu when viewing a trip in-app. ike3232 it's a great app, in theory. but it actually isn't picking up my flight itinerary from my gmail. it is only picking up my hotel reservations. lame ipsofact I sent feedback about manually adding the sh1t.
