Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter. A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp., people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered “Essential” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and “computer operating software for mobile phones” among its goods and services. It’s unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin’s phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Alphabet Inc.’s new Pixel reside. It’s expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe’s most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google’s robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin’s next venture was a startup incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. “New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,” he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. “What’s the next platform?… It’s about data and people training AI systems to learn.” Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least $300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard Co., Google, and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin’s new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin’s phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus’s (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said. The startup is experimenting with enabling the phone’s screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin’s team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. Essential’s engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone’s functionality over time, one person familiar with the planning said. The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone. For instance, Rubin’s engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360 degree photographs, the person said. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter said, adding that all of the plans are still in flux. Technology news website The Information earlier reported Rubin was working on a phone. Helping run the project are former Google colleagues and Apple managers, including Rebecca Zavin, Joe Tate, Linda Jiang, and Jason Keats. Zavin, a former senior Google software manager, is running software for Rubin. Keats and Tate are helping run hardware engineering, and Jiang is a key designer for Essential, according to a person familiar with the startup. Kelly Liang, a former business executive with the Google X lab, is managing business development and Brian Wallace, a former Samsung and Magic Leap executive, is leading marketing.

Illya Marchenko was relentless for two sets, making life very difficult for the world No1, breaking his serve three times in eight to begin. But from there, Murray found a way out of the second set, then pressed home the advantage to finish it off in a relative stroll. Far from his most fluent outing, but ultimately doing what he had to do. That, I suspect, is all that matters for those of you waking up in the UK. Your boy is through in straight sets, and has taken the first in a long series of steps required over the next fortnight to win his first Australian Open title.

Not wrong, but to be fair to Murray he did fight back well from the moment he went down a break in the second set. Broader point would be that he shouldn’t be losing the plot quite as easily as he did earlier on. The final service game gets to 30-all, the motions gone through by both, the match closed out when Marchenko pings it long. And that’s it! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.03am EST 02:03 Third set: Murray 7-5, 7-6, 5-2 Marchenko* (*denotes server): A straightforward service game for Marchenko, Murray reluctant to expend any unnecessary energy at this stage.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.00am EST 02:00 Third set: Murray *7-5, 7-6, 5-1 Marchenko (*denotes server): One more for the Marchenko highlight reel. He doesn’t get a chance to play on this stage very often, and can be proud of that lobbed winner. It brought a smile to his face. But it didn’t do that much damage, Murray given a short ball to put away at 40-30. Sure enough, he obliged. One game away. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.57am EST 01:57 Third set: Murray 7-5, 7-6, 4-1 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Error after error from Marchenko. He looks spent. And he’d be weighed down as well by the opportunities he threw away in the second set. Sure enough, a break point comes and is secured when the Ukrainian whacks the ball out when attempting a tired forehand. Murray in the final stretch here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.54am EST 01:54 Third set: *Murray 7-5, 7-6, 3-1 Marchenko (*denotes server): Easy points for Murray to 40-0, the third of which an ace out wide. Marchenko reviewed - he has to - but the technology confirms that the line was clipped. The Brit does the rest. The support box copping less stick from their boy now. #7TENNIS 🎾 (@7tennis) Relief for 🇬🇧 @andy_murray as he manages to secure the break to lead a tiring 🇺🇦 @imarchello 2-1 in the third #AusOpen #7TENNIS pic.twitter.com/mPvzcpQqyx January 16, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.49am EST 01:49 Third set: Murray 7-5, 7-6, 2-1 Marchenko* (*denotes server): After battling so hard for so long, Marchenko is just about gone here, evidenced by two double faults. Murray didn’t miss the chance to attack, claiming a break from deuce when the Ukrainian pushed a forehand crosscourt a tad too far. The shadows are creeping over Rod Laver Arena, the match having lasted nearly two and a half hours. Surely the world number one will run through this set fairly easily from here and be out of here inside three hours.

A rare ace in that game as well, which will encourage him as both players will surely start labouring. It isn’t streaming hot out there, but it is warm enough.

Murray fumed at his support staff periodically while missing far more opportunities than those he took. Marchenko ran to the net repeatedly to put the Scot under pressure, but lacked the necessary polish to finish him off after an early break. A tie-breaker was required, Murray’s big serve and forehand combination coming good at long last.

First three points against serve then Murray up 4-1, but the sixth point ends after a long rally with a Marchenko winner. Murray is angry for not hitting a winner himself when the opportunity came earlier in the slogathon, not hitting it hard enough.

There is no doubting who the crowd are with based on that game, Marchenko smashing a forehand winner down the line at 30-15 much to their joy. But a forehand slice next up is ill-considered and into the net. But he held his nerve again, landing another forehand winner to win his way into the decider for the set. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.17am EST 01:17 Second set: *Murray 7-5, 6-5 Marchenko (*denotes server): It’s taken nearly two hours, but finally some Murray genius. Looking in the hole, and at deuce a second time, he get out of the service game after executing a picture-perfect forehand lob over Marchenko who came to the net to try and find a way through. The game should have been wrapped up by Murray way back at 40-15, but the Ukrainian landed a crosscourt forehand to keep on track, before getting on a roll. The result: he has to serve to stay in the set again. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.08am EST 01:08 Second set: Murray 7-5, 5-5 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Nerve held by Marchenko, after it looked quite the opposite as he second-guessed himself at 30-15, pulling out of a smash and clobbering long. But Murray went long himself to give him the game point, and he made no mistake putting away a volley after a sound serve. Has to be a tie-breaker here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.03am EST 01:03 Second set: *Murray 7-5, 5-4 Marchenko (*denotes server): Murray holds. He went down 15-30 early, but smashed his way out of trouble, forcing three consecutive Marchenko errors from the back of the court - who will now serve to stay in the set. That happened fast.

A big deflection off the net ended the final rally after a game of plenty of emotion, both players roaring upon winning a point. Murray was deflated early when missing a forehand at 15-all, but his opponent then did the same, before giving a break point with a poor backhand. Tit for tat with errors but forced and unforced. But we’re back on serve, Murray helped too by it not being a change of ends, able to quickly capitalise on the momentum of the break-back. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.52am EST 00:52 Second set: *Murray 7-5, 3-4 Marchenko (*denotes server): Murray is very fortunate there to hold on, it requiring four deuce attempts after Marchenko landed winners with the backhand down the line then across the court. But the fortune for Murray came at the end. A serve was called long, but the Scot challenged it - on the proviso that if the technology ruled it in that he would win the point, consulting the chair umpire on this point. He did, and it was. There’s a bit of confusion on the TV call as to whether he’s allowed to make that inquiry when deciding if he goes upstairs. Murray, it’s also observed on the TV, is talking to his support staff after every point. They won’t be making a commemorative DVD of this one. So scrappy. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.42am EST 00:42 Second set: Murray 7-5, 2-4 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Big fist pump from Marchenko’s coach when Murray’s backhand goes into the net at 40-30. Three winners on the forehand side belies the pre-game intel that it was his backhand that Murray had to be most aware of. His volleys are especially effective when racing to the net more by the game.

Not a flattering game, all points were the product of errors. It’s turning into a right scrap here. Murray remains a break down, but Marchenko is still plenty of pressure himself. All told, Murray has been broken in three of his first eight service games. Not for nothing. But the pressure back onto the Ukrainian, needing to keeping winnings gams with his relatively fragile serve. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.32am EST 00:32 Second set: Murray 7-5, 1-3 Marchenko* (*denotes server): “Bizarre behaviour” is the observation on the TV commentary. “It has cost him this game... it is concentration.” Murray is filthy again as Marchenko closes out his service game via winners with his forehand and backhand after Murray twice hit into the net. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.28am EST 00:28 Second set: *Murray 7-5, 1-2 Marchenko (*denotes server): Murray broken! A crosscourt forehand winner from the back of the court gave Marchenko his first point against Murray’s serve this set. He converted this small window into four points on the spin, the last a forehand winner down the line executed perfectly. Can he keep his nerve and consolidate the break? Updated at 12.29am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.22am EST 00:22 Second set: Murray 7-5, 1-1 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Marchenko’s first point of the set comes at 0-15, but he has to work hard for it with a couple of smash attempts, Murray scrambling well. He then comes to the net with rapid pace to nail a little crosscourt backhand volley. That’s real pretty. And he closes out the game with a big serve down the middle that Murray barely gets a racquet on. Gotta admire this guy’s resilience. Updated at 12.29am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.19am EST 00:19 Second set: *Murray 7-5, 1-0 Marchenko (*denotes server): Is it the case that after doing so much to get back into that first set that Marchenko will struggle to stay with Murray now? It’s world number one’s easiest service game yet, his opponent not able to get into any point. A couple of winners, a couple of errors. Updated at 12.29am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.16am EST 00:16 FIRST SET: MURRAY 7 - 5 MARCHENKO The Ukranian is extremely unlucky not to get that set into a tie-break. Murray is rusty. And angry. Marchenko is far less polished, and prone to disappointing errors, but utterly committed to the cause. It isn’t pretty, but it is a good little contest. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.14am EST 00:14 First set: Murray 7-5 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Hard not to feel for the Ukrainian here, who does so much right before routinely making rally errors. Murray is sitting back and waiting, knowing by now that it will surely come. In turn, he earns a set point at 30-40. And it happens again, missing long. He’s won the set. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.11am EST 00:11 First set: *Murray 6-5 Marchenko (*denotes server): To the net again goes Marchenko, profiting from a Murray error early in the game. He nearly does it again from close-range after a lengthy rally at 30-15 but misses. The crowd let out a big sigh when the ball is signalled out. They’re picked their guy, and fair to say it isn’t the Brit. He needs to dig deep with his second serve, and gets a bit of luck after a poor backhand error from his opponent, but Murray is first to six and Marchenko will again be serving to stay in the set. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.03am EST 00:03 First set: Murray 5-5 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Murray was right before the game about his opponent today being a scrapper. He’s excellent here again, chasing down balls all over the court gets the game to 30-all. Vision of Murray from the change of ends comes on the TV of him saying that phrase over and again “shocking movement.” It’s a proper tantrum. Meanwhile, Marchenko gets to 40-30 after putting away a volley, then wins the game with a big wide ace. All of a sudden, we’re level at five games all! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.59pm EST 23:59 First set: *Murray 5-4 Marchenko (*denotes server): That’s the break back! Excellent game from the lesser-fancied man. It began with a long rally and an error from Marchenko. To be fair to Murray, he forced him into the passing shot after attacking the net. Should have done better, but hit it into the net himself. Makes it 15-all. Murray is kept to the back of the court with the Ukrainians hard-hit backhand, eventually making an error himself. He’s serving for the set but a bit of work to do then from 15-30. An easy point brings parity at 30, but deft touch at the net at the end of another rally generates a break point. Murray is good enough to see it off with a big serve, but another break point comes after Marchenko slays a backhand winner down the line, shot of the set so far. A chance to get back on serve... and he takes it! A break back and we are on serve. Another winner down the line, just falling in. Rewarded for gutsy tennis. Andy Murray is fuming at the change of ends according to the commentary. “Shocking movement,” he is reported to have said time and time again. What’s that all about, I wonder?

Adam Hirst is into it on the email, observing that it was more Steve Harmison than Andy Murray (poor old Harmy, always getting tagged with that) in the first game. But now? More this, he says. Elegant. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.46pm EST 23:46 First set: *Murray 5-2 Marchenko (*denotes server): Huge Murray serve to begin, an easy point. But Marchenko has every right to fist pump when making a lovely little crosscourt forehand. Murray is back on top soon enough, his serve too powerful. At 40-15 Marchenko sends a decision upstairs in hope as much as anything, but the technology confirms the call. He will now serve to stay in the set. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.43pm EST 23:43 First set: Murray 4-2 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Comfortable start to Marchenko’s game before a familiar theme plays out - the Ukrainian missing long at the end of an attritional rally. 15-all. He makes a smash then lands a powerful first serve, giving the chance to serve it out at 40-15. He needs both attempts, but gets the game when Murray flays a forehand long.

Murray wraps up an easy service game. Updated at 11.44pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.36pm EST 23:36 First set: Murray 3-1 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Marchenko won just the seven games against Murray when they met here in the second round of 2011’s Australian Open. It’s a crisp serve/put away to begin this service game after the change of ends. But sure enough, a double fault isn’t far away. Plenty of those so far. Murray comes off best in a long rally as well, Marachenko missing long. Murray afforded two break points, he needs only one when the lower-ranked man tries get the top seed running, but is wide by a foot or more. Updated at 11.44pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.31pm EST 23:31 First set: Murray* 2-1 Marchenko (*denotes server): The most physical rally to date goes to the world number 93, Murray unable to return a backhand when stretched wide. Another rally favours the same man, set up for a couple of forehand smashes by Murray, nailing the second. But from 30-all to 40-30 when Murray nails a 208kph ace down the T. And game when he goes it again. Much better. Got there the hard way, but we’re on serve. Jasveer Jassi on the email reports that he’s just woken up in the middle of the night to watch Murray. “Should be an easy match,” he predicts. Presumably written before it began. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.26pm EST 23:26 First set: Murray 1-1 Marchenko* (*denotes server): Marchenko catches the bug, double faulting himself after missing a backhand. When hitting a forehand volley into the net he’s given Murray the chance to break right back from 0-40. He does exactly that, at the first time of asking, when he whacks a second forehand into the net in succession. Terrible tennis everywhere to begin. Updated at 11.31pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.24pm EST 23:24 First set: Murray* 0-1 Marchenko (*denotes server): Murray broken right away! A shocking start for the world number one, three double faults allowing the game to drift to deuce, before missing long twice. His first serve is all over the place in particular, abusing himself into the effects mics to the amusement of the commentary team. Don’t think anyone expected that. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.18pm EST 23:18 Andy Murray has won the toss. He’s elected to bat. Only kidding. He’ll serve. This will be the first time that Murray has played under “Sir Andy” since getting the new title over New Year. “The Knight of the Realm” he is introduced by the courtside announcer on the way out. In the lead up to the tournament Murray said he would be more than happy to just stay Andy, subtly discouraging too much officialdom at the Open. On the basis of that carry on, it appears they will be ignoring that though. (Cringe). The warm up looks to be done. So we’ll be away in a couple of minutes.

Some context on what we have ahead. In 2016 Murray was the first in the same calendar year to win a Grand Slam (his second Wimbledon), the World Tour Final, a Masters 1000 title and Olympic Gold. And yes, he has a Davis Cup in the kit-bag too, a US Open crown, a few Sports Personality of the Year gongs. Oh, and a Knighthood. But he hasn’t won here. Five times the finalist, never the top dog. The most recent four of those were because Novak Djokovic got in the way, including the decider both last year and in 2015. Twelve months ago was one of the rougher nights Murray has experienced on tour, blown away in straight sets then racing to the airport unsure whether he would make the birth of his first child (thankfully, he did). His ascension to top of the pops comes after winning the Paris Masters 1000 event in November, then knocking off his great rival Djokovic in London at the end of year Tour Final to confirm the ranking. The draw here dictates that the earliest they could face off this time time around would be in week-Sunday’s final. We should be so lucky. What about the other guy, you ask? Well, it is Ukranian journeyman Illya Marchenko. The same age as Murray at 29, but a very different lot in his tennis life, the right-hander a staple of the secondary satellite circuit. In saying that, his most recent Grand Slam appearance was his best, reaching the fourth round at Flushing Meadows in 2016, knocking off Nick Kyrgios in the process, before falling to Stan Wawrinka. At Melbourne, Marchenko’s best performance was in 2011 where he reached the second round. Who ended his run then? What do you know: Andy Murray. The victor that day, in straight sets, doesn’t recall much about the contest, but knows that the Ukranian - once ranked 49th in the world - has a decent backhand, and scraps hard from the backcourt. The way these two are viewed by the broader tennis world was no better illustrated than yesterday. Murray was given the chance to warm up on Rod Laver Arena - centre court at Melbourne - while Marchenko was told to find himself a back court. Tweeting his frustration about the inconsistency, he received support from an unlikely ally: Murray’s brother Jamie. Nice touch, I thought. Right. I can report that the weather at Melbourne Park is absolutely perfect for tennis, 29 degrees now and heading to a forecast high of 31 while these two are out there. That’s 88 in the old money if reading from the United States. I look forward to your company throughout the course of the match. We’ll be expecting the players for their hit up in about ten minutes. For now? Let’s chat. Predictions, proclamations, tell me how you’re seeing it. Adam.Collins.Freelance@theguardian.com for considered views, @collinsadam your hotter takes.

A Waikato software specialist maintained its leading edge when it beat early adopters to new technology nearly six months before the final version was released generally to the world. Analyst developers at software specialist Company-X, based at Wintec House in Hamilton, were working with the Angular 2 web and desktop development platform, originally built by Google, for about half a year before many other developers were using it in major development projects. “At the time we decided to begin using the early, Alpha, version of Angular 2, Google did not even have a release date,” said Company-X analyst developer Justin Taylor. “But we knew it would be fully released to the world in six months or so.” Company-X analyst developers design and build custom software for clients which range from large, multinational, businesses with their head offices overseas, to small, one person, businesses. In the time since the Company-X team began using Angular 2 the software went through many iterations. They became familiar with its alpha release which soon changed to a developer preview of the software. They then used the beta release, release candidate, and are now working with the final version. Any trepidation from the Company-X team around the new Angular 2 technology, a completely reimagined version of the web and desktop development platform that had come before from Google, was quickly dispelled. Justin, and his Company-X colleagues, quickly realised the benefits. Angular 2’s modularity, delivering a lighter and faster core of functionality, makes the platform easier to work on, delivering efficiencies to the client. It’s a far cry from the bad old days, of many years ago, when the norm was what became known as spaghetti code. Spaghetti code is a derogatory term for computer code with complex control structure, conceptually like a twisted and tangled bowl of spaghetti. “We have found that it is more productive because it is less prone to error, and it has got testing and error checking built in,” he said. “It really speeds up development, enabling you to do a lot more in the time and budget allowed.” Desktop development is much easier in Angular 2 when mobile performance issues are handled first. It only works with modern versions of web browsing applications such as Apple Safari, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer, doing away with the need for browser compatibility workarounds. “We are using Angular 2 in the front end, the part of the application directly accessed by the user. For me it’s been the most exciting project that I have been involved in because this is all new and exciting – the latest stuff.” The apps worked on by analyst developers at Company-X, owned by directors David Hallett and Jeremy Hughes, work on either mobile or desktop computing devices. Meaning Company-X developers are writing applications that work on Apple or Google Android mobile devices or desktop computers running Apple’s iOS X operating system or Microsoft’s Windows operating system. David said Company-X was committed to working at the leading edge. “By the time most people have heard of a new technology my Company-X team and I have most likely discovered it, researched it, experienced it, written about it, and replaced it with something new and exciting,” David said.

Are you ready? CNET Jessica Dolcourt 16/01/2017 SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Why Ikea's refugee shelter won design of the year Trump's ban: May 'does not agree' and will intervene if Brits are affected © Provided by CNET Samsung debuted its Youm flexible-display technology at CES' closing keynote today, and the tech is nothing short of eye-popping. The screens, which were shown off here as just a concept, promise to change what kind of form factors are possible for companies that make smartphones and tablets. Read our early report on the display and watch it in action here. She pushed down hard on the rectangular phone and, like a slap bracelet, it cinched around her wrist. The audience gasped; the internet went wild. This articulated wraparound phone -- known as the CPlus -- was a concept device Lenovo used to wow the crowd as part of a larger launch last June that included the modular Moto Z and Phab 2 Pro (the first phone using Google's Tango software for augmented reality). The CPlus may have only been a prototype, but it might as well have been a fireworks show for the imagination it ignited about the future of truly flexible phones that can bend and even fold. As powerful as today's phones are, their rectangular reliability has become a boring necessity that we hardly see at all. And that's why handsets that bend, twist, snap and fold will electrify and energize the industry, even if these newfangled future devices limp and lag at first.  Why would we want a bendable or foldable phone? Flexing, folding handsets are visually and intellectually cool because rigid electronic pieces usually don't bend, at least not without a hinge. But is there an actual use for them beyond pushing the boundaries of what designers and scientists can do? Actually, there are a few. Folding a device gives you a smaller, more portable package to carry around -- it can essentially double the size of your screen. In addition, devices like these "will be able to be produced like newsprint," said Roel Vertegaal, who directs the Human Media Lab at Canada's Queens University and works on prototype models. Producing some phone parts this way could eventually make the phones cheaper to build, he added. Shapely devices that give you more of a shifting 3D work surface (rather than a constantly flat screen) also have the power to change how people carry and even use them, like navigating in new ways while playing a game, or using the way you bend a device to trigger an action, like during gameplay or for creating sound (see video above). Few, far between and potentially flawed Lenovo's pill-bug phone isn't the only one to stretch the boundaries of flexible devices. In fact, twistable phone prototypes are something we were seeing as far back as 2011. Samsung will reportedly release a phone that folds open into a tablet later in 2017, which would take the curved-screen (but static) Edge handsets to the next level, and LG Electronics is rumored to be supplying Apple, Google and Microsoft with flexible phone displays in 2018. Lenovo, too, is working on a tablet prototype that folds down to make a smaller overall package. The company briefly flashed it to journalists at the same time it showed off the wraparound CPlus. But while research on flexible and foldable phones is heating up in corporate and private labs, don't expect to see them everywhere at once. Companies tend to go slowly and cautiously with radical new designs. Take Samsung's first curved-screen phone, for example. The Galaxy Round was essentially a concept phone that never left South Korea, but its design morphed through several iterations to arrive at today's S7 Edge with its two curving sides. Xiaomi's nearly bezel-less Mi Mix is also another concept device whose technology will show up in other handsets down the line. It's likely that the first of these futuristic, flexible phones will: - Cost a lot to make (and be therefore expensive to buy) - Sell in small numbers - Sell in one or two test markets to see how early buyers react There's also wear and tear to consider on phones you repeatedly fold and bend. "[I] don't see why I'd like my phone to bend and in fact, have put it in an OtterBox to protect it from the daily abuse it has to endure," said Chris Schmandt, who directs the Living Mobile Group at MIT's Media Lab. It's possible, too, that a new, more flexible design could affect the kind of hardware you can put into a device, say, a smaller battery than you can stick in a large, flat rectangle. It's also likely that rigid parts, like circuit boards, will have to use a different internal configuration, or be made to slightly bend as well. The drive to get there first So if bendable and flexible phones aren't guaranteed to be a smash hit, why would companies pour cash into R&D for phones that may not go mainstream for years, or even ever? The truth is, we can't always accurately predict which trends will catch on and which will go thud. But there is a certain glory in innovating first, and there's a distinct market advantage for companies that have the most experience if and when flexible and bendable gadgets take off. (Samsung in particular might benefit here if it's first to release its foldable electronics. "Samsung will likely take the 'disruptive' road back to the market," said Wayne Lam, an analyst with IHS Markit, "And hopefully put the Note 7 fiasco behind them.") What excites me most, though, is that this type of innovation helps phone makers everywhere build on past discoveries to propel new ones. It is, after all, only through trial and error that the industry collectively figures out what works and what doesn't. It's the kind of development that will give us the next tech we can't live without, the same way that the passion to miniaturize a desktop computer brought about the smartphone tucked into your pocket right now.

This company has been there for a long time. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Jan 15, 2017 at 6:21PM Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is best-known for its search engine, but is also home to some big moves in artificial intelligence (AI). Nearly a year ago, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stepped in as the guest writer of Alphabet's annual founders' letter and noted:   "... the next big step will be for the very concept of the 'device' to fade away. Over time, the computer itself -- whatever its form factor -- will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world."  Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to recreate our capacity to learn. Image source: Pixabay. Let's take a look at what AI is and how Google is working to be at the forefront of the move to an AI-first world.  Most references to AI actually refer to machine learning, and more specifically, deep learning, a specific discipline within AI. So what is deep learning? It's when a computer simulation of the human brain called a neural network is used to recreate our capacity to learn. It is fed a multitude of examples and complex algorithms that "teach" it to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. In the simplest terms, the computer learns to recognize patterns from massive quantities of data. Machine learning ninjas at Google Google systems are benefiting from deep learning. Image source: Pixabay Engineers proficient in deep learning are currently estimated to be about 10% of the company's 25,000 engineers and a leader of Google's machine learning effort has said he'd like that number to be closer to 100%. To help spread machine learning, the company created the Machine Learning Ninja Program, which identifies talented coders and embeds them in its machine-learning teams. When the six-month program is over, they fan out across the company seeking new ways to apply machine learning to existing systems. This strategy is paying off. For instance, it freed employees from cataloging street addresses captured by Google's Street View cars updating its Maps service: Google Brain now completes the tedious and time-consuming task using image recognition. Google helped solidify its lead in deep learning two years ago when it acquired London-based AI company DeepMind for $600 million. It has since used machine learning technology to arrange its data centers more efficiently, based on how their power use had changed over time. Expanding on that success, Google now uses DeepMind technology to control the power consumption in those data centers. By manipulating servers and cooling systems and controlling over 120 condition-based variables, the company achieved a 15% improvement in power usage efficiency and a 40% reduction in cooling costs. These hundreds of millions of dollars in savings over several years will help recoup the cost to acquire DeepMind and there are plans to roll this strategy out to other potential applications. DeepMind's technology is also available to help companies that run on Google's cloud to improve their own energy efficiency.   Increased functionality for consumers Consumer products are seeing dramatic improvements. Image source: Pixabay. Google Assistant is where Google's AI most directly meets people. It powers the Google Home smart speaker and, in future, will be able to stream music, movies, and TV to the growing ecosystem of Google-branded devices including Android TV, Chromecast, and speakers.  It will also provide deeper personalization resulting from data located in Maps, Calendar, Keep, and other services. In several recent unscientific tests,  Google Assistant was found to be superior to its competitors. One key selling point is the ability to answer follow-up questions.  .   Other examples abound. Users of Google Translate saw a dramatic improvement in its usefulness and accuracy as applying advances in natural-language processing reduced error rates by up to 85%, making greater progress in six weeks than the service had seen in the previous 10 years. Google Photos now has the uncanny ability to locate a specific photo based on a description by the user. Gmail's Inbox introduced a Smart Reply feature that suggests three potential responses to an email that users can choose with a tap, rather than having to type an answer. The Foolish final word   Google has been increasingly focusing its efforts on AI and planning for an AI-centric world.  While it typically does not release the terms of acquisitions, it is telling that Google has acquired 11 AI-related companies in the last five years and applying AI technology to increasing its competitive advantage and positioning for the future. While it will be difficult to quantify some benefits, we already know deep learning can increase revenue and efficiency, and make the ecosystem more productive and valuable to consumers. This moonshot will continue to pay dividends.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Danny Vena owns shares of Alphabet (A shares).

"I'd call it one of the last paradises on Earth." Hide Caption 12 of 12 Story highlights The Mergui Archipelago is located near the southern tip of Myanmar Its 800 islands are becoming an increasingly popular destination for charter yachts (CNN)There are few places on Earth that rival the untamed wilderness and primal seclusion of Myanmar's Mergui Archipelago. Captain Thomas Bruning knows this all too well. Since leaving his job as an engineer, the Austrian native has been sailing the globe for over 20 years. Logging some 500,000 nautical miles, he considers water and wind to be the space where "magic takes place." MORE: 9 of the best new cruise ships launching in 2017 Read More "The Mergui made me realize that although the world is changing so rapidly, there are still places that remain untouched, virgin, unspoiled," he tells CNN. "Sailing around the Mergui feels like you've found something that was lost. I'd call it one of the last paradises on Earth." Since Mergui still lacks any kind of tourism infrastructure -- even basic means of transport -- the group of 800 islands remains widely accessible only to boats, in particular charter yachts. Thus it remains prohibitively difficult to reach by the general public. Mergui visitors get beaches like this all to themselves. You won't find these islands on Google Maps Just a few years ago, few yachts were taking advantage of Mergui as a charter destination. However, as Myanmar government's permit policy opens up, more vessels have since been setting sail, offering private charter itineraries, mostly from Indonesia and Thailand. Nikko Karki, director of Indo Yachts, a charter company in Indonesia organizing trips on several vessels to Mergui, says the trips appeal to those who are looking to "essentially travel back in time" to encounter a lost civilization. "The type of traveler who enjoys Mergui is someone who values being the first one in a region, the adventure of exploration and the idea that every day you have the chance to discover something totally new," he says. "The islands you Google won't show up. No one has written anything about them. The photos you take will be original. If you dive, you'll be exploring a new underwater world. It's unlikely you'll see another boat the entire time you're there." MORE: Asia's most exciting 2017 hotel openings Myanmar's Moken have lived in the islands for hundreds of years. Travelers with a bit of luck on their side may have a chance encounter with the Moken, the semi-nomadic sea gypsies who have eked out an existence on these islands for hundreds of years. Discovering the lost lands by yacht turns out to be a suitable match for would-be explorers looking to leave the Moken's home the way they found it. "Yachts are the ideal means for visiting isolated areas," says Sebastien Gallardo, cruise director of Dunia Baru, an Indonesian ironwood yacht. "The yachts leave no traces of pollution behind and obviously make no changes to the island landscapes. "Yachting," he adds, "is actually one of the most sustainable forms of ecotourism and leaves the areas they visit exactly as nature intended." MORE: 11 things to know before visiting Myanmar Life onboard Dunia Baru: "Like a floating villa." While built following the traditional lines of an Indonesian phinisi, Dunia Baru, for instance, is outfitted with technologies befitting a modern superyacht. "Dunia Baru is like a floating villa," says Karki. "It is spacious and immaculate like a five-star hotel. "The difference is that my 90-year-old grandmother could come on Dunia Baru and visit Mergui in total comfort. She couldn't do that on a smaller boat." Karki, who offers Dunia Baru for private charter through Indo Yachts, has assembled itineraries that include day excursions to pristine beaches and hidden lagoons. Guests seeking further adventure can also cruise through islands on a dinghy. The typical itinerary lasts about seven to 10 days, and the larger yachts that sail the Mergui, such as Dunia Baru, can accommodate up to 14 travelers in seven separate cabins. "My trip to the Mergui enlarged my appreciation for moving out of more commercial, westernized tourist areas elsewhere in Southeast Asia," says Charles Robba, a former passenger of Dunia Baru. "One feels like an explorer on several levels. Viewing new landscapes each day, going on a RIB (rigid-hulled inflatable boat) to explore a beach, or taking a kayak by oneself to quietly drift off provides you with a new perspective to one's sense of the place." MORE: 8 luxury cruise ships that aren't floating hotels Safety issues Safety and security in Myanmar are augmented by the presence of military bases spread throughout the islands and a government-appointed guide onboard each charter. Companies such as US-based Redoint Resolutions provide emergency medical and evacuation services as an additional contingency plan. Mergui tours A Lamima passenger room.

self-censorship As fake news and trolling grow, the EU is pushing Facebook, Twitter and other social networks to comply with hate speech laws 16 January 2017 - 06:30 AM Leonid Bershidsky Making a statement: Social network users are better able to police their own feeds than a network is to censor the huge amount of content it carries. Picture: SUNDAY TIMES The pressure for social networks to censor the content that appears on them just won’t cease, and the networks are bending. Censorship, however, is not what users want. Nor is it technically possible, even if the platforms won’t admit it. The EU is pushing Facebook, Twitter and other social networks to comply with member states’ hate speech laws. In the US, many in the media and on the losing side of the recent presidential campaign would like to see the platforms take action against fake news. Unlike in cases involving abuse of market dominance (the charge Google faces in Europe) or the release of users’ private data (over which Microsoft has fought the US government), the platform owners aren’t fighting back. In May, Facebook, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Microsoft signed a code of conduct in which they promised to review most hate speech reports within 24 hours and remove content that they find illegal. The EU wasn’t content with that; Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova voiced dismay last week that only 40% of reports are reviewed within 24 hours, according to a compliance audit. Her tone was stringent. "If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the nonlegislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months."

Social media companies are taking heat for influencing the outcomes of the U.S. presidential election and Brexit referendum by allowing fake news, ... Science & Technology 1 month ago This is a threat: Unless the social networks step up self-censorship, legislation will be passed to force them to comply. In the US, where free speech is protected by the First Amendment, there’s no such urgency, but plenty willing to offer well-meaning advice. For the most part, demands have to do with having users flag offensive content and then reacting quickly to the complaints. That is a deeply flawed process, as Microsoft’s Kate Crawford and Cornell University’s Tarleton Gillespie explained in a 2014 paper: "Disagreements about what is offensive or acceptable are inevitable when a diverse audience encounters shared cultural objects. From the providers’ point of view, these disagreements may be a nuisance, tacks under the tyres of an otherwise smoothly running vehicle. But they are also vital public negotiations. Controversial examples can become opportunities for substantive public debate: Why is a gay kiss more inappropriate than a straight one? Where is the line drawn between an angry political statement and a call to violence? What are the aesthetic and political judgments brought to bear on an image of a naked body — when is it "artistic" versus "offensive?" People have a social incentive not to share fake stories: They will be mocked by friends if they do Flagging has been gamed ever since it became available to users. Campaigns have been run to flag pro-Muslim content on YouTube as terrorist, pro-Ukrainian content on Facebook as reprehensibly anti-Russian (and vice versa), gay groups as offensive to Christians, and so on. In many cases, the social networks’ abuse teams have removed posts flagged by both sides so as not to alienate anyone. I see many of the bloggers I follow disappear for a few days due to bans imposed in such campaigns, then resurface and keep going until the abuse team is overwhelmed with new flags. Still, regulators and well-wishers want the networks to make flagging easier and more prevalent — and then work as fast as possible with the complaints. The tech firms can only comply by hiring more censors, inventing technological solutions and going to third parties for validation. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said his company plans to use automation to take down offending content before users flag it and to work with outside groups to verify stories. The EU-dictated code of conduct encourages the latter scenario, too. Picture: ISTOCK Yet given the current, primitive state of natural language processing, the automation will do more harm than good. A new gimmick — a shared database of content removed by Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube as terror-related — will only amplify the effect of errors made by each of the networks, and only until the posters start gaming it by making minor changes to their content. As for outsourcing censorship, the partisan biases it brings into the process are too numerous to account for. A report from Morning Consult, a polling and research company, shows that 24% of people in the US believe the reader holds the most responsibility for preventing the spread of fake news; just 17% believe the social networks do. Indeed, social network users are much better able to police their own feed than the network is to censor the staggering amount of content it carries. A reader is usually able to tell fake news from real news; in the Morning Consult survey, 55% of respondents said they had, on more than one occasion, started reading a story only to realise it was untrue. People have a social incentive not to share fake stories: They will be mocked by friends if they do. In many cases, people share fake news knowingly — because it confirms their biases or because they want to troll the subject of the fake story — but in these cases, Facebook and Twitter cannot expect a flag from these users, only from their equally emotional opponents. If a government has passed laws against hate speech, it should be able to enforce them with the large security apparatus at its disposal Similar mechanics are involved in the spread of "hate speech," terrorist recruitment videos and cyberbullying posts. It’s easy for a user to block those who spread this kind of content. Some won’t, however, because they’re not offended by it. Instead of signalling compliance, the networks should stand up and make a few simple points. If a government has passed laws against hate speech, it should be able to enforce them with the large security apparatus at its disposal. It cannot delegate the policing to companies any more than it can outsource, say, the fight against terror. If the governments admit they are unable to police the networks, how can they expect the private firms to be able to do it? In any case, in the Morning Consult survey, only a small minority wanted the government to prevent the spread of fake news. That reflects the average user’s attitude towards any government-enforced censorship, no matter how it is exercised. In a free society, specific people are responsible for their thoughts and actions. Social platforms can provide the tools for getting rid of offensive or irrelevant posts and try to block bots, but they should not exercise some kind of misguided parental authority over their adult users. The social networks may see taking a stand as an unnecessary risk given the legislative threats. Yet they may be better off fighting censorship now, before they’re choked by ever-increasing, unreasonable demands to step it up. Bloomberg Please login or register to comment.

A 747 flight simulator built in a basement. There’s a project page where a few more details are revealed. There’s a 180 degree wrap-around screen for the main display, a glass cockpit, and the controls and gauges are ‘good enough’ to feel like the real thing. The simulator is running a highly customized version of FS9 (Microsoft’s flight sim from the year 2004). For the last few years, Google has been experimenting with high altitude balloons delivering Internet to remote populations. This is Project Loon, and simply by the fact that Google hasn’t shuttered this Alpha-bit, we can assume the project is a success. A Project Loon balloon recently crashed in Panama, which means we can get an up-close look at the hardware. These balloon base stations are a lot bigger than you would think. We’ve seen beautiful PCBs before, but [Blake] is taking this to another level entirely. He’s developed a process to convert bitmaps into files suitable to send to a PCB manufacturer. The results are… strange, and very cool. Check out a video of the process here. If you want to dial out from behind the great firewall of China, you’re probably going to use a VPN. Here’s an idea that doesn’t work as well as a VPN. Use an acoustic coupler with your iPhone. Will it work? Of course it will – modems have been standardized for fifty years. Will it work well? No, I can speak faster than 300 baud. Do you sell on Tindie? We have a dog park.

I learnt something new today – wikipedia agrees with you calling it “Dia de Muertos” (no “los” needed), it is a back-translation to call it “Dia de los Muertos”. Not entirely sure what the difference is (day of dead vs. day of the dead?), anyone know enough Spanish to explain the difference?

Now that it’s available nearly everywhere, here we’ll be sharing four great reasons why owners should use Samsung Pay. Like triple reward and other incentives. Advertisement Released in late 2015 users will need a Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, or a Galaxy S7 to enjoy all it has to offer. Not to mention the latest Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch and a supported bank. Read: Samsung Pay vs Android Pay: What’s The Difference Between Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and now Android Pay, not to mention LG working on its own version, wireless mobile payments are here to stay. For those who’ve yet to try it, here are a few reasons why I use Samsung Pay. Furthermore, why it’s worth recommending to those with a Samsung smartphone. Advertisement Advertisement Samsung Pay was first announced during the Galaxy S6 announcement in early 2015, but wasn’t released until September after a short beta. Apple Pay had a one-year lead on Samsung, but it doesn’t work nearly as well. In addition to only being supported at select retail stores or update payment terminals. In fact, we recently wrote an article on why we don’t use Apple Pay, and stated some good reasons to avoid it. That said, Samsung Pay works almost everywhere and has none of those limitations. As a result it’s absolutely worth using. Here’s a list of supported devices, carriers, banks and credit cards. Update: In late 2015 Samsung added support for Chase and Mastercard, two huge partners that will allow millions to enjoy Samsung Pay. Then in December added gift cards, additional features and improved the user interface. Throughout 2016 Samsung has added loyalty cards and support for over 500 banks or Credit Unions. If you have a device, bank and card that works with Samsung Pay, take advantage of all it has to offer. Advertisement Safe & Secure All Samsung smartphones that work with Samsung Pay feature the latest cutting edge technology in terms of security on a smartphone. From fingerprint scanners to the latest monthly security patches. Between users needing a fingerprint to actually use Samsung Pay to make wireless payments with their phone, and all the security measures in place are why it’s safe to use. Here is Samsung’s thoughts on security: “your purchases remain yours alone. Samsung Pay uses several layers of security. It keeps your payment information separate and doesn’t store or share it, so you can pay without worry.” Samsung Pay doesn’t store or share payment or credit card information, making it safe to use. Not to mention multiple layers of security are in place to keep it safe from hackers trying to steal information. Yes part of the technology behind it was hacked last year, but it didn’t compromise S-Pay in any way. In fact, it’s believed the reason behind it was to try and steal the technology used. That brings us to our next point, why this service is so great. Samsung Pay Works Almost Everywhere Unlike Apple Pay or Android Pay, Samsung’s method works almost everywhere. It’s accepted everywhere that works with Apple Pay, in addition to any payment terminal that accepts a credit card. Samsung claims nearly 95% of all retail stores in the United States will work. So yes, almost everywhere. Advertisement The service uses both NFC and MST (magnetic secure transmission) to make wireless payments. All a user needs to do is tap their phone to the payment terminal, touch the fingerprint scanner for authentication, and you’re all done. This is done with NFC, but it’s also backwards compatible with all swipe-based magnetic payment terminals. Meaning anywhere you can swipe a credit card, you can use Samsung Pay. If NFC (Apple Pay style) isn’t accepted, it uses the magnetic signal. Which is sent when swiping a debit/credit card. It’s fast, easy, and secure. Apple and Google both use NFC, which is Near Field Communications. Meaning that select locations around the US like Starbucks, vending machines, retail stores and others need to have updated payment terminals inside their stores for it to actually work. Devices with the “Paypass” or “Apple Pay Accepted Here” signs you’ve probably seen like the one above are required. As a result many places don’t accept Apple or Android Pay, making it useless for those with an iPhone or recent Android devices. Advertisement This is key. Samsung Pay works at all of those locations, as well as the others. Making it extremely convenient unlike any other mobile payment service on the market. I’ve made payments at stores that don’t accept Apple Pay, like Walmart, and the cashiers constantly tell me, “Hey, that doesn’t work here”. Then are shocked to see it works. The responses I’ve received are everything from confusion, amazement, to curious and full of questions. Rewards New to our list is Samsung Pay Rewards, which debuted on November 14th 2016. This reason alone is enough to suggest owners try it. The goal is to get more people to try the service, and to thank the millions that already have. Samsung Rewards works just like a points-based credit card reward program. Every mobile purchase made will earn points. Users can double-dip by earning points from the card and Samsung, not to mention earn rewards on a debit card. Something that typically doesn’t happen from banks. These points can be redeemed for Samsung products, vouchers, gift cards, visa cards and more. The company also has double or triple bonus programs planned. Imagine getting 4x points, points from the card issuer, then getting a gift card. Impressive, right? The more you use Samsung Pay each month, the higher tier users will be. From Silver, Gold and Platinum for better rewards and more double-ups. Additionally, there will be instant winners for random giveaways simply for earning points and making payments with your wireless device. More information can be found here. Easy to Use And finally, Samsung Pay is extremely simple to use. So much in fact that once it’s setup users don’t even have to turn on their phone to make payments. Which is one of the many reasons I use it daily. Setup takes less than a minute and consists of installing the Samsung Pay app if it isn’t already installed. Then using the camera to capture and save your credit or debit card. Users can also enter the information manually. Once done, you’ll never need to use the Samsung Pay app again. Although there are free gift cards and other incentives in the “announcements” part of the Samsung Pay app. Check it to earn free $25 gift cards, Dunkin’ Donut freebies and more. Slide up on the home or lockscreen to instantly launch Samsung Pay Once done simply swiping up from the bottom of the screen (even while the phone is turned off) will initiate Samsung Pay. Users will be instructed to pay with their fingerprint. Now just hold your phone up near the terminal or NFC reader. It takes less than two seconds, and you’re all done. The transmission is secure, and doesn’t go very far so hackers can’t collect the information. Users can swipe up while the phone is off, or turned on, right from the homescreen or even the lockscreen. There’s a persistent little tab on the bottom (shown above) making it quick and easy. This can be removed if users would like, but then you’ll need to open the app before making payments. Samsung’s phones can tell which signal is required, and there’s no difference in the process or timing whether it’s NFC or MST. It just works, and works well. Users can also swipe through a list of cards if more than one has been added, which is also a swipe and fingerprint tap away. There’s no finding a card in your wallet, digging through a full purse, or hoping the location works with Apple Pay. Just pull out your phone, swipe, tap and pay. Samsung plans to add additional banks, cards and more features in the near future. We’ve seen a lot added in 2016 and expect that trend to continue next year. We’re also hearing they could have some big deals and rewards during Black Friday. Hands down Samsung Pay is the best wireless mobile payment method on the market. It’s fast, secure, safe, and more importantly easy to use everywhere. As a reminder, Samsung Pay doesn’t work at gas pumps or ATMs, but that’s about the only limit users will run into. If you have a capable device and a supported bank or card, give it a try today. You’ll be glad you did. It works amazingly well on my Galaxy S7 Edge. 17 Responses 11/14/2015 John Reply Considering the lead time before Samsung Pay release, you’d think they would have gotten more banks on board. Of the five, two are obscure. Samsung really needs to get on the ball with this before a competitor/phone manufacturer gets MST which makes this app work nearly everywhere – which is also the sole reason why one should get Samsung Pay. Once that benefit is gone and Apple puts it into their next phones, Samsung is buried. 11/24/2015 Peter Reply Samsung has the patent for MST. Also, since Samsung’s older phones already have NFC built-in, they can update the Samsung Pay app to support all legacy Samsung devices with NFC included (work only for NFC). That would be great. 11/15/2015 eric coultas (@glimmerman76) Reply John samsung owns all the mst payment patents. 03/26/2016 Abelardo Reply Please sign my petition for capital one to support Samsung Pay.

Do you give the server your phone? 04/08/2016 Nick V Reply I love Samsung Pay! I accidentally left my card at home one night and had shopping and dinner to do. I explained to the cashiers that I need to pay with my phone as I didn’t have my card. They looked at me all strangely (I do live in Idaho haha!) and said ok … as I’m holding up my phone to their swiper deal, they start saying “Ummm, I don’t think we have that …. OH MY GOD IT WORKED!!” Haha! Three different store cashiers reacted this way … it was awesome! I highly recommend it! 04/08/2016 Lalo Reply Thats the standard reaction at every store I have used it at too. The only store it didnt work at for me was Wal-Mart self check out lanes. The cashier had to suspend the transaction but I was able to pay at a different station that had a different card swiper model. 04/09/2016 Kathryn Reply !!!Super and Easiest 0nl!nee Home opportunity for all. make 87 Dollars per hour and Make 2512 Dollars per month.All you just Need an Internet Connection and aComputer To Make Some Extra cash. Visit this link…… See More 05/24/2016 Chris Pearson Reply Yes SamsungPay works just as advertised on most payment card reader systems out there. The reaction is always fun to watch. I found that even in some stores there are card readers that will not play nicely with the app. I just avoid those lines now. It’s probably about time an update to this article because the list of cards and banks that you can add have more than doubled. 06/21/2016 Finn Reply Does it really work when the phone is switched off? On the S7 Edge it doesn’t appear when the phone is off and it takes 30 seconds to activate when the phone is switched on. 12/22/2016 Unplugged Reply On my S7 Edge, the phone switches on immediately. No 30 seconds. You just swipe up from the bottom of the phone. BTW, the Samsung Watch S3 uses MST, so you don’t even have to get out your phone. 10/16/2016 Joe shmoe Reply I have been using it for the better part of 2 weeks and its works awesome it has cut the amount of cards I carry in my wallet by half.I have only had 2 places that it didn’t work gas station swipe and at a very old retailer using the swipe on a cash-register. So much quicker then having to pull the card out of my wallet. 11/18/2016 Max Reply i read some news said MST need to save your signature for reference when you use it? it work when the phone should switched on ? if i choose to use NFC to make the payment i think i want to be faster, if i still need to use POS to connect phone and check the signature, can i be faster ? it is not all the samsung phone can use MST just like Galaxy S6 Edge ? anyone know ? 11/28/2016 cara Reply One MAJOR issue with Samsung pay is it’s propensity to double charge your card. Twice now, Ive had a double charge occur when using Samsung Pay. It hasn’t happened at merchants like Panera who are set up to accept Samsung Pay or tap but, at merchants who have magnetic strip readers. For now, I will not be using the service. I’ll wait until they work out the bugs. If I didn’t check my account regularly I would never had known! 12/04/2016 Joseph Reply http://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/compatible-cards/#bank The above website lists the hundreds of banks which are on-board. 12/18/2016 Joe T. Reply One thing I didn’t see mentioned in the article was Samsung Pay’s support for reward cards. I just ask the cashier at the food store if I can aim the phone at their scanner and it takes. Even my library card works. Samsung pay has emptied my wallet of all these miscellaneous cards. 01/15/2017 Nate Admiraal Reply I would get another Samsung phone purely due to the ease and convenience of Samsung pay. It’s the greatest thing since sliced bread — a bit off topic, but the only thing that gives me pause is the loss of the IR blaster — which was SO useful for TV/AC/garage door opener, etc. etc. Why oh why did Sammy ditch that feature?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 16 January 2017 Sci-fi tech set for 2017 by tan kit hoong Not just sci-fi anymore: Microsoft's HoloLens promises a future where we can interact with virtual objects in the real world. — Microsoft Technology that lets you merge the digital world with the real one is just one of many that could become a reality this year. IT is really interesting times we live in – not only have we seen the advent of a tiny pocketable computer (i.e. your smartphone) that puts room-filling supercomputers from the 1960s to shame, but we’ve also moved from 32in CRT (cathode ray tube) televisions to gigantic LCD and OLED models that are so thin you can hang them on a wall. And there’s no sign of a slowdown – this year we are expected to embrace even more technologies that until now have only been seen in sci-fi stories and movies. Here are a few emerging tech trends that we’re excited about this year. Augmented reality We saw a lot of VR (virtual reality) products in 2016, from the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive to the Sony PlayStation VR, but what got us most excited for 2017 is augmented reality (AR). In case you don’t know the difference, VR brings you into a virtual 3D computer-generated world while AR reality brings the computer-generated world into real life. If you want to catch a glimpse into how AR can change your world, check out the anime series Denno Coil, where everyone is plugged into a pair of AR glasses which overlays the virtual world on top of the real one. In this world, you can bring up a computer console in front of your eyes at any time and get a virtual pet which can be projected into your view of the real world. Microsoft's HoloLens is just one of many AR devices that promises to bring the computer-generated world into real life. — Microsoft That future is not that far off now that Microsoft has announced Hololens – though still firmly a first-generation product, it even allows you to manipulate virtual objects with your hands. We've already seen a few AR products on the market – you can play a few simple AR games on the Nintendo 3DS handheld gaming device and for smartphones there’s Pokemon Go. Also, Lenovo has released the Phab 2 Pro which is the first smartphone to integrate Google's Tango AR platform. But AR is more than that – imagine wearing a pair of AR glasses which can overlay repair instructions over your real-world motorcycle or being able to pull up information and history of a painting at an art gallery. Some of the more advanced features might still be in the realm of sci-fi, but we think consumers will start to see a lot of interesting things happening this year. Pay with your phone While many of your credit and debit cards already have contactless payment technology built-in for a while now, there’s really something much cooler about using your smartwatches and smartphones to pay for stuff. Essentially, all the technologies – secure NFC chip, fingerprint scanner and secure online payment system – used for contactless payments is already in place in many smartphones. Samsung Pay allows for secure contactless payments using a Samsung smartphone and smartwatches. — Samsung In fact, Samsung Pay – which will allow you to pay using the company’s latest smartwatches and smartphones – is expected to be officially announced soon. Samsung is currently performing an open beta test for selected Maybank Visa cardholders, with more banks such as CIMB Mastercard, Citibank Mastercard & Visa, Standard Chartered Mastercard & Visa to be made available soon. There is no word yet when Apple Pay will make it here. Smart homes You probably have seen this in a video – someone walks into a room and the lights turn on automatically and just about every device, including the sound system, can be commanded by your voice. Yes, we have been waiting for smart homes for a long time now. While the components for creating a smart home have been around for a few years, a unifying standard for connecting all the ­various parts together have not been set. But more and more companies are starting to support multiple standards which could finally pave the way to smart homes this year. Intelligent lighting systems like the Philips Hue is one component in creating a smart home.— Philips Samsung, for instance, has announced SmartThings which supports intelligent devices from many makers while Google has announced its voice-activated Home speaker for controlling other devices. Also, Philips Hue, the smart wireless LED lighting system, is expected to make it to our shores this year. Rise of Blockchain Blockchain could potentially ­revolutionise the entire banking industry by making money ­transfers, stock trading and ­transactions faster and safer. Today, when two parties make a deal, cash and assets take time to get transferred to the respective parties because the related records are located in different institutions and many different parties have to be involved in reconciling this information. This is where Blockchain comes in – originally the basis of the digital currency Bitcoin, Blockchain is essentially an online ledger that logs every transaction and is protected by cryptographic signatures. While originally used as the basis of Bitcoin, Blockchain technology can also be repurposed for use in the financial sector. — 123rf.com Instead of having a central ­server which stores this ledger, the Blockchain is distributed across the entire network of users. So when a transaction is made, it’s recorded into the ledger and automatically updated on all copies across the network, thereby ­eliminating the usual wait time. You’d think this technology is firmly in the realm of sci-fi, but we’re much closer to Blockchain adoption than you think, with many local financial institutions, including Bank Negara, already in talks about how to adopt this ­technology. Autonomous vehicles We honestly never thought we’d be able to see a self-driving car in our lifetime, but lo and behold, autonomous driving vehicles are on the fast track to reality, with big strides being made in the last few years by Tesla, Google and most major automotive companies. With our neighbour Singapore already testing autonomous ­vehicles, this could be the year when self-driving cars make it to our roads. However, with our constantly-changing roads, perhaps this might still be a pipe dream in 2017.

Hide Caption 12 of 12 Story highlights The Mergui Archipelago is located near the southern tip of Myanmar Its 800 islands are becoming an increasingly popular destination for charter yachts (CNN)There are few places on Earth that rival the untamed wilderness and primal seclusion of Myanmar's Mergui Archipelago. Captain Thomas Bruning knows this all too well. Since leaving his job as an engineer, the Austrian native has been sailing the globe for over 20 years. Logging some 500,000 nautical miles, he considers water and wind to be the space where "magic takes place." MORE: 9 of the best new cruise ships launching in 2017 Read More "The Mergui made me realize that although the world is changing so rapidly, there are still places that remain untouched, virgin, unspoiled," he tells CNN. "Sailing around the Mergui feels like you've found something that was lost. I'd call it one of the last paradises on Earth." Since Mergui still lacks any kind of tourism infrastructure -- even basic means of transport -- the group of 800 islands remains widely accessible only to boats, in particular charter yachts. Thus it remains prohibitively difficult to reach by the general public. Mergui visitors get beaches like this all to themselves. You won't find these islands on Google Maps Just a few years ago, few yachts were taking advantage of Mergui as a charter destination. However, as Myanmar government's permit policy opens up, more vessels have since been setting sail, offering private charter itineraries, mostly from Indonesia and Thailand. Nikko Karki, director of Indo Yachts, a charter company in Indonesia organizing trips on several vessels to Mergui, says the trips appeal to those who are looking to "essentially travel back in time" to encounter a lost civilization. "The type of traveler who enjoys Mergui is someone who values being the first one in a region, the adventure of exploration and the idea that every day you have the chance to discover something totally new," he says. "The islands you Google won't show up. No one has written anything about them. The photos you take will be original. If you dive, you'll be exploring a new underwater world. It's unlikely you'll see another boat the entire time you're there." MORE: Asia's most exciting 2017 hotel openings Myanmar's Moken have lived in the islands for hundreds of years. Travelers with a bit of luck on their side may have a chance encounter with the Moken, the semi-nomadic sea gypsies who have eked out an existence on these islands for hundreds of years. Discovering the lost lands by yacht turns out to be a suitable match for would-be explorers looking to leave the Moken's home the way they found it. "Yachts are the ideal means for visiting isolated areas," says Sebastien Gallardo, cruise director of Dunia Baru, an Indonesian ironwood yacht. "The yachts leave no traces of pollution behind and obviously make no changes to the island landscapes. "Yachting," he adds, "is actually one of the most sustainable forms of ecotourism and leaves the areas they visit exactly as nature intended."

While built following the traditional lines of an Indonesian phinisi, Dunia Baru, for instance, is outfitted with technologies befitting a modern superyacht. "Dunia Baru is like a floating villa," says Karki. "It is spacious and immaculate like a five-star hotel. "The difference is that my 90-year-old grandmother could come on Dunia Baru and visit Mergui in total comfort. She couldn't do that on a smaller boat." Karki, who offers Dunia Baru for private charter through Indo Yachts, has assembled itineraries that include day excursions to pristine beaches and hidden lagoons. Guests seeking further adventure can also cruise through islands on a dinghy. The typical itinerary lasts about seven to 10 days, and the larger yachts that sail the Mergui, such as Dunia Baru, can accommodate up to 14 travelers in seven separate cabins. "My trip to the Mergui enlarged my appreciation for moving out of more commercial, westernized tourist areas elsewhere in Southeast Asia," says Charles Robba, a former passenger of Dunia Baru. "One feels like an explorer on several levels. Viewing new landscapes each day, going on a RIB (rigid-hulled inflatable boat) to explore a beach, or taking a kayak by oneself to quietly drift off provides you with a new perspective to one's sense of the place."

Soon, the rest of the strangers eating together receive their meals and devour their food while getting to know each other. This scenario is what College senior Sarah Litwin had in mind when she began an intiative to bring people together over Philadelphia food. Last Wednesday, Litwin sent out a Google form to different student groups such as PennQuest and Bloomers, inviting four or five students to a meal at a Philadelphia restaurant. The form lists more than 10 restaurants, including L’Angolo Ristorante and Talula’s Garden, that Litwin wants to visit during her last semester at Penn. “A lot of people on Penn’s campus tend to stay inside the bubble and so I’m hoping that this initiative will help people expand their reach and try new places with new people,” Litwin said. Litwin has always enjoyed experiencing the atmosphere and food of restaurants with friends, as College seniors Rebecca Schwartz and Natalie Weiss can attest. “I was abroad at the same time as her, and we met in Barcelona and went to this breakfast place, and she asked the waiter for three entrees,” Schwartz said. “The waiter proceeds to show her how big the plates are and she still orders the three entrees.” RELATED: Dim Sum House opens on Chestnut Cafe in Penn Bookstore and Capogiro briefly close after being cited for health violations “She’ll make seven Restaurant Week reservations of various sizes and randomly starts inviting people and seeing if they’re interested,” Weiss added. Litwin hopes to share her passion of exploring restaurants with more people through her initiative. “I don’t see a ton of opportunities for students that have a common desire to eat together off campus.” Litwin said. “People are present when you’re eating ... It’s a really communal experience, and I grew up with family dinners being an important part of my life.” Although anyone can participate in the initiative, Litwin states that upperclassmen and adventurous people stand to benefit the most from dining with her. “I think it would make most sense for... adventurous people, people who either went abroad or want to go abroad, enjoy traveling, seeing things,” Litwin said. “Sometimes it’s the journey too. Sometimes I like to run to restaurants, walk back, work off the food I just ate.” Litwin’s penchant for organizing restaurant trips led to some unusual experiences while eating out. “We were walking back from dinner and we were pranked by a zombie on the street,” Weiss said. “The prank zombie was scaring people on the street and filming their reactions. The video has over six million views.” While people who decide to dine with Litwin may not encounter a prank zombie, they will surely walk away with an adventure unlike anything they’ve ever experienced in a restaurant. “She’s incredibly friendly with the waiters,” Schwartz said. “She actually has a note on her phone. But at Copa, for example, every waiter she’s ever had she’s written down so she can go in and say ‘Bob, it’s Sarah! Remember me?’” After all, friendliness is essential to bringing people together. And in Sarah Litwin’s mind, so is food. All comments eligible for publication in The Daily Pennsylvanian.

In an interview with EurActiv Germany, MEP Julia Reda warned this would threaten the freedom of online news publications and benefit false news outlets at the expense of journalists and small publishers. Julia Reda is a German Pirate Party MEP. She joined the Greens/EFA group and was elected deputy group leader. Reda is a member of the Parliament’s legal affairs committee and a substitute member of the internal market and consumer protection committee. In 2014, she was appointed rapporteur on the EU’s copyright reform. She spoke to EurActiv.de’s Nicole Sagener. Is our freedom to share news on the Internet under threat from the EU’s copyright reform? Yes, Günther Oettinger’s proposal definitely threatens our freedom. Today, news articles are already protected by copyright. But if you take out just a small quote or heading, it is no longer considered an intellectual product and is not protected. Unfortunately, the planned European copyright reform for news publications does not limit protection to creative works. Often URLs or hyperlinks to texts contain the words of the title. If, in future, the use of a URL could be considered a breach of copyright law, the use of links would be affected. This will especially be the case when the headline and summary appear automatically under a link, like on Facebook or Twitter, although the news publishers cooperate actively with the social networks because they want to display the content behind the link. Cultural industries unite against copyright reform France’s cultural industries have shown their determination to fight European copyright reform plans. A parallel movement among members of the European Parliament hopes to have the Electronic Commerce Directive re-examined as part of the reform package. EurActiv France reports.  EurActiv.com Would authors and creators really be rewarded under the new system or would the benefits go mainly to big publishers? Journalists have absolutely nothing to gain from the extension of copyright law to press publishers, we have already seen this in Germany. Similarly, small publishers attract many viewers and readers through social media; their readers come through Facebook, Twitter, Google etc. If users of social networks are only able to link to European news if they have first bought a licence, we will see a massive increase in content from sites not bound by this copyright law. And what risks does this pose? Fake news sites and state-sponsored publishers like Russia Today always try to maximise their readership. So they would never use this copyright law. But the EU’s big newspapers would. As a result, the copyright reform would support fake news websites. Because before linking to any quality publication, you would always have to check whether they apply the new copyright law for publishers. That is a laborious process. Oettinger has been accused of only taking the views of the publishing lobbies into account. Is this true? Interestingly, not all publishers are convinced by the copyright reform; the big cheerleaders are Axel Springer and Burda. These are the two companies that pushed through the German copyright law and strengthened calls to act on the issue at the European level. And they are in close contact with Günther Oettinger through the Association of German Newspaper Publishers (BDZV). Oettinger grilled by MEPs on budget, dodges questions on lobbyist meeting Günther Oettinger dodged an evening of tough questions yesterday (9 January) about a string of his recent slip-ups when three European Parliament committees sounded out the gaffe-prone Commissioner for his new job as EU budget and human resources chief. EurActiv.com I can understand why these big publishers would want to support the copyright law, because they are less dependent on links from social media. Springer and co. have strong brand recognition and would suffer less if it became more difficult to circulate their articles through social media. But copyright law is always promoted by these companies as a step towards greater pluralism, when in fact the opposite is true. We have already seen this in Spain. 10 everyday things on the web the @EU_Commission wants to make illegal: The @GOettingerEU legacy https://t.co/SrCRCSsPNy #33c3 #copyright pic.twitter.com/VeMmfNkhid — Julia Reda (@Senficon) December 28, 2016 Therese Comodini Cachia, the EPP group’s spokeswoman, said at the EPP hearing on the subject this Wednesday (11 January) that the regulation of copyright was an extremely complex matter. Which part of it causes you the biggest headache? As I see it, the copyright law for news publishers is purely negative. The fact that survival is becoming harder for the press is not something that can be solved by copyright law. It has more to do with a shift in the advertising market. The analogue era is over; today, adverts can be targeted much more precisely online. Other aspects of the Commission proposal have both positive and negative sides. For example the regulation on education and innovation. The Commission’s proposal includes a binding exception for the use of copyrighted material in education but only for digital content, such as lectures streamed over the internet. We should make it impossible for member states to give priority to publishers’ licencing in these cases. A school or a teacher should not have to start by checking a publisher’s commercial offering. The free press in Europe is under great pressure. What could really help? We should not aim to support journalists through copyright. I think that what today’s users want is a tailor-made offering, like that provided by Blendle, where they pay a few cents per article. But to make these offerings profitable, the VAT on online journalism must be cut to the same level as print journalism. Germany subsidises the print media but the quality of the content has nothing to do with whether it is printed or online. How can better whistleblower protection support journalists? Editorial publications are under enormous financial pressure. They always have to be wary of getting sued. This makes the publication of original documents and dealings with whistleblowers more difficult. But this protection of investigative journalism is not just a question of press freedom; it also has an important financial aspect. If a publisher has to fund a huge legal department, this makes its financial situation more precarious and threatens its very existence. French lawmakers protect whistleblowers, urge EU to follow suit French MPs on Tuesday (8 November) voted to strengthen legal protection for whistleblowers, as MEPs pushed the Commission to take action at European level. EurActiv France reports. EurActiv.com In Thursday’s (12 January) debate in the legal affairs committee, the article on the duty of internet providers to filter our uploaded content was also a major point of discussion. That would be a sharp break with the judgement of the Court of Justice. This clearly says you cannot force providers to filter all of their users’ uploads. So the article would contravene the right to freedom of opinion and data protection, and infringe on the economic freedom of internet providers. The social democrats have also been highly critical of this. It is interesting that big differences of opinion exist within the political factions. Quite a number of ALDE members like Alexander Graf Lambsdorff are members of the Save the Link initiative, despite the fact that the group’s shadow rapporteur supports the extension of copyright reform to press publishers and the content filtering obligation. That is a contradiction that must be solved.

And now, they all have to register with the government. Tech Industry by Daniel Van Boom January 15, 2017 8:39 PM PST @dvanboom Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Enlarge Image Getty Images China is the world's biggest tech market and may also be the most regulated. The country will be tightening its grip on industry from Monday, when app stores will be required to officially register with the government. Around 75 percent of the 550 million smartphones used in China run Android, but the Google Play Store is banned in the country. There are many companies, like Baidu and Tencent, that have built app stores to fill that gap. Now, they'll all be officially regulated, the Cyberspace Administration of China said Friday. The Cyberspace Administration's notice asserted that app stores aren't managed properly and that this new measure will both make the stores safer and more profitable. The Chinese government, which works hard to control all aspects of the tech and internet worlds inside its borders, has always had a hand in how app stores are managed in the country. Apple earlier this month was made to pull the New York Times app from its store and last year had to shutter its iTunes Movies and iBooks services. This follows new regulations for app developers announced in July, when the Cyberspace Administration told app developers they had to keep a record of user activity for 60 days, establish the identity of users with real-name registration, monitor and report banned content, and seek user consent before collecting personal information and location data.

Not only did the G5 have poor sales, their budget range is no match for its Chinese rivals. Even the Nexus branding was axed by Google this year, something with which LG did well in the past years. Last month it launched the V20 smartphone for the Indian market, which was quite a late decision considering the smartphone was announced globally in September. A desperate move to bring a new flagship, perhaps. I took the smartphone for a spin to see if flagship attempt number two by LG is worth the money. Build and Design: 7.5 / 10 The smartphone is all metal on the back with sloping edges on the top and bottom. The front is mostly glass. You don’t see a lot of smartphones that have a back panel these days, but for those who like a nostalgic touch, the V20 does have one. There is a button on the right edge which pop opens the metal back panel revealing the removable battery, SIM card slots and the microSD card slot. The back is curved close to the edges and you can see the camera module bulging out from the main body. Right below that is a round fingerprint scanner which is also a hardware button and acts as the power key. Around the edges you can see the volume buttons on the left edge, the infrared sensor on the top, the back panel ejector button on the right and on the bottom are the ports (3.5mm audio and USB Type-C) and the loudspeaker grille. The build quality is solid and LG even says that if you accidently drop it, chances of it breaking are low as the back panel and the battery dislodge upon impact. I was very tempted to try it out. But to be honest, the design is a bit simple. I am not saying it’s a bad looking phone, but I think there are better looking options in the market. The V20 has similar dimensions as the Nexus 6P. Features: 7 / 10 The LG V20 comes with top of the line features making it sit with all the flagships of 2016. It features a 5.7-inch display with a QHD (2560×1440 pixel) resolution and sitting right above is a secondary 2.1-inch touch bar offering a 1040×60 pixels resolution. Inside there is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core chipset, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The storage can be expanded further using a microSD card of up to 256GB. It features a dual camera setup with 16MP and 8MP sensors with laser autofocus, OIS and a dual LED flash. The front camera offers a 5MP resolution. Apart from features like infrared sensor and a fingerprint scanner the V20 features a dedicated audio quad-DAC (Digital to Analog Converter). Connectivity options include dual-SIM support (dedicated slots), 4G with VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi, GPS/A-GPS, USB Type-C port and FM Radio. The handset comes with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box with LG’s UX 5.0 skin on top and rounding it all up is a 3,200 mAh battery.

The annual income from “the 10% vig,” oops, tax — estimated to be close to $1 trillion by the end of President Barack Obama’s second term — would nearly wipe out the current budget deficit. State and local casino and lottery operations would not affected by the new national legislation. Code named “You Bet Your Ass,” the concept was conceived in a late night drinking and strategy session in May when it seemed obvious to the president’s senior advisors that a second dip of the economy was all but inevitable. As the fifth fifth of Talisker scotch — the current beverage of choice in Washington — was passed around the table, the always mild-mannered chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, slurred the battle cry of the forthcoming campaign: “I’ll give you 10:1 odds that we kick the shit out of those MF’s in 2012.” At that moment, Moshe Peddler, the senior partner of Peddler and Marconi Communications and the president’s outside media maven, felt he had been hit by a thunderbolt. Nevertheless, it took him all night to put the pieces together: that “10:1 odds” phrase, combined with a lifetime of peddling crap, meant federal control and the “taxing” of online gambling. A quick Google search revealed that it was already legal in some major European countries. Internet gambling was coming. The only question was who would control it: the casino operators or Uncle Sam? Today, the Democrats had control of Congress and maybe they could ram it through. After the elections, who knew? Using $200,000 of his company’s political slush funds, Peddler went right to work: grassroots call-ins the next morning to 2,500 radio stations, followed up by in-depth research. That evening, 3,547 land line and cell phone surveys were conducted on two key issues: First, 73% wanted internet gambling; and, second, the public didn’t give a damn who controlled it, as long as they got to play an honest game of Texas Hold? Em. The next morning, Moshe, Rahm and the President sat down for a super secret meeting. Everyone else was banished. Even the secret recording system was shut down. In five minutes, Moshe presented his plan, his research, the preliminary numbers from the budget office and his findings. The chief of staff was so happy he danced on nine fingers. Maybe he would stay the full term after all. The president was another story. Obviously, he’d piss off the religious right and the casino owners. But they were leaning GOP anyway. If Peddler’s numbers were right, he’d come close to wiping out the budget deficit. He figured that plus health care might make him the fifth face on Mt. Rushmore. Peddler read his boss’ face. He was the best closer on the planet, and went in for the kill like Tyson in his prime. “Mr. President, did you know that England and France have already legalized Internet gambling? Denmark has finished its legislation and Germany, Switzerland and Spain are goose-stepping to be next in line. We either try to regulate and tax it, or people are going to go to the offshore operators, where you don’t get any revenue.” The president was sold. “Rahm,” said the now beaming Obama, “alert all the cable and networks for a major address for Sunday at nine. And make sure those budget numbers are right. “Finally, we need a slogan. Something like: Game On.” Bill Regardie was the founder and publisher of Regardie’s Magazine.

Crunch Network The year in analytics Posted Jan 15, 2017 by Sameer Al-Sakran (@sameer_alsakran) 0 SHARES Next Story Start thinking like a startup Sameer Al-Sakran Crunch Network Contributor Sameer Al-Sakran is the founder and CEO of Metabase, an open source business intelligence company. More posts by this contributor: The 2015 Analytics Software Market How to join the network Well, 2016 is officially in the past. Between the election drama, the stock markets tossing and turning, celebrities moving on and Harambe, it was a doozy. The SaaS correction First things first. It’s hard to make sense of the overall state of the analytics ecosystem without taking into account the SaaS multiples meltdown in February. Most sophisticated observers have come to grips with the fact that a SaaS company in hyper-growth mode chews up every available dollar and then some. However, unless one has access to very fine-grained customer acquisition costs, churn and cohort activity data, it’s fiendishly difficult to tell the difference between a healthy hyper-growth SaaS company and one that is overpaying for low-quality growth. Data of that fine granularity is something that your friendly neighborhood SaaS CFO is unlikely to include in their 10-Qs. This, combined with the sheer amount of cash being burned, makes investors very twitchy when it looks like growth is slowing. LinkedIn had such an unfortunate moment in 2016, and managed to ruin a lot of other companies’ nights in early February. Tableau, Qlik, Salesforce and many others got hit especially hard. The state of data warehouses We’ll start with how the data warehousing world shook out in 2016. Data warehouses are the place where data is stored; they power analytical use. Unless you use an all-in-one cloud BI provider (e.g. Domo, GoodData, etc.), a data warehouse is a central component of any analytics infrastructure. In 2016, the main trends we noted in 2015 — SQL-on-Hadoop displacing traditional analytics databases and the consolidation of data warehouses into cloud-hosting-provider offerings — continued. SQL-on-Hadoop From its earliest days, Hadoop has been largely used for business intelligence and analytics use cases, even when it wasn’t the best choice for it. In 2016, the various SQL-on-Hadoop options started to crowd out other analytics data warehouses. The major projects (Hive, Impala, Presto and Spark) all had major versions that dramatically improved performance and stability. Hive, the original SQL-on-Hadoop player, shipped a key upgrade in March that will probably keep it lingering in people’s stacks for a few more years. Known primarily as a stable, legacy option, its new LLAP upgrade (don’t worry about what the acronym means) allows short-running queries to come back in “interactive” time. Previously, it was difficult to run any query, no matter how small, in less than five seconds. Impala (2.6 in July) and Spark (2.0 in July) both had major performance improvements in large queries. Presto has had a steady drumbeat of improvements, culminating in the announcement of AWS’s Athena, which is a managed Presto on top of its S3 offering, on November 30th. No one got fired for using their cloud provider’s managed data warehouse. With all this momentum and maturity, it will be increasingly difficult for the likes of Teradata, Vertica or Aster to win any new accounts. Much like the emergence of Linux, Apache or WordPress closed out the operating system, web server and blogging software categories, respectively, a robust open source winner in a category can both close out the category to new proprietary entrants and doom competitors to a slow decline. While a single winner hasn’t emerged in this, the trend feels pretty firmly set, and the overall “SQL-on-Hadoop” feels more and more like the new default for large-scale analytics data warehouses. Cloud provider managed data warehouses With Azure announcing the general availability of their SQL Server–based data warehouse in July, all three of the major cloud-hosting players (Amazon, Google and Microsoft) have a viable fully managed data warehouse offering. While opinions differ on the relative merits of each, it’s going to be increasingly common to make a decision as to which database technology to use based on what can be turned on with a couple of clicks on your existing hosting provider. 2016 may well be the year that a new truism takes hold: “No one got fired for using their cloud provider’s managed data warehouse.” In other news, Microsoft’s increasingly softening position against the open source world has led to the previously unthinkable — SQL Server now runs on Linux! Announced in March to some fanfare, and generally available in November, this marks a tremendous shift away from Microsoft’s usual Windows Server-centricity — and hopefully is a sign of further openness. Business intelligence applications The biggest news in the realm of business intelligence applications, or the applications that people use to pull data from the aforementioned data warehouse, has largely centered around the big three cloud-hosting providers. Microsoft products stereotypically need three releases before fully coming into their own. In 2016, Power BI went from being an interesting placeholder product release to being quite functional. It feels well into its 2.0 stage, and, given its history, will be picking up significant steam (and customers). Once major companies have wired you into their processes, they’re not inclined to do much fiddling. The elephant in the room just decided to wake up and start stretching its legs. QuickSight, Amazon’s BI offering, went GA in November of 2016. If you were a company depending on being the “default” interface to Redshift, you’re probably starting to lose sleep. Ecological niches have a habit of being filled, and time will tell if Amazon is able to make a winning end-user-facing application. So far all of the big AWS successes have focused on infrastructure and not end-user interfaces. However, the growing dominance of Redshift as the default data warehouse for anyone on AWS, coupled with AWS’s growth rate, make QuickSight well worth watching. There is a lot of spending adjacent to the data warehouse, and Amazon is making a concerted grab for it. Not wanting to be left out, Google announced a reporting and dashboarding tool called Data Studio in May. Qlik went private If you’re in the U.S./Silicon Valley, Qlik is the biggest BI company you keep forgetting about. Well, Thoma Bravo remembered and took them private in June. In what is becoming the worst kept secret in Silicon Valley, it turns out SaaS companies are great buyout candidates. If you take a SaaS company with solid product and adoption, whose growth has stuttered, get rid of everything aside from a skeleton crew of engineering, customer support and accounting, cash flows can look very, very tempting. While it’s risky to do this too early in a company’s product life cycle, once major companies have wired you into their processes, they’re not inclined to do much fiddling. All the margin of “software” with none of the cash trough of SaaS growth. What’s not to love? Salesforce Wave One of the interesting possibilities exposed when Salesforce launched Wave was that it would move the company toward making significant revenue from the BI category. That seems to not have worked. Instead, Salesforce seems to be betting on verticalizing instead, with the launches of Analytics for Community Cloud in March (e.g. embedding analytics results in other applications), dedicated marketing analytics and financial services in September and generally declaring it to be a platform for others to build analytics applications on top of in June. This mostly puts to rest the possibility of Salesforce becoming a major player in the BI space directly, and seems more a way to add reporting capabilities to Force applications.   Tableau Tableau released a new version this year, with more connectors, data clustering capabilities, better mobile usage, cross database joins and a redesign. However, growth slowed and losses increased compared to the last few years. This, combined with the LinkedIn announcement, lead to Tableau’s stock price dropping by half in the February SaaS apocalypse, and it still hasn’t recovered. Bad times all around. Periscope raised big Joining Looker in the “is it or isn’t it reaching escape velocity?” club, Periscope raised a big honking $25 million Series B from Bessemer in November. It’s fitting in nicely of being a bring your own data warehouse (read: Redshift) plus a managed caching layer. That said, with the announcement of QuickSight, they and many other startups that rode the “frontend to Redshift” wave are in a tricky position. They are now directly competing with AWS’s offerings, rudimentary though they might be. Most of the pack of such applications have quickly added BigQuery support this year, and are hoping to diversify their customer base. Data collection Piping your interaction data into Redshift and using a BI application instead of Mixpanel and friends is starting to move from the bleeding edge to commonly accepted wisdom. In the shadow of Amazon’s almost-but-not-quite-there offering (Mobile Analytics + Data Pipelines) to get interaction data into Redshift, there has been a bit of consolidation in the “piping data into Redshift” segment of the market. On many levels, the existence of these companies is really more of an indictment of how clunky and cumbersome AWS’s data movement options are. The play unfolding is a consequence of the growth of cloud computing providers taking over the lion’s share of new hosting. There has been a bit of a shakeout with a number of startups going quiet. A first set of winners seem to be shaking out. Segment continues to own the developer mindshare regarding the current Segment+Redshift+BI Application stack. Panoply raised a Series A in August from Intel Capital, and Alooma raised from Sequoia in 2014 and is still going strong. RJMetrics, an early all-inclusive cloud analytics provider, sold off its Cloud BI product to Magento in August and formed a new company, Stitch, around their data pipelines product. The big picture The play unfolding is a consequence of the growth of cloud computing providers taking over the lion’s share of new hosting. When all your infrastructure is on AWS, Azure or Google Compute, it takes a very strong reason to not use your provider’s fully managed data warehouse solution. The writing is also on the wall that the same cloud providers will be providing the front end to this data. Add some analyst and data infrastructure spending and you get a fully unified data warehouse in the sky for a fraction of what it cost Google, Facebook or Netflix 10 years ago. Most vertical analytics providers are going to need to start having strong answers to “why can’t I just run everything you provide as a SQL query on top of my company’s data on Redshift?” The gold rush in two-person SaaS vertical analytics companies is going to start looking more and more grim.      Featured Image: ANDRZEJ WOJCICKI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase HIVE Overview HIVE is a collaboration tool designed for small teams by a small team.

But six years after ‘Silicon Roundabout’ was launched, it is starting to lose its allure. Official figures show a dramatic slowdown in the number of new businesses starting up in Tech City – the area of East London which includes Old Street. The number of new openings fell by 70 percent, from 10,280 in 2015 to 3,070 last year, figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showed. And they have fallen even more sharply since 2014, when 15,620 new businesses opened. According to experts, rents in the area have become so expensive, fledgling businesses are now forced to look elsewhere. Colin Jones, partner at the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young, which obtained the figures from HMRC, said: ‘Silicon Roundabout has fallen off the top spot in terms of new business creation, it is a victim of its own success. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Inside - and outside - the £6m penthouses off London's... Britain's booming tech industry beats Silicon Valley: London... Share this article Share ‘The Silicon Roundabout area gained popularity with internet companies originally due to its historically low rents. Now that rents have soared, the area has lost its competitive advantage.’ The slump in new start-ups has knocked TechCity off its perch as one of the most attractive places in the UK for entrepreneurs to set up. It was the UK’s fastest growing area for new businesses in 2013 and 2014, but dropped six places last year, so that it is now behind Warrington and London’s Leicester Square. The revelation will be an embarrassing blow for the Government, which tried to turn TechCity into a hub for new start-ups and entrepreneurs. The Government launched the scheme in late 2010, in a bid to turn the East London district into one of the ‘world’s great technology centres’. Official figures show a dramatic slowdown in the number of new businesses starting up in Tech City – the area of East London which includes Old Street (pictured, Old Street roundabout) Former Prime Minister David Cameron was frustrated by claims that Britain did not have the conditions needed to produce companies like Google or Facebook. But it is not just entrepreneurs who are now opting to put their roots down elsewhere. Meanwhile, many of the major technology businesses that Mr Cameron wanted to emulate have decided to shun the TechCity district. Google is building its London headquarters near Kings Cross, and Facebook is setting up in Fitzrovia – the area just north of London’s Oxford Street and west of Tottenham Court Road. Amazon is a notable exception, however, opening a new headquarters in Shoreditch. Gerard Grech, chief executive of TechCityUK - the quango which runs TechCity in London and a number of other tech hubs by the same name - said: ‘Anybody trying to build a negative argument about the relative performance of a single postcode in East London is seriously missing the point and in danger of talking down one of this country’s great global strengths. Tech is spreading to many parts of the capital and other UK cities. ‘Outside of Silicon Valley, the UK - and London in particular - plays host to one of the biggest tech scenes on the planet. We continue to dominate tech innovation in Europe, streets ahead of Berlin, Paris and Stockholm and for good reason. Tech City UK has been, is, and will continue to play a lead role in that growth.’ According to experts, rents in the area have become so expensive, fledgling businesses are now forced to look elsewhere (pictured, the Alphabeta building) The dramatic slowdown in new business launches is not the first sign of trouble TechCity has shown. Businesses in the area have also been hampered by slow broadband speeds, MPs have claimed in the past. In some areas, it was so slow that local firms said they had trouble sending simple emails. News of the slump is likely to reignite claims that TechCity should never have launched in London in the first place. Initially the Government planned to develop TechCity in Cambridge, which already had a thriving technology industry with firms like the microchip maker ARM Holdings. However, it opted for London at the very last minute. Experts put the success of Silicon Valley down to the fact it has so many investors looking for firms to pour money into, and a ready supply of talent from world-class universities.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 13 shares Most watched News videos Serena Williams awkwardly neglects her fiancé after Aus Open win Many Clouds dies after beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Incredible moment truck crashes through middle of bus Grandma accused of killing son-in-law celebrated during testimony Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border George and Laura Bush welcome the Obamas to the White House 2009 Harriet was rescued from a South Korean meat farm Look what the cat dragged 'OUT'!

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in weather Hopkinton residents worried about subdivision traffic Sunday Jan 15, 2017 at 7:06 PM Jan 15, 2017 at 7:06 PM Jonathan Phelps @JPhelps_MW HOPKINTON — A plan to build a 34-lot subdivision that will connect Chamberlain Street and Whalen Road has residents on those streets worried about cut-through traffic.  Developer Paul Mastroianni of REC Hopkinton LLC is proposing to connect the two dead-end streets, which would create a through street between Main and Hayden Rowe streets. He presented informal plans to the board on Jan. 9.  The meeting drew a few dozen people who crammed into a small Town Hall conference room. Mastroianni told the board he will work with neighbors. The subdivision is proposed as an Open Space and Landscape Preservation Development, which aims to promote open space and natural landscape preservation. Planning Board Chairman Ken Weismantel said this is likely the largest subdivision proposed in the past 10 years, outside of Legacy Farms on East Main Street. He said "90 percent of the people" are likely worried about traffic.  "There will be a lot of bypass traffic that will find it on Google an Waze," he said of the GPS apps on cellphones.  Don Keavany, of 14 Whalen Road, said the new street will divert most traffic looking to get to EMC Park or the new elementary school being built, both on Hayden Rowe Street. "It is going to be an overwhelming overload of vehicles," he said.  He said he'd like to see two cul-de-sacs instead of the connector road.  "If it works for the builder it certainty works for me and for Whalen Road," he said. "That is my No. 1 concern. " Weismantel said it wouldn't be allowed because the town only allows 10-lot cul-de-sacs that are less than 1,000 feet long for this type of development.  "We also don't allow a cul-de-sac on top of a cul-de-sac," he said, noting the Fire Department prefers access from both sides.  Several residents asked if only emergency vehicles could travel in between.  "That might be something that should be explored," Weismantel said.  Kathi Sherry of REC Hopkinton said Mastroianni owns 102 acres between the two streets, with about 52 acres set to be preserved.  The plans call for 13 lots off Whalen an 21 lots of Chamberlain. The lots will range from one acre to about three acres. "We are planning on four-bedroom houses ranging in size from around 3,000-square-feet potentially up to 4,500-square-feet," Sherry said.  Sherry said plans are not finalized on water and sewer.  "We did want to make sure we had a plan that, if that is not available, that each lot could support its own well and a a private septic," she said.  Mastroianni said he will likely file formal plan in 30 to 60 days, but is waiting for a traffic study.  Jonathan Phelps can be reached at 508-626-4338 or jphelps@wickedlocal.com.

Gmail keeps making it harder and harder. Details below. I have two gmail accounts, one primary, the other secondary. My iPhone defaults to sending mail from primary account. If I send email to that same account, Google gets erratic. It doesn't like self-directed mail. So when I need to send to myself, I send to my secondary account. And I configured the secondary account to forward incoming mail to my primary account. That's my workaround, and it's served me for years. Until a month or two ago. Now, emails sent from primary account to my secondary account bypass the In box and go straight to All Mail. So I mostly miss them. Is there a simple fix, and/or a simpler way of doing things? Gmail can be pretty opaque.... posted by Quisp Lover to Computers & Internet (18 answers total) 2 users marked this as a favorite   Argh. Fixing an ambiguity: Until a month or two ago. Now, emails sent from primary account to my secondary account bypass the In box and go straight to All Mail. So I mostly miss them. They bypass the In box of my primary account (to which, as I said, they forward). posted by Quisp Lover at 4:24 PM on January 15 Huh. That's weird. I email myself All. The. Time. And have other addresses that forward to my primary account. Gmail has given me none of the issues you are reporting. Could this be an iphone issue? posted by Michele in California at 4:33 PM on January 15 [26 favorites] I've never had an issue sending myself an email on Gmail. I just tested it - sent an email to my Gmail account, from that same Gmail account. It just showed up in the Inbox as an unread email. There's no reason why sending yourself an email shouldn't work. Could be an iPhone issue though, I don't have one to test. If I send email to that same account, Google gets erratic. What happens, exactly? Now, emails sent from primary account to my secondary account bypass the In box and go straight to All Mail. The part about skipping the Inbox makes me wonder if you have a Filter set up that does the Skip Inbox action on those incoming emails forwarded from your second account. posted by EndsOfInvention at 4:41 PM on January 15 [3 favorites] I also Gmail myself all the time. I have a filter to automatically mark emails from me to me as read because I don't want to have to open them right after I send them, and that works just fine and they stay in my inbox. You may want to review all your active filters to see if you did something strange at some point. posted by brainmouse at 4:45 PM on January 15 I also came in to suggest reviewing your filters list to see if something's gone awry. I email myself in Gmail all the time (and always via my iPhone) and I deliberately created a filter to always mark emails from me to me as read. Or maybe go ahead create a new filter NOW so that emails from you to you are always starred/marked as important/whatever and see if that part works? posted by anderjen at 5:02 PM on January 15 [2 favorites] I email myself all the time from my iPhone. Do you use Mail or the Gmail app? Does it happen with both? . Also if you are emailing yourself, you could just pluck the message straight out of your sent mail, it doesn't even have to make it to your inbox. That said, there is likely some filter that is being triggered that is causing this auto-archiving to happen. You can try clicking this link or checking your own filters yourself to see if something weird is set up in there. posted by jessamyn at 5:03 PM on January 15 Agreeing with everybody else -- I do this 10x per day minimum with no trouble, from iPhone, with the app and without it. posted by BlahLaLa at 6:05 PM on January 15 Another chronic self-mailer reporting in. I don't have an iPhone, but I haven't noticed any irregularities. (I also set up a filter so that all emails sent from myself to myself are automatically tagged "Note to Self.") posted by Faint of Butt at 6:20 PM on January 15 [1 favorite] I used to self-mail. Now my Draft folder is 99% full of notes to myself, which I can update at will and won't get lost amidst my other emails. posted by steady-state strawberry at 8:35 PM on January 15 [7 favorites] I wonder if your primary account is downgrading the importance of mail coming from your secondary account because every dang message that comes from that email address is a FWD. Can you create a rule or filter so that every message from that address gets sent to your Inbox? posted by baseballpajamas at 9:37 PM on January 15 [2 favorites] Seconding the use of Drafts if these are notes you're sending to yourself. Another upside of Drafts is that they're not going through any sendmail servers, so the "only" copy is on Google servers, and that one gets overwritten or deleted if you modify or delete the draft. Scarequotes because of course Google has server farms so there could be more than one copy on Google servers, but that's still a lot less of a security worry than copies on a bunch of intermediary servers. For emails sent to yourself as documentation, definitely send to yourself, do not use Drafts. That way you will have unmodifiable, timestamped proof. Can you tell I'm someone who emails herself? Never had issues either, have two Gmail accounts and an iPhone. I think there's a filter thing going on. posted by fraula at 1:36 AM on January 16 [1 favorite] The other option is to set up a filter to apply a label of your choice to emails from yourself, and that allows them to be collected and reviewed in one place. posted by megatherium at 4:33 AM on January 16 Agree that you should check your filter situation, but as an alternative, you might want to try Captio or a similar app. After setup, you just tap the app icon, type your note, and it automatically emails you. Pretty nifty (though admittedly not as satisfying as figuring out what's happening in Gmail itself). posted by whoiam at 8:19 AM on January 16 [2 favorites] My iPhone defaults to sending mail from primary account. If I send email to that same account, Google gets erratic. It doesn't like self-directed mail. Chiming in as another serial self-emailer. I have multiple gmail and Exchange accounts set up on my iPhone Mail app, and have problems sending From my primary gmail, To my primary gmail. The message hangs in Outgoing before finally giving an error about the SMTP server being configured incorrectly. Which it's not. I figured it was an iOS issue. I've worked around this by sending To my primary gmail, From my secondary gmail. Once in a while it still gives an SMTO error, but resolves quickly. posted by rhapsodie at 10:48 AM on January 16 Ok, thanks, all. I will very thoroughly review the filters on both accounts, do some serious testing, and, if the problem persists, post more specifically about what's going on in a new question next week. I'm not having rhapsodie's problem, specifically, but curious to see if anyone knows a solution. posted by Quisp Lover at 11:00 AM on January 16 Captio looks cool, whoiam, thanks. If I can just find a way to Workflow these notes into my cross-platform To-Do manager ("The Hits List"), I'll be all set! Drafts is also smart, though it creates a bit of a big sloppy mess in the drafts folder. posted by Quisp Lover at 11:05 AM on January 16 I'll review this thread again later. But I'll pass on what I have heard from my club's IT guy. I have two gmail accounts: One is myname@gmail.com, the other is myjob@club.com (for my correspondence as a club officer). (I don't understand how mail via club.com (not addressed to gmail.com) can be "gmail," but I guess the club account is a Google account or something, so it is in fact gmail. I'm sure others will understand how that works better than I do.) All mail from third parties to myjob@club.com is auto forwarded to myname@gmail.com because we set it up to do that. However, if I send a message to myjob@club.com, it is not forwarded to myname@gmail.com. The IT guy says that's just the way gmail works -- it simply doesn't allow me to write "to myself" in this way, writing to the club account expecting it to be forwarded to my main account. posted by JimN2TAW at 11:47 AM on January 16 I also self-mail in my gmail account all the time and have had no issues. I'm wondering if you "upgraded" to Inbox? If so maybe that's the problem? posted by rabbitrabbit at 4:32 PM on January 16 « Older Please recommend a long handled hand held...   |   Having friends is making me anxious Newer » You are not logged in, either login or create an account to post comments Related Questions Compartmentalized brain, compartmentalized inbox.

A concept rendering of what the Samsung Galaxy S8 could look like. Image: Steel drake/behance By Raymond Wong2017-01-16 04:09:10 UTC Samsung's next flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, will be arriving very soon. The pressure is on for the Korean electronics giant to deliver a flagship phone that not only improves on the specs of last year's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, but also kicks the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus' butt. SEE ALSO: Samsung's foldable phone could transform into a 7-inch tablet Adding more features has always been Samsung's approach with new flagships, but as the company is no doubt aware after the Galaxy Note7 literally burned out, everyone will be watching closely to see what new safety measures it includes on the S8. What exactly can we expect from the S8? Here's what we're hearing from the rumor mill. 4K upgrade? The Samsung Galaxy S7 has a Quad HD screen. Will the S8 be Samsung's first phone with a 4K display? Image: Keith hopkin/mashable Samsung's gone with Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) displays for a while now and has yet to launch a phone with a 4K screen. While rumors suggest the Galaxy S8 will finally make the leap to a larger (5.7-inch) and higher resolution 4K Super AMOLED display (3,840 x 2,160) — if only because the increased resolution and pixel density will make mobile VR look crisper — it's by no means a lock-in. Another possibility is Samsung will release two S8 phones, a "regular" model and an "Edge" model with Quad HD and 4K resolutions, respectively. According to unverifiable case schematics leaked to GSMArena, Samsung might even drop the "Edge" model and release a "Plus" model with a 6.3-inch display instead. Conversely, another report claims Samsung might ditch flat displays altogether and only launch the S8 with curved edges. (Not a terrible idea since the whole dual curved screen look has become a signature Samsung aesthetic.) It also wouldn't be a stretch if the S8's screen is HDR-ready, like the Note7 was. No home button A concept rendering of the Galaxy S8 without a home button. Image: steel drake Speaking of the display, Samsung is reportedly planning to embed the fingerprint sensor underneath it as opposed to putting it inside the home button. By doing this, Samsung will be able to either increase the screen size and keep the S8's phone dimensions the same (or roughly the same) as the S7, or shrink the device's dimensions (specifically, the height, for better pocketing and one-handed use). A recent Samsung Display TV ad showed off a mock-up for a phone with no home button. It's unlikely Samsung leaked the S8 and was just showing a reference design, but even if the phone shown in the ad isn't the S8, it at least shows Samsung is thinking of getting rid of the home button. These renders from case makers also seem to support the curved screen and no home button design. More performance Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chip is based on a 10-nanometer process and will be in most flagship phones in 2017. Image: qualcomm If history is any indication, Samsung might release the S8 with two different processors — one powered by its own Exynos chip and another by a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. Last we heard, Samsung might go with an Exynos 8895 chip and a Mali-G71 graphics chip that is said to provide up to 1.8x more graphics performance than the S7.  The other model is expected to come with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor, which will — surprise, surprise — be produced by Samsung using its 10-nanonmeter process for greater power efficiency. With the 835 chip, the S8 would gain a 27 percent boost in performance over the S7. As for how much RAM, we're hearing some sources say 6GB of RAM and others claim 8GB. Either way, it'll be more than the S7's 4GB. Goodbye headphone jack? Will the S8 have a headphone jack or join the iPhone 7 and remove it? Image: Brittany herbert/mashable Apple caused quite a ruckus when it removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7/7 Plus. And this year, Android phone makers appear to be ready to join the #noheadphonejack club. There are conflicting reports saying Samsung will and won't ditch the headphone jack. If the S8 has a headphone jack, Samsung will be able to rub it in Apple's face. But if it doesn't — then it's time to accept it and go wireless. 'Bixby' AI assistant The iPhone has Siri, Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile phones have Cortana and Google's Pixel phones have the Assistant. Now Samsung is said to be launching its own AI digital assistant. Rumor has it that the S8 will come with its own assistant, possibly called "Bixby" and powered by Viv, the artificial intelligence assistant Samsung acquired in October. Interestingly, the creators of Viv are the same people who created Siri before selling it to Apple.  Assuming Samsung doesn't dumb Viv down, it could stomp all over Siri. Weatherproof The Galaxy S7 is IP68-rated water and dust-resistant. Image: Brittany Herbert/Mashable Samsung's been waterproofing its phones for years. With the S7 and S7 Edge, the company stepped up its Ingress Protection rating to IP68, meaning the phones can be submerged in up to 4.9 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Additionally, the IP68 rating means they're dust, dirt and sand resistant without needing any caps or covers. With that level of protection, it seems unlikely Samsung would take a step back with the S8 and nix the weatherproofing. According to The Investor, the S8 will sport the same IP68 rating, making it just as weatherproof as its predecessor. One or two cameras? Will the S8 have one or two rear cameras? That is the question. Image: Brittany Herbert/Mashable So far, we've heard almost nothing about what kind of improvements will be made to the S8's cameras.  The logical thing would be for the company to copy Apple's iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera setup. After all, any phone that uses Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 chip will be able to support dual cameras without any complex wizardry. The closest clue to Samsung pursuing dual cameras for the S8 is a patent Samsung filed previously. But like all patents, it may never end up in any real product. As for the front-facing camera, Pocketnow claims Samsung will give the S8 and 8-megapixel camera with autofocus (up from 5 megapixels on the S7/S7 Edge). Sharper selfies than the iPhone 7 (7 megapixels)? Yes, please! Release date Traditionally, Samsung has used the annual Mobile World Congress as the stage to announce its new flagship phones. However, this year might be different. Word on the street is the company might skip MWC this year and hold its own own "Unpacked" event in April. It'll be later than usual, but given the disastrous Note7 launch, Samsung probably isn't taking any chances. Everything else As much as we think we know about the S8, there's still a lot that we don't know. For example, how big will the battery be, and what will the software will look like? Will the front-facing camera get an upgrade? Will the S8 include the Note7's iris scanner? Will there be wireless charging? How about expandable storage? Heck, we don't even know if Samsung will continue with the "glass sandwich" design it has used for the last two years. Rumors can only tell you so much, and while most of them usually end up being true, there's still plenty of room for Samsung to surprise us.

CREATIVITY Visual Storytelling Lessons to Engage Your Audience Take your storytelling cues from brands that have successfully used visuals to connect with their audience. By Anna Guerrero Anna Guerrero is the editor of Canva Design School, a blog and interactive tutorial series that empowers people to learn design. @AnnaIsabella92 Editor, Canva Design School@AnnaIsabella92 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Visual storytelling is a cornerstone of modern day marketing. Instead of simply listing a product's capabilities, products are promoted through emotionally-charged narratives that engage consumers on a deeper level, and help them form emotional connections to the products. Let's consider Skype for a minute. Skype is a powerful, high functioning video chat application with many desirable features. Yet, when they market themselves, they don't simply list all the technical capabilities of the software; instead, they market themselves as a tool that connects people. Skype Their ads show how the platform allows long distance families, lovers, friends, colleagues to connect. This emotionally-charged approach to marketing is a perfect example of Skype telling its consumers a story. Why is it storytelling so important now? So, why the shift from black and white product explanations to flowery, emotional stories? The short answer is modern technology. We follow brands on social platforms, and because of this, brands' posts are a part of our every day. Whenever we refresh our Facebook newsfeed, we see a post from Coca Cola right above photos from grandma's 70th. We see branded posts alongside posts from our family and friends, so we view and consider them similarly. Storytelling is about creating brand-to-consumer connections similarly to the way you connect person-to-person - through emotions, interactions, real time events, etc. We long to create emotional connections with products and brands - this is often why we choose name brands over cheaper generic brands. We like to know that the brands we use care about us as consumers and reflect our values. 2016: the year of visual storytelling While visual storytelling is not a technique hot off the presses, it is one that has rapidly expanded over the last twelve months, particularly thanks to social media technology facilitating storytelling. By the end of 2014, photo messaging app Snapchat, released a feature called 'Snapchat Stories', a function that allowed users to upload a series of photos and videos that is available to all the users' friends for 24 hours. This feature facilitated a lot of storytelling amongst its users, with many posting photos cataloguing their day, or using the video feature to tell bitesize stories, and eventually brands hopped on too. In 2016, Instagram and Facebook both caught onto this trend and created their own functions that mirrored Snapchat's Stories, proving just how effective the storytelling function is. For example, let's look at how NASA uses the stories feature to market their content to viewers. They upload informational examples, snippets of interviews, and links to the full form content on Snapchat and Instagram. In this example below, they used a grand total of 10 images/videos to tell a story to users about control burns on spacecraft. NASA Another feature that has been on the rise in 2016 has been live video streams. Popular on Facebook, these real-time glimpses into the live goings on with a brand not only helps to connect users more intimately with the brand, but helps to tell real-time stories, as if you the consumer were speaking directly to them. A great example of a brand that uses live video is Australian brand Thankyou. They use live videos to give glimpses into their office dynamic, show them packaging orders, and the company dynamic. Thankyou Visual techniques and trends have evolved to facilitate storytelling too. Infographics in particular are continually on the rise as they interweave a narrative with facts and figures to create a more connectable and relatable content. Plus, creating infographics is no sweat nowadays. Check out Canva's infographic templates, customise it to suit your story and data, and you're ready to go. For a bit of inspiration, check out this infographic by Format that compiles a slew of information, data, and figures into a timeline-based narrative to better communicate the information. Format In short, advances in social technology have facilitated storytelling in various ways that allow for emotional connections to be more easily made. Social enterprise brand Thankyou offer another great example of this. Thankyou donates 100% of the funds raised from their products "to life-changing food, water and health and sanitation programs around the world." However, when you purchase a Thankyou product you can search the serial number on their interactive map and find out where the proceeds were sent. Thankyou How can you and your brand visually tell a story? Ready to tell your own story to your consumers? Here's how you can start. Construct a hero As Widen notes, first of all "Make your customers the hero and the product their superpower". As we mentioned earlier, storytelling is all about allowing users to connect with the story and product on emotional levels. They should feel that once your product is in their life, they will become the hero you paint them to be. Check out this video from action camera brand Go-Pro that shows the hero, a fireman, using the product, a GoPro camera, to capture his act of heroism in saving a kitten from a fire. The video is emotionally charged, has the narrative structure of a story, and establishes the user of the product as a hero. GoPro But, not all heroes are firefighters. Getty has listed a series of character archetypes used in visual storytelling, from the explorers and creators, through to the lovers, caregivers, and rebels. Construct an archetypal hero that reflects your brand and consumers, arm them with your product, and put them in a heroic situation. Show the process Everyone loves a glimpse behind the curtain at the inner workings of your brand, it helps to foster a more intimate relationship with your consumers and your brand, plus it helps you tell a story about how a product is launched, how a job gets done, or how the cogs in your machine turn. Check out how Warby Parker do just that. By showing some behind the scenes shots and sneak peaks of their new frame line photoshoot, they are bringing their consumers along on the ride, from the inception of the new line, to the staging, straight through to when the frames are put up for sale, telling them the story of a new product's launch. Warby Parker Google took a similar approach when unveiling their new logo design. They compiled a video that relayed their history, from the clunky inception of Google to the shiny, masterpiece we all know and love today. Google Everybody loves a rags to riches, and point A to point B story, so tell yours! Be proud of the process. Tell your consumers' stories When in doubt, authenticity is always a winner. Tell true stories as relayed by your consumers by sharing their experiences and crowdsourcing content. Show off how consumers are using your product and explain how they used your product and what benefit it gave them. Airbnb are experts in this field, as is evident from their social media channels full of crowdsourced imagery and recounted stories from happy customers. They relay stories celebrating unique Airbnbs, their histories, and the experience of the customers to create immersive pieces of content. Airbnb With so many brands on the market at any given time, creating unique connections with your consumers is crucial, and the best way to facilitate this is through stories. When crafting social media posts, ads, and campaigns, keep in mind that your content will be viewed alongside posts from family and friends. Instead of simply listing the abilities of your product, try to connect with your audience by appealing directly to their emotions and showing how your product can directly benefit their lives. Tell a story to your consumers about your consumers. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Jan 15, 2017 Advertisement

Budget 2017: Why a post-Budget fall won't mean achhe din are over for markets. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage BENGALURU: Online marketplace Amazon India has expanded the scope of Amazon Service Providers Network (ASPN) by increasing the number of services to 10 from three to woo small sellers to boost their sales on the platform. The services, which include imaging, advertising and logistics, has seen 450 providers listing their business on the services.amazon.in platform to connect with sellers across 75 cities over the past 18 months. Since its launch last year, Amazon India has been promoting ASPN to increase selection from small sellers and diversify the number of sellers on its platform in accordance with the government’s rule that no single seller can contribute over 25% of the sales on an online platform. “For us, 2016 has been a great year. Our seller base increased 160% to 1.5 lakh sellers on the platform. From helping sellers on-board through imaging and cataloguing, we have also added services to grow and manage the business,” said Gopal Pillai, director and general manager of seller services at Amazon India. “One of the additional services we have launched is the Sponsored Products Optimization (SPO), a pay-per-click model for advertising, similar to Google ad-words, which is open to all sellers. It is a technology product and requires constant keyword optimisations, changing bids for these keywords and reiteration to see what is working and isn’t,” added Pillai. Currently, the ratio of brands to sellers using SPO is 1:2 where sellers want to optimise their spends for showing listed products among the top search results Large brands usually partner with Amazon marketplace to promote their products through brand page creation, banner ads and others as their spends on digital marketing are higher than the average seller. “We started with paying Rs 10,000 to a third-party service provider for optimising SPO. We have increased our budget to Rs 2 lakh per month this year after six months of using the service. An investment of Rs 2 lakh on the ad spends guarantees sales of Rs 18-20 lakh,” says Karamveerji, a Delhibased seller of mobile phone accessories under the brand name Cheverone. This contributes to advertising revenue for Amazon India platform while the transaction between the seller and SPO provider remain out of the purview of the marketplace. However, Amazon helps the service providers design their promotions during the festive and sale season to promote seller participation in the event.

The fourth quarter of 2016 showed a 30 percent increase in unique visitors over Q3, and a 400 percent increase over the previous year. These results were fueled by a recently refreshed design, enhanced content and search capabilities, the launch of the Kazzit mobile app, and international expansion into 17 new countries. In just three months, Kazzit has surpassed its established competitors in traffic and engagement according to global website rankings (*see NOTE 1). With over 50K unique users and 124K page views per month, Kazzit is now ranked at 342K globally, with a domestic ranking of 68K in the United States – a major feat for a wine-tourism website. Still 100 percent free to consumers, wine lovers and curious epicurean travelers use Kazzit’s dynamic search capability to seek out specific wineries, discover new ones based on region or preferences (i.e., wineries that specialize in specific varieties or styles), and also to find the perfect winery setting for events like weddings, corporate retreats, and educational seminars. This micro-level of personalization to consumer search demand has positioned Kazzit as a leader in wine consumer data – a benefit that Kazzit’s winery partners are beginning to capitalize on at a B2B level. Aside from the user reviews, Kazzit’s elastic, open-ended search capabilities have unlocked an unprecedented amount of data that partner wineries can access; for example, the trendiest wine style in the month of September, the most popular types of winery events in the Finger Lakes, the demographic most likely to seek out white wine in winter, or the most searched wine regions overall. Founder Babak Motamedi has plans to publish some of this data in a regular quarterly industry report launching in 2017. No single platform has ever had access to this level of micro-data in the wine industry, and Kazzit is thus poised to take wine marketing to the next level, as boutique wineries find themselves now capable of unlocking a new level of exposure and engagement never before seen. Kazzit’s recently launched mobile app has helped facilitate more spontaneous searching on-the-go, and wineries can also now capitalize, publishing timely deals directly to the platform and utilizing Kazzit as a marketing partner arm to help opportunistically attract potential customers nearby. Since its soft-launch in 2014, Kazzit now has a database of over 10,000 wineries (over 9,000 more than its closest competitor) across North & South America, Europe, Africa and Australia, and surpassed 60,000 unique users last month (adding 600+ per day on average). With its 92/100 Google experience ranking, wine lovers and industry insiders alike are drawn to Kazzit for its ease of use, online reservation system, detailed winery information and reviews, and educational wine blog, written by sommeliers, which is updated almost daily. Since 2014, the average organic visitor to Kazzit spends over 4 minutes and 7 seconds on the site (58 seconds is the standard), with a return rate of 30-40 percent. Return users average 11.5 minutes on return visits, clicking an average of 8.6 pages deep reading about wineries (a huge number by any digital marketing standard). About Kazzit: Kazzit stands out as the world’s most comprehensive online winery resource, serving as the ultimate all-inclusive online community, connecting wineries, vineyards, restaurateurs, collectors, sales people and enthusiasts, and helping them share services, products, experiences and consumer applications. Kazzit helps wineries connect with both trade and consumers by providing comprehensive winery profiles, winery ratings, photo galleries, maps, real-time social media updates, upcoming winery events and a means to book wine tastings and plan wine trips all in one place. The brainchild of Phoenix restaurateur Peter Kasperski and serial entrepreneur Babak Motamedi, Kazzit was founded in February 2014 after the two wine-loving friends grew frustrated at the lack of comprehensive travel planning sites specifically built for wine tourism. The name Kazzit pays tribute to the friendship between founders Motamedi & Kasperski, which had its genesis at Kazimierz Wine Bar near what would become Kazzit’s headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Fund, conceived the idea for the Rev. Martin Luther King Day event, "Men of Courage." | Provided photo Maudlyne Ihejirika @maudlynei | email Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter  Sign-Up When Shawn Wilson conceived the idea for a unique mentoring program bringing diverse black men together to consider issues facing their community as part of a Martin Luther King Day of action, he thought of his own upbringing, and to what and to whom he owed his success. Wilson, 42, of Detroit, manager of multicultural community engagement for the Ford Motor Co. Fund, had grown up in Milwaukee’s inner city, his family on and off welfare. Today, he’s a successful charities executive, 2 1/2 years with Ford; before that, 10 years with R & B singer Usher’s New Look Foundation in Atlanta. “I was the first in my family to go to college, and it was having mentors that looked like me, throughout my life, that really led to my success,” Wilson said. His “Men of Courage” program will bring that diverse group from across the nation to Chicago this King Day, in a mission to rewrite what they call a stereotypical narrative of black men. “It was at the YMCA I attended, where an older gentleman, Mr. Richardson, literally took me down to the university, sat me in the dean’s office and got me enrolled. That’s what I’m trying to pass on through this program,” Wilson said. “It’s time to rewrite the narrative frequently portrayed by the media and start to tell our own narrative. We are amazing family men, businessmen, innovators, barrier breakers.” In its second year, “Men of Courage” draws on basic principles of the life of the civil rights leader who would have been 88 years old Sunday: leadership, activism, giving back, pulling others up behind you. Held simultaneously in various cities, the program brings together black men from all walks of life to share about their individual challenges and those facing black men and the black community in general. They’ll then vet solutions, and walk away with individual and group action plans — and new, unlikely networks of support. The Chicago event is being held over the course of seven hours at the downtown tech incubator, 1871. The dozens converging here range in age from 17 to 70. About 25 percent are at-risk young black men in Chicago, which saw more than 780 people killed last year, its deadliest year in over two decades. Included are the previously incarcerated, black urban professionals, corporate CEOs, celebrities. “Dr. King’s legacy, to me, is really someone who had a vision, and just an incredible ability to mobilize and build relationships across different groups of people to make real progress,” said participant Fabian Elliott, 26, of the South Loop, an ad tech consultant at Google. “I wanted to participate because I see this program as an incredible way to continue his legacy. King had a dream, and died pursuing that dream. I appreciate that we’re going to be strategizing on how to bring that vision to life,” said Fabian, also CEO of Black Tech Mecca here. High-profile participants flying in for the event include Pittsburgh Public Schools Supt. Anthony Hamlet; aviator Barrington Irving, who at age 23 became the youngest ever and first black person to pilot a plane solo around the world; NBA Hall of Famer and former Detroit Mayor Dave Bing; Detroit Lions linebacker DeAndre Levy; and rapper Doug E. Fresh. Through a digital tool kit that can be downloaded at www.menofcourage.com, the program has encouraged similar events in homes, houses of worship and workplaces nationwide on King Day. About 1,300 such gatherings will occur in Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. “We tend to always think about Martin Luther King from the standpoint of the dream. But there’s a saying that a goal without a timeline is only a dream. We want to move beyond the dream and say, ‘By when?’ ” Wilson said. “Our action pact asks everyone to make a commitment to making that vision a reality. A 17-year-old who doesn’t have resources can donate their time to an organization supporting black men. Everyone has something they can bring to the table,” he said. “Most importantly, each leaves with a commitment to hold each other accountable.” Other ways to celebrate King Day: • The Rainbow PUSH Coalition hosts the Rev.

Third set: *Tomic 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 Bellucci (*denotes server): There it is! A couple of aces (his 11th and 12th of the match) help Tomic to match point and his serve doesn’t let him down at that point.

Really, their repertoire hasn’t changed in the past 10 years.

Bellucci falls to 0-40 and Tomic converts on the second break point to move to within a game of the second set. A chorus of “Let’s go Bernie” breaks out among the Fanatics in the stands, a chant that will never get old. Or annoying. Ever. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.14pm EST 22:14 Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 4-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): Well this is something of a strange game. Tomic eventually holds, but it’s far from plain sailing. He appears to lose his momentum and allows Bellucci a sniff of getting back into the set. In the end he has to save three break points, although it’s some tame play from Bellucci when it matters most that keeps Tomic in the game. On the second, he simply stands there as Tomic’s looped forehand lands on the baseline. A big serve from the Australian saves a third break point before an ace sets up the eventual hold. That could prove to be a big one for Tomic to have got through. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.05pm EST 22:05 Second set: Tomic 6-2, 3-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Tomic edges a lengthy rally at 30-15 up when Bellucci goes wide (he challenges but to no avail), and the Australian is gifted two break points. Bellucci concedes on the first with a whimper, his forehand landing meekly in the net. Tomic now a set and a break up – and looking well set. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.01pm EST 22:01 Second set: *Tomic 6-2, 2-1 Bellucci (*denotes server): Tomic, for the first time really, struggles slightly on his serve. He comes through though, not least because he pulls a superb winner out of the bag when being put under pressure from Bellucci. His forehand is ungettable and that’s a good hold for the Australian, but you can’t help feel a bit for Bellucci, who did his best to get his opponent running all over the court that game. Tomic’s shot-making was just too good in the end. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.55pm EST 21:55 Second set: Tomic 6-2, 1-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Another game, another fantastic shot from Tomic, who runs around a Bellucci serve to slap a forehand winner back past the Brazilian.

Cue a not-annoying-at-all solo version of the Beatles’ Let It Be, with lyrics tailored to Tomic, by a brave Australian man in the crowd. Incredibly, he gets a round of applause, although you have to think that was more for effort, rather than any songwriting or execution skills.

First set: Tomic 6-2 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Oh dear, a double fault comes at a bad time for Bellucci and the Brazilian falls 0-30 down. Tomic manoeuvres his opponent around the court on the next point and sets up three set points. Bellucci saves the first, Tomic is long at the baseline on the second, and on the third, the Brazilian whips a super forehand that Tomic can’t return. Ballsy play from Bellucci. But Tomic soon gets a fourth chance though and this time he takes it, as Bellucci finds the net. Thirty-two minutes and Tomic is a set up!

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.32pm EST 21:32 First set: Tomic 3-1 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Bellucci pings down another ace early on, but the Brazilian is slightly error-prone with his ground strokes and this, coupled with some decent play from Tomic – and an element of luck – means he struggles to hold. A net cord at deuce gives the Australian a chance, but in true Tomic style, he attempts a sliced forehand dropshot to claim the game. It doesn’t come off. Bellucci relies on his serve to get him through and an ace seals the deal to finally get him on the board. Over on Show Court 3, Alex De Minaur has dropped the third set to Gerald Melzer and must find a way to stay in his debut slam in this fourth set. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.25pm EST 21:25 First set: *Tomic 3-0 Bellucci (*denotes server): Eight minutes into the match and Tomic has opened up a 3-0 lead. He’s looking comfortable during this quickfire game, in which he encounters little resistance from Bellucci, largely thanks to his own shot selection. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.22pm EST 21:22 First set: Tomic 2-0 Bellucci* (*denotes server): Bellucci is a grunter, not the loudest ever heard, but still a grunter. The Brazilian exhales loudly with every shot, in start contrast to Tomic, who manages to keep any noise down. Anyway, it’s been a great start for Tomic, who breaks at the first opportunity, despite Bellucci hammering down the first ace of the match. Tomic seals it when the Brazilian is a fraction long with a volley at the net, with Tomic unable to get near the ball. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.17pm EST 21:17 First set: *Tomic 1-0 Bellucci (*denotes server): Here we go then! Bellucci won the toss and elected to receive first so here goes Bernie. And the Australian gets off to an encouraging start, cajoling his opponent around the court on several points before sealing the game with a powerful serve that Bellucci cannot get back. Bellucci does however, give an indication of what he’s capable of, when at 30-0 down he counters with a frankly magnificent return, reaching across to fire a forehand back across Tomic. A high quality first game.

She was a break down in the second, but has just got back onto serve at 3-4 and is still a chance of wrapping this up in straight sets. And we have our first shock of the Australian Open, with fourth seeded Romanian Simona Halep bundled out of the tournament by American Shelby Rogers, a stunning 6-3, 6-1 winner first up on Rod Laver Arena. Elsewhere, Australia’s next big thing, Destanee Aiava, is locked in battle in a second set tie-break against Mona Barthel of Germany, having lost the first 6-3. More on that in a tick.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.31pm EST 20:31 Preamble So, here we go once again. The Australian Open 2016 is under way and one of our first chances to run the rule over the local talent on the sun-bathed blue courts of Melbourne Park comes with a match that pits Bernard Tomic, seeded 27, against Brazil’s world No62 Thomaz Bellucci. In some ways, it’s as an intriguing encounter as a first-round clash can be – rankings suggest Tomic should have few problems in dispatching Bellucci, but of course there is far more to it than that. For starters, it’s Bernard Tomic we’re talking about, the same Bernard Tomic who has failed to win a competitive match this year following a disappointing outing in Brisbane and two defeats in Kooyong. Bernard Tomic, who is about as predictable as the guest list for Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony. And the Bernard Tomic who delights when in the mood, and frustrates when not. Then there is Bellucci, by no means a walkover and a very real potential banana skin. The pair have met three times before, most recently at Shenzhen in China last year, where the Brazilian won 6-2, 6-2. He now holds a 2-1 advantage over Tomic following a win in Stuttgart in 2012. Victory for the Australian at the 2013 Indian Wells Masters tournament is the meat in this particular results sandwich. So which Tomic will we see today? Honestly, I’ve no idea and you’re a fool a better person than me if you think you can predict this one. Anyway, we’re about to find out soon enough. The match is scheduled second up on Margaret Court Arena, after Kiwi player Marina Erakovic and women’s seventh seed Garbiñe Muguruza are done and dusted.

Tech rogue Peter Thiel thinks so, telling the New York Times this week that he believes "the age of Apple is over." "We know what a smartphone looks like and does," said the Facebook board member, PayPal co-founder, chess prodigy, and Trump transition team member. "It's not the fault of Tim Cook, but it's not an area where there will be any more innovation." Loyal fans agree, citing lackluster "improvements," a lack of innovation, and a year that saw sales fall for the first time since 2001. As Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, the company appears to have gone into "maintenance mode" while everyone waits for its next big thing to emerge — if ever. Ronan Timoney, a 23-year-old economics and finance student in Ireland, has had Apple laptops since 2010, iPhones since 2011 and an iPad since 2012. As a young, avid Apple user, he's exactly the kind of customer the company should be wooing for their long-term success. But his most recent smartphone purchase was an Android. Play Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Apple's iPhone 7 announcement: Will the headphone jack change pay off? 1:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src="http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/760365123587" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> For him, Apple has lost its luster. "Their products have become fashion accessories rather than high-powered gadgets, and prices now outstrip quality," said Timoney. He "will not be buying any Apple products for the foreseeable future," he said. 2016 was a particularly rotten year for Apple. Annual sales fell for the first time since it launched the iPod in 2001, going from a record $234 billion in 2015 to $216 billion. Its new lineup of MacBook Pros this year failed to impress. The best thing about the iPhone 7 is its camera. It also forced users to invest in $159 wireless AirPods, which had a delayed launch, or use an awkward dongle to use their old headphones. Not very "Appley." Core Products for 2017 And what's in store for 2017? Reportedly three new faster iPad models in different sizes as the company tries to fend off other touch-screen phones and computers, but iPad units have declined in 10 of the last 11 quarters. Instead of "thinking different" the company is "thinking slightly better." To be sure, "Apple is a great American success story," but, "a lot of that innovation came from the Steve Jobs era," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners known for his bearish views on the company. CEO Tim Cook is an efficient caretaker but doesn't necessarily have the late Steve Jobs' "founder's fire" that can propel a company past the threshold of what was thought to be possible, said Gillis. "Amazon, Google, Tesla, Netflix, Facebook, what do they have in common? They're all still driven by their founders. They're still able to make big bets and change directions. Is Apple positioned for the next thing?" asked Gillis. Related: Apple's Poor Performance Takes a Bite out of Tim Cook's Salary That's the big question as longtime users and investors wait to see where the company's $2 billion annual increase in research and development has been going and on what acronym it might it plant a flag next. AR? IOT? VR? AI? "What you're seeing is a point where Apple is making a slower transition away from being a company that historically came out with whizzbang products every couple of years to a company that makes great products we all need," said Gene Munster, the co-founder of Loup Ventures, who previously covered Apple as a Piper Jaffray analyst for over a decade and remains bullish. "As they shift resources, you get what happened in 2016: Not that exciting of a product year." Who's Driving Innovation? He thinks the next big things for Apple will be whatever it decides to do in the car space, artificial intelligence, and, according to the kind of Apple rumors that used to capture fanboys' and pundits' imaginations, a foldable phone with bendable glass. But it won't be Apple making the device, countered Gillis. "They're not driving the innovation... Samsung will be the ones who make it." Even hardcore Apple users say they've noticed a change. Apple is becoming more like Microsoft, a former wunderkind that became large, profitable, boring, and angered pro users. Is Microsoft the New Apple? As a Mac user, I.T. manager Dan Fox is used to standing out at his PC-filled office at an Orlando-based engineering firm. "Apple made these gorgeous, sleek, shiny devices that looked like they were from the future," he told NBC News. "They were cooler than anything else on the market and, more importantly, they actually worked better," said the 45-year-old Fox. His family members are all Apple fans too, and their house is full of MacBooks, Apple Watches, iPads, iPhones, Apple TVs, and he even sprang for the AirPods. As of late though, the "cutting edge" upgrades to the Surface and Office 365 have him considering that Microsoft might be becoming the new Apple, with well-built and innovative products, he says, that show an attention to details. He still loves Apple, but says he feels "Improvements are iterative, and it's almost as though Apple is now relying on its brand more than its tech. It feels like they are stalling on innovation to squeeze one more model out with a tiny upgrade. Rinse. Repeat. Things are starting to feel… stale."

The Korea Herald > Business > Technology Naver’s Line ranks No. 2 in global app sales   Published : 2017-01-16 12:20 Updated : 2017-01-16 22:44 Line, the mobile messenger established by South Korean internet giant Naver, was the second-most profitable app in the world in 2016, a new year-end report from Sensor Tower showed Monday. According to the mobile app marketing intelligence firm, global music streaming app Spotify generated the highest revenue in the nongame app category for the Apple App Store and the Google Play app store combined. Line came in second, followed by US-based movie and television show streaming service Netflix, online dating app Tinder and internet radio app Pandora, Sensor Tower said. (123RF) On the Apple App Store, Spotify ranked first in terms of revenue, followed by Netflix and Line. On Google Play, however, Line ranked first thanks to the “sales of its stickers and other purchasable items,” followed by Tinder and Pandora. The US market research company also highlighted the rise of Line Manga, the online comic reader and sales platform operated by Line, which ranked No. 7 in overall revenue for both app stores combined. “The real standout we saw across all three rankings (overall, Apple App Store and Google Play), however, was Line Manga, the eponymous chat platform’s comic reader/storefront, which launched in late 2015 and has been a growing source of revenue for the company ever since,” Sensor Tower said. The most-downloaded app of 2016 overall on both Apple and Google’s app stores was Facebook, followed by Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat. With the exception of Snapchat, all of the top five apps are owned by US social networking giant Facebook.

The company, founded in 2011 by two University of Waterloo grads, focuses on teaching machines to read like a human brain – a massive computer science challenge that has bedevilled researchers for decades. Early on, the company also developed language-recognition software for voice assistants in smartphones and cars.The company raised $9-million in venture funding in January, 2016, but neither company released details Friday about the sale price. A statement from a Microsoft spokesperson didn’t rule out possible layoffs among the 50 current employees. “Microsoft representatives met with Maluuba employees earlier today in both Waterloo and Montreal. We are currently working on integration plans and expect most, if not all, employees will join Microsoft.” In the statement announcing the acquisition, Maluuba co-founders Sam Pasupalak and Kaheer Suleman said the rationale for selling was to bolster resources.“Early research achievements [in machine-reading comprehension, memory, common-sense reasoning] accelerated our need to scale our team rapidly; it was apparent that we needed to bolster our work with significant resources to advance towards solving artificial general intelligence.” Microsoft also announced Friday that Yoshua Bengio – one of the leading lights on deep learning as well as the head of the University of Montreal’s Institute for Learning Algorithms – would become an adviser to the company’s Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, much as he had been advising Maluuba. Maluuba makes much of its research available to other AI developers. In November and December, it released massive datasets that assist with question-and-answer scenarios as well as a product that helps machines remember and contextualize a string of dialogue. Just a month ago it partnered with McGill University’s Reasoning and Learning Lab, a collaboration that received an NSERC Engage grant from the federal government. Canadian machine-learning researchers have been hot properties as the world’s biggest companies seek to make devices and software more intelligent. In 2013, Google hired deep learning and neural network pioneer Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto. Former University of Toronto machine-learning professor Ruslan Salakhutdinov (more recently of Carnegie Mellon University) was hired in October by Apple to help it improve its Siri voice assistant.

(Photo: Romain Blanquart, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo Story Highlights The 2017 auto show will pump an estimated $450 million into the local economy Detroit campaigned for years to get its coveted spot on the international auto show calendar The show is Cobo Center's biggest tenant The North American International Auto Show pours hundreds of millions of dollars into southeast Michigan’s economy and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors. It’s one of Michigan’s crown jewels. Let’s not kill this golden goose. That would be the result of well-intentioned, but poorly considered, suggestions the show move to a sunnier season. That would decimate the $450 million the show generated this year and throw a monkey wrench into Cobo Center’s growing business hosting other events. Why is the latest call for moving the show to May a terrible idea? We all love May. The river is blue, the flowers are in bloom, the sidewalk cafés are filled. Let me count the ways moving the show would be a disaster. More Detroit auto show: DETROIT FREE PRESS Gone, and mostly forgotten: Discontinued cars and trucks DETROIT FREE PRESS The 14 most interesting vehicles going on sale in 2017 The show does not exist in a vacuum. It’s one element in a complicated schedule of auto shows around the world. Detroit does not have a God-given right to host one of the world’s half dozen great auto shows, and enjoy the international attention and investment that come with it. There’s a finely tuned system of leading international auto shows that existed for decades before Detroit came to the party. They can go on very nicely without us. Before Detroit gained its coveted spot on that calendar, not even local automakers and journalists paid much attention to it. That’s a far cry from the dozens of headline-making vehicle introductions and months of work for well-paid skilled trade workers it creates now.

This year, the Chevrolet Traverse, Toyota Camry, Lexus LS, BMW 5-series, Volkswagen Tiguan and Audi Q8 concept led a host of unveilings. Detroit grabbed them ahead of auto shows in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Geneva, Switzerland, and scores of others that would love the attention and money that comes with hosting worldwide vehicle unveilings. At least 3,000 skilled workers — electricians, carpenters, stagehands and more  work at Cobo Center from late October through mid-January to build the stands and run the events that come with being a top international auto show, Cobo Center general manager Claude Molinari said. When the show begins, thousands of executives, engineers and journalists from around the world come to Detroit for days in January — traditionally a dead zone for local hotels and restaurants — for the auto show and Automotive News World Congress that Detroit-based Crain Communications holds after the show’s press events. The auto show is Cobo’s biggest tenant, but the convention center has contracts for more than 300 events every year. “The auto show works in its current time because it lets us book other major events in spring and summer, the times convention planners want,” Molinari said. “We have events booked to 2025. Our calendar is a huge puzzle of interlocking pieces.” Detroit Auto Show: Public Days Your complete guide to the Detroit auto show 11 restaurants you can walk to from Cobo Downtown bars you can walk to from Cobo The 8 most important vehicles at the Detroit auto show 5 high-tech exhibits you must try at the Detroit auto show Full coverage To sell cars The Detroit auto show got its spot on the calendar after years of negotiating and politicking with OICA, the international group that decides which auto shows get coveted international status. Leaders of the Detroit Auto Dealers Association (DADA) travel to automaker headquarters and other auto shows throughout the year to secure the high-profile vehicle unveilings that draw the media attention automakers crave. “We’re one of the top three auto shows in the world, and the timing is an important part of that,” DADA executive director Rod Alberts said. “We pride ourselves on being the first major auto show of the year. Automakers like that.” They also like to sell cars, and that’s why the auto show has been in January for decades, even before it gained international standing in 1989. “January is the slowest time of the year for selling cars,” Alberts said. “The excitement of going to the show and the media coverage of new vehicles brings customers to dealers.” May through September, the alternatives most commonly suggested as NAIAS dates, are the high season for car sales. Dealers don’t need a boost then; they do in January. A big colorful and dramatic event like the auto show is also more likely to draw customers in the winter. Moving NAIAS to spring, summer or fall would put it in competition with everything from baseball and football games to barbecues, high school graduations, weekends Up North and golf outings.

Moving the show would almost certainly end the big, flashy vehicle unveilings that draw so much attention and drive automakers’ massive spending. Loomis Sayles economist David Sowerby estimates the 2017 show brought $450 million to southeast Michigan, up from $430 million last year. It takes months to set up the elaborate displays at NAIAS, compared to a few days for a show with less manufacturer involvement, like those in Chicago, Miami and Dallas. A change to spring or summer would cost Detroit its hard-won spot as the year’s first major auto show, and move it into the territory of other established shows like New York, Shanghai, Beijing, Frankfurt and Paris. “You don’t move the Indy 500 to the same month as the Daytona 500,” Alberts said. Leading auto shows, including NAIAS, have spent the last few years running scared as automakers made major announcements at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which takes place in Las Vegas immediately before NAIAS. CES may have passed peak auto significance, though. The auto announcements there this year were minor, and Silicon Valley king Google chose NAIAS, not CES, to lay out its vision of the future and reveal the autonomous minivan Chrysler built for it. “The automotive component of CES has reached saturation point,” Society of Automotive Engineers editorial director Bill Visnic said. “Nobody there is saying, ‘This will be your next car.’ We’re past the time for vague promises by tech companies.” IHS Automotive senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said CES is a good place for business-to-business demonstrations of technologies that may reach production in five to 10 years, “but there’s a real disconnect if people are looking for a car they can buy tomorrow. People don’t buy a navigation system; they buy a car.” NAIAS can move within a window of a few days in January, but rescheduling out of winter would cost southeast Michigan millions of dollars and thousands of visitors every year. Honestly, when was the last time you saw a beautiful spring evening and said, “I can’t wait to go inside and walk around in a hot sweaty building?” Michigan has a good thing in the North American International Auto Show.
