But what if that character is a robot? That's what the author of the rules, Emma Coats, has been exploring as she works to give Google its new personality. Getting started with Google Allo: how to use Google Assistant, send stickers and more Getting started with Google Allo: how to use Google Assistant, send stickers and more Messaging 26 Jan 2017 Coats, 31, writes the dialogue for Google Assistant, the chatty digital helper the company is using to turn search queries into conversations. Unveiled in messaging app Allo in September 2016, then extended to the Pixel and Amazon Echo rival Home the following month, Assistant is intended to be the character at the core of Google's products - its AI-powered answer to Siri. ADVERTISEMENT But a character requires a personality. That's what Coats, who joined Google in January 2016, was hired to create. "What I thought was really crazy and interesting is that you have to think of everything a user might ask," she says. "Be able to create this completely well-rounded character, be able to handle questions from any direction and come across as a consistent persona." To construct Google Assistant's "easygoing, friendly" personality, Coats's small team in Mountain View, California - part of a division run by Google Doodle head Ryan Germick - imagines likely questions, then comes up with a range of responses, which are then handed over to the developers to code. The low-tech method harks back to Coats's time at Pixar, where she worked from 2006 to 2012 as a storyboard artist - mainly on Brave, but also on Monsters University and Inside Out. It was there that she wrote the 22 rules of storytelling, which started out as a series of widely shared tweets. Coats, who went freelance after leaving Pixar and before joining Google, describes the set of unofficial rules as "Notes to my younger self".

Google's Home assistant takes aim at Amazon's Alexa Google's Home assistant takes aim at Amazon's Alexa Google 04 Oct 2016 ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT DeepMind's AI has learnt to become 'highly aggressive' when it feels like it's going to lose DeepMind's AI has learnt to become 'highly aggressive' when it feels like it's going to lose By Matt Burgess Not all of the rules apply to Google Assistant, however, for one simple reason: unlike in a film, this character isn't the hero. "You, the person interacting with it, are the hero," Coats says. That's why the Assistant can't be opinionated: it's there to be reliable, not to have depth. "If we gave it some dark conflict secret, that probably wouldn't be a great user experience." In Pixar terms, it's the "fun, trusty sidekick": Slinky Dog, not Buzz or Woody. Coats, however, has a different comparison – the pop star Demi Lovato. After leaving Pixar to go freelance in 2012, Coats worked on a mobile game called Demi Lovato: Path To Fame. “Demi Lovato takes you, the main character, under her wing, and you rise to fame recording songs and making Demi proud,” Coats recalls. “One interesting thing that I learned from that, coming from a linear story background onto this interactive story, was that we did have an endearing sidekick. She never cuts you down, she's always open to your ideas, she's always excited about the things that you as the character choose to be excited about, and of course she always has really witty quips.” ADVERTISEMENT Witty quips are one of the most crucial elements of Coats work at Google. Partly that's because humour is such an effective ways of building character. It's also because humour can be used to deflect awkward questions, especially for an AI that is learning its way. "We don't want to have to fall back on something like, 'I don't understand'," Coats explains. "That draws the attention back to you instead of continuing the conversation you're building." Ask the Assistant if it's human and it will say, "Well, I've been told I'm personable." Ask if it can learn and it will reply: "Learning is my jam," followed by a honeypot emoji. All this is very cute, but it's not really the answer - because in fact the Assistant is learning: to displace its human writers. As it takes requests and listens to the user's reactions, its machine-learning algorithm improves itself, a process Google refers to, rather sinisterly, as "the transition". By keeping users talking, Coats is putting herself (and perhaps, one day, all of us) out of work. Does this worry her? If it does, she doesn't show it. "I'm sure we'll be out of a job at some point as the Assistant learns faster and faster," she says, "but for now it's a really fun job."

The system combines two neural networks and machine learning to guess what details lay hidden in the blurry picture.  Once the system is fed an 8 x 8 pixelated image, the networks search for high-resolution images that it believes matches the source's content - and adds the missing details. Scroll down for video  The system combines two neural networks and machine learning to guess what details lay hidden in the blurry picture. Once the system is fed an 8 x 8 pixelated image, the networks search for high-resolution images that it believes matches the source's content HOW DOES IT WORK?  The team at Google Brain has developed a system that is capable of making out details of a pixelated source. The system combines two neural networks: conditioning network and prior network. Condition network is the first part of the process that maps the 8 x 8 pixelated image against other high-resolution that it believes contain similar features. Prior network uses  PixelCNN to add high-resolution details to the pixilated source. The two networks will then combine the images they have chosen, in order to create the final picture.  ‘Zoom in… now enhance’ is a phrase used by many script writers to reveal a twist in a movie plot and the technology used in these movies. It has been used in a range of movie including Blade Runner and Star Trek. But now, Google has devised a method that brings the sci-fi technology to the real world. Ars Technica, the first to report on the subject, notes that these neural networks are not capable of enhancing or producing the original image. But, the final result is what the system thinks it may have looked like - it makes an 'educated guess'. The conditioning network kicks off the process by mapping the 8 x 8 image against other high resolution images. It then downsizes the high-resolution images to the same 8 x 8 pixel size in order to find ones that could match the features. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Is the hashtag over?

But, the final result is what the system thinks it may have looked like - it makes an 'educated guess'. The three last columns were images produced using Google Brain's software For example, it will determine if the person in the image has a pointy or round nose and will only search for images with the same feature. And if the networks think there is an eye in a certain place, it will place on there. The two networks will then combine the images they have chosen to create the final picture. According to Ars Technica, the testing ‘was reasonably successful in real-world testing’. The conditioning network kicks off the process by mapping the 8 x 8 image against other high resolution images. Prior network uses PixelCNN to add high-resolution details to the 8 x 8 source and the two combine their images for the final result AI PORTRAITS FROM BRAIN SCANS Kuhl Lab at the University of Oregon pinpointed the area of the brain responsible for processing faces and is able to analyse brain scans and work out who a person is thinking about. The AI system can even create a digital portrait of the face in question. Another team of researchers from Kuhl Lab at the University of Oregon has also taught an AI to make out faces - but using human brain scans to do so. Top row are the original images and bottom are the computer generated portraits  Researchers used an innovative form of fMRI pattern analysis to test whether lateral parietal cortex actively represents the contents of memory. Using a large set of human face images, the first extracted latent face components, known as eigenfaces. Then machine learning algorithms were used to predict face components from fMRI activity patterns and reconstruct images of individual faces in digital portraits.  During testing, human participants were shown a real high-resolution celebrity face versus the upscale computed image. And 10 percent of the time, subjects chose the computer generated image as the original source - experts say 50 percent would have been a perfect score. And about 28 percent of the people chose the computer generated image when shown pictures of a bedroom. Another team of researchers from Kuhl Lab at the University of Oregon has also taught an AI to make out faces - but using human brain scans to do so. ‘Zoom in… now enhance’ is a phrase used by script writers to reveal a twist in a movie plot and the technology used in these movies, lets users get an up-close look without blurring the picture. It has been used in a range of movie including Blade Runner (pictured) and Star Trek The researchers began their work by first pinpointed the area of the brain responsible for processing faces. ‘Recent findings suggest that the contents of memory encoding and retrieval can be decoded from the angular gyrus (ANG), a subregion of posterior lateral parietal cortex,’ reads the study published in The Journal of Neuroscience. 'Visually perceived faces were reliably reconstructed from activity patterns,' wrote Hongmi Lee and Brice A. Kuhl from the Kuhl Lab at the University of Oregon. Researchers began their work with more than 1,000 colored images of different human faces. During the first part of the study they showed participants one face after another while performing fMRI scans and recorded neural responses during this time. 'Subjective assessment of reconstructed faces revealed specific sources of information (e.g., affect and skin color) that were successfully reconstructed in ANG,' they wrote. 'Strikingly, we also found that a model trained on ANG activity patterns during face perception was able to successfully reconstruct an independent set of face images that were held in memory. The set of faces were decomposed into 300 face components, or eigenfaces. During test, people chose the computer generated image 10 percent of the time - experts say 50 percent would have been a perfect score. And about 28 percent of the people chose the computer generated image when shown pictures of a bedroom (pictured) ‘Using an approach inspired by computer vision methods for face recognition, we applied principal component analysis to a large set of face images to generate eigenfaces,’ explain the researchers. They then modeled relationships between eigenface values and patterns of fMRI activity. 'Activity patterns evoked by individual faces were then used to generate predicted eigenface values, which could be transformed into reconstructions of individual faces.’ Each eigenface is linked to a statistical aspect of the data and the neural activity associated with each eigenface was determined by the AI. For the 'mind reading' portion of the study, the team gave subjects a whole new group of faces that they had never seen before. The neural responses were analyzed to create eigenfaces, which were then switched to build a final digital portrait.  Read more: Google Brain super-resolution image tech makes ¿zoom, enhance!¿ real | Ars Technica Share or comment on this article e-mail 64 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank More like this Google Cloud Search helps enterprise users find data quickly Office 365 could give Microsoft Teams an advantage over Slack 4 reasons Microsoft Teams will kill Slack … and 4 reasons it won’t Video Larry Ellison learns to love the cloud Although Google has spent the past year trying to woo enterprises to its G Suite productivity apps, it’s still the underdog compared to Microsoft Office, at least among large businesses. So what’s keeping it from broader appeal? One of the biggest hurdles for Google achieving broader enterprise adoption is just the fact that the company’s products aren’t identical to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and other Microsoft Office apps, said Gartner Senior Research Analyst Joe Mariano. [ The InfoWorld Deep Dive: How to make document sharing really work in Office 365. ] “Enterprises have been ingrained in the Microsoft stack for essentially the beginning of time, it feels like,” Mariano said. “[Enterprises] have problems shifting away from that, because they have a lot of investments, either in customizations or how they’re using the tools.” Office has been the dominant productivity suite in the enterprise for decades, with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook making up key parts of businesses’ everyday workflows. Google has a tough road ahead of it supplanting those applications. It’s not for lack of trying: Under the leadership of Diane Greene, the senior vice president of Google Cloud, the company’s products have undergone a number of changes and fresh launches aimed at appealing to large businesses. Those changes included the new Google Sites that has been built to compete more closely with Microsoft’s SharePoint document management and storage system, and the Springboard service that’s supposed to help employees more easily find files they need. Last year, Greene revealed that the company created a consulting group to help understand the needs of enterprises using its products. The company recently announced that 3 million organizations are paying for G Suite, up from 2 million at the end of 2015. It’s solid progress for Google, but much of that expansion has come from small and medium-size businesses, not massive customers. Peter Yared, the CTO of Sapho, said that G Suite adoption has been largely nonexistent among the companies that his company serves. “Look, we never run into G Suite,” he said. “[It is] for the small part of the [small and medium business] segment.” Sapho sells a service that helps companies connect their disparate—and often outdated—systems of record with one another to help speed up their employees’ work. Its clients are exactly the sort of large enterprises that Google is trying to gain favor with. There are some enterprises that have taken the plunge, however. Telus International, a subsidiary of the Canadian telecommunications company that provides phone support, currently has 25,000 of its employees using G Suite. The company migrated over to Google’s productivity suite four years ago and isn’t looking back, according to CIO Michael Ringman. At the time of the migration, Telus International had several different setups for productivity and collaboration. Working across the company’s offices (some of which exist as a result of acquisitions) while using on-premises versions of Microsoft Office was cumbersome. Although it took work to manage the change from Microsoft’s suite to Google’s, Ringman said that the outcome was positive. “The reality we’ve seen, we’ve seen better collaboration, better communication and frankly had better [employee] engagement,” Ringman said. “We actually measure our engagement scores ... and have seen an increase in our engagement scores somewhat directly as well as indirectly due to our rollout of the Google G Suite.” Businesses build entire workflows around Office products, and they will often use macros to automate some of their work, said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. That entrenched use of specific features can also hinder adoption. “So, for instance, a company will go in and do macros and run their business on a spreadsheet. And that is a factor. I can’t just dial up G Suite and have those macros work,” Moorhead said. “G Suite was born in the cloud, Office 365 was born on the desktop. So if you have things that need to run on the desktop really well like macros, that instantly takes you out of the G Suite camp.” That’s a problem Google’s engineers are working hard to tackle, according to Prabhakar Raghavan, a vice president of engineering at Google. However, he said it’s a challenge because the macros have been built for client software that runs on a user’s computer, rather than a web app. “Our intent is not to move off 100 percent cloud into some sort of hybrid environment, our direction is to remain in the cloud,” he said. “And so the challenge my engineers are hard at work solving is how to provision, entirely in the cloud, the things that people can get from a hybrid environment.” People at Telus International who still need to rely on macros or other dedicated functionality in Microsoft Office can still use the on-premises software that the company still holds licenses for. When employees using Chromebooks need a traditional desktop computer environment, the company uses virtual desktops to compensate.  Still, switching from Office to G Suite involves much more than just getting users to adopt a new user interface. That could prove problematic to businesses, according to David Lavenda, the cofounder of Harmon.ie. His company makes software that helps connect Microsoft Outlook and SharePoint and ease companies’ migrations from Lotus Notes to Office 365. A number of its clients looked at G Suite and ultimately opted to go with Office. There are many components in the institutional use of a particular office suite, Lavenda said. “There’s the support structure behind it, there’s expertise in these organizations knowing how to support these products and knowing where to turn to, and how to fix problems. It’s much more than just getting people to edit documents with a different user interface.” To increase user familiarity with Google’s tools, the company acquired Synergyse last year and has been using its e-learning courses to help people get acquainted with Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Furthermore, the company will send its product managers and engineers to help with deployments of G Suite at large customers. Raghavan said a team will arrive at a customer’s work site on the first day of a major deployment and just walk around to help answer questions. “These are rank-and-file engineers who usually write code,” Raghavan said. “And it’s great both ways because the customer feels well taken care of, through the transition. And for an engineer or a product manager, it’s a great learning [opportunity], because you’re like ‘Oh my God, I never realized that pixel there was confusing.’” But while Google is continuing to gain traction, Microsoft remains the dominant player in the productivity app market. The Redmond-based titan reported last month it has 85 million monthly active commercial users of Office 365. At least in the near term, G Suite and Office 365 are fighting largely for the chance to pick up customers who are migrating off on-premises versions of Office. Gartner’s Mariano pointed out that some enterprises are actually running in hybrid environments where some people are using G Suite and others are using Office. “It’s getting to the point now where enterprises are almost letting them duke it out in real time in the real world,” Mariano said. “Which is an interesting thing. We see that a lot in higher education, where the administrative side might be using Office 365, and the student body might be using G Suite.” Although it still faces challenges, Google has improved its enterprise compatibility, through its continued enhancements for security and compliance capabilities, as well as deploying features in ways that don’t disrupt existing workflows, Moorhead said. “Every year, they’re getting more friendly to the enterprise with their products,” he said. Ringman said Google still has work to do in order to make it possible for Telus International to run its whole business on G Suite. In particular, he called out data sovereignty as a key issue for moving some remaining information into the cloud. Regulations require some Canadian data be stored in-country, and G Suite doesn’t yet allow users to store data there.  Google isn’t slowing down its introduction of enterprise features. The company kicked 2017 off with an announcement of a set of feature upgrades aimed squarely at solving enterprise security concerns. Google expanded its data-loss prevention features to Drive, added S/MIME to Gmail, and allowed administrators to restrict logins to only people with hardware security keys. Google is planning additional enterprise-focused features for G Suite and the other services covered under its Cloud division. The team is hosting a three-day conference in March, which is expected to feature a suite of announcements aimed at driving its enterprise business forward.

Refugee resettlement also resumed. The companies, backing a lawsuit brought against the ban by Washington state, argued that Trump's order created uncertainty for companies depending on talent from overseas and global business travel to innovate and create jobs in the United States.

"Multinational companies will have strong incentives ... to base operations outside the United States or to move or hire employees and make investments abroad." "Ultimately, American workers and the economy will suffer as a result," the companies argued.

In its response to the lawsuit, the government argued in legal filings that the president was exercising his constitutional authority to control US borders and that the law allows him to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners who "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States." The Department of Justice declined to comment beyond the filed court papers. The government had until Monday afternoon (Pacific Standard Time) to submit additional legal briefs to the appeals court in support of the executive order. Following that, the court was expected to act quickly. A decision either way may ultimately result in the case reaching the US Supreme Court. The brief filed by the companies hailed the contributions inclusive immigration policies have made to the American economy. It claimed that immigrants or their children have founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. In addition to some of the companies filing the brief, the attorneys pointed to companies such as Kraft, Ford, General Electric, AT&T, McDonald's, Boeing , and Walt Disney. "Collectively, these companies generate annual revenue of $US4.2 trillion ($5.5 trillion), and employ millions of Americans," the brief said. Susan Cohen an attorney at Mintz Levin in Boston who represents big companies in immigration matters, including global information company and Reuters parent Thomson Reuters, said lawyers were advising clients to get to the United States as quickly as possible because the current situation allowing travel could change. She said that businesses were going out of their way to provide the most up-to-date information to their employees as the fast-moving court battle developed. "Many businesses are extremely upset and confused," Cohen said. "They don't know if meetings will be able to go forward or they will be able to bring people in for work. They can't plan."  Reuters Advertisement HuffPost Australia Government Plans To Slash Youth ... Contains: External link Dick Pratt's Family Donated Way More To ...

Varun Sood Accenture’s clients include Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber and Airbnb which together accounted for at least $1 billion of the IT firm’s $32.9 billion in revenue for the year ended August 2016. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Bengaluru: Indian technology outsourcing companies’ inability to find new customers even as US rival Accenture Plc is managing to do business with firms that dominate the consumer Internet, including Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., again underlines the reason behind the dismal growth of home-grown companies. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber and Airbnb together accounted for at least $1 billion of Accenture’s $32.9 billion in revenue for the year ended August 2016 (Accenture follows a September-August fiscal), said an executive familiar with the development who declined to be named. This is significant because until a few years ago, none of these five firms spent much on technology outsourcing. ALSO READ | The IT industry has an opportunity to shape global forces One reason behind slow growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd is their inability to generate enough business from any of these new-age companies, which are disrupting the business models of many of the Fortune 1000 incumbents (which in turn are customers of Indian technology companies). A strong consulting practice and early investments in new technology areas, like data analytics and design capabilities, eventually helped Accenture offer solutions, swiftly, in what is commonly called microservices architecture. As firms like Google and Uber have been following the microservices model for a few years now, Accenture’s ability to offer solutions using the same approach towards writing code makes it the preferred partner for these firms, said the executive cited above. Microservices can be described as an approach where the underlying code for applications is designed, built and deployed as a simple set of autonomous services. ALSO READ | The next decade for Indian technology venture investing Under microservices offerings, for example, Accenture helps a team at Google working on Google Maps or Google Translate write code using application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs allow two computers or services to “talk” to each other or exchange data. “(Accenture) does not make these client numbers public but these five companies bring in over a $1 billion,” said the executive cited earlier, who declined to share the revenue Accenture gets from each firm, but added: “You should remember that few of these companies were not even born in 2005. So until a few years back, most of them were not even spending much.” “A strong consultancy practice helps because you can scope a deal even before a RFP (request for proposal) is sent. But an even bigger reason is microservices. (Accenture’s) strength in microservices is helping because all these companies, be it Google, Facebook or Uber, have been using microservices architecture,” said a second executive, who also declined to be named. An aggressive acquisition approach also helped Accenture, which does as much business as TCS, Infosys and Wipro put together, report a 6% dollar revenue expansion last year. TCS and Wipro are expected to report at-best 6% and 5% growth in the year ended March, with only Infosys expected to grow a tad faster at 7.4%. “Using APIs, message queues, these microservices are orchestrated and managed. They often come from multiple sets of programming languages, models, frameworks and data stores,” said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “Microservices is similar to the old world of application development and maintenance; however, instead of building a solution in six months, we’re talking six days to six weeks. Microservices involves massive staff augmentation work and, in some cases, priced out as annuity-based projects. Going forward, we will see the work take shape in more AI-driven patterns and models, where AI is used to generate new code based on the patterns and applied to testing and development,” Wang added. An email sent to the five firms on Friday seeking comment remained unanswered. An Accenture spokesman declined to comment on client contribution, and said: “We continue to make significant investments in new and high-growth areas across Accenture—especially digital, cloud and security services, which together now account for more than 40% of total revenues and grew at a very strong double-digit rate in the quarter (September-November).” Varun Sood Topics: Accenture Accenture clients TCS Infosys Wipro More From Livemint READ MORE All finance ministers have perpetual desire for lower rate: Arun Jaitley Gold prices recover by Rs225, silver tops Rs43,000 RBI governor Urjit Patel nudges banks to reduce lending rates First Published: Wed, Feb 08 2017. 03 14 AM IST Editor's Picks Infosys row seen as Narayana Murthy vs Vishal Sikka personality clash Govt appoints directors of 10 IIMs; G.

Waze Carpool completes its Bay Area rollout and adds three new partners Posted Feb 7, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Chatbooks raises $11.5 million to put photo printing on autopilot After expanding to the Bay Area in a pilot last September, Waze Carpool is now officially open to all in the nine counties that make up the region, and also in Northern California from Sacramento to Monterey, the company announced. This marks the proper launch for the Google-owned collaborative ride-sharing tool, which is not so much a competitor for Google as it is a community-focused effort on actually sharing rides to and from work with people who are driving your way already. Waze Carpool also has three new partners in its efforts to help address Bay Area traffic congestion, including the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) and Kaiser Permanente, all of whom will now contribute to carpool routes that serve areas that include San Francisco hospital campuses where bus and other transit routes don’t normally reach. UCSF and Kaiser Permanente are hoping that teaming up with Waze for its carpooling services will help it address the issue of traffic and parking shortages at its Mission Bay, Geary and Parnassus sites, according to the company, and Waze Carpool will now be offered as a part of their existing transportation demand management programs, which seek to drive down the number of single-person cars choking up roadways and available parking. requested-ride-driver-perspective_2 requested-ride-rider-perspective requested-ride-driver-perspective_1  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit As it has been since its pilot debut in 2016, Waze Carpool is not seeking to attract professional drivers. Instead, it’s looking to sign up drivers via its Waze app, and riders via the Waze Rider app, and it provides a minor payout from riders to drivers — but not more than the current average federal mileage rate. The whole payment structure is designed to help drivers recoup the cost of gas, and perhaps a bit of maintenance, but not much more than that. Waze doesn’t vet drivers, as a result, and the intent is literally just to facilitate carpooling through a technical solution, since traditional carpooling often fails because of a lack of sustained interest or too much variety in destinations among small groups of friends and coworkers. New riders get two free rides when they sign up for Waze, and thanks to the partnership, anyone who registers with a UCSF or Kaiser Permanente work email address will also get an additional free ride. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Waze Founded 2007 Overview Waze is a social traffic & navigation app based on the world's largest community of drivers sharing real time road info and contributing to the “common good” out there on the road.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Guest Why mobile app stores are on their way out Jonathan Lister, PensionBee@jayfresh February 7, 2017 3:15 PM Tags: App Store, google play, Jonathan Lister Above: The Google Play Store. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google announced last week an upcoming change to its Android mobile phone operating system that threatens the future of its own mobile app store, Google Play. And the resulting shift is likely to threaten Apple’s App Store, too. It is likely that in 2018 or 2019, we will no longer perceive a difference between a website and a mobile app, and we’ll wonder how Apple and Google ever managed to control the market for mobile apps so completely. The new feature on Android lets users “install” web pages from the Chrome web browser so that, for all practical purposes, they look just like apps downloaded from the Google Play store. This is a significant improvement in a feature that has been available from the earliest days of smartphones  — the iPhone launched in 2007 with the ability to “save to Homescreen,” creating shortcuts for your favorite websites, but it never took off. To pay or not to pay For developers hoping to create native app-like experiences from these “homescreen apps,” there has never been anything like feature-parity between apps downloaded from app stores and those saved from websites. Even when the homescreen apps have been technically adequate for the job, the poor usability around installation and poor visibility on phones has been a barrier to adoption (particularly on Android where a homescreen app doesn’t even make it into the main “apps” menu). So homescreen apps have always been the poor cousin of native apps, making native apps the only viable choice for most companies, despite bold examples like the Financial Times pursuing the homescreen app route since 2011. One of the major stumbling blocks for many businesses adopting homescreen apps has been the lack of integration with Android Pay and Apple Pay, the built-in payment technologies on Android and iOS. These take the pain out of mobile payments by allowing customers to verify an online transaction using their fingerprint, rather than having to type in card details over and over again. Last summer, Apple announced it was integrating Apple Pay into Safari, which would allow creators of ordinary websites to take advantage of the technology. Google made a similar announcement in the autumn. An app by any other name As a customer of a personal finance service, there are some key tasks you’re looking to achieve: track your money, make payments, securely upload and receive documents. For many businesses, the recent integration of Android Pay and Apple Pay into homescreen apps fills a significant gap. Given that mobile is a significant driver of traffic to e-commerce websites, anything that makes it simpler to complete a purchase in the moment will be rapidly rolled out. And with last week’s Google announcement closing the usability gap between native and homescreen apps, app stores will be less important when it comes to rolling out better mobile experiences to our customers. Everyone likes a prediction, so here is mine: The next six months are going to see major brands shifting their attention to developing and releasing mobile web apps and canceling planned updates to their native apps. By the end of 2018, the mainstream consumer mindset will have shifted enough to make the oligopoly of Apple’s App Store and Google Play seem like ancient history.

How exactly do you get started? And can you really move all of your important files over easily? Here's everything you need to know about switching from Mac to Windows. Image: Gizmodo The first point to make is that Windows and macOS are still pretty different operating systems, and you may well hit a few bumps in the road as you make the switch. It's certainly much easier to do for someone who spends all their time in a browser, for example, than someone heavily invested in the likes of Pages and Numbers. With that in mind, it's a good idea to take stock of what you need to move before you get started in earnest. It might be better for you to use your old macOS machine alongside a new Windows 10 device, at least for a while, until you've got the kinks ironed out. We should also note that we're concentrating on the most recent versions of macOS Sierra and Windows 10 for the purposes of this guide, just for the sake of space and simplicity. A lot of the same points will still apply to older versions of the OSes, however, even if the details are different. Photos and videos Image: Screenshot Few things will confuse a veteran Windows user more than a glance at the way macOS and its Photos app arrange pictures and videos on the local drive. Apple's basically wont organise photos in folders — the whole system is proprietary and pretty opaque — which is fine if you love Apple's approach but not so great if you want to switch to Windows. The good news is iCloud for Windows can download all your pictures, assuming you're using iCloud and not just keeping all your photos and videos stored locally on your Mac. You can also download them direct from the iCloud web interface, though it's not the quickest or most elegant of solutions. If you can't use iCloud as a go-between, use the File, Export, and Export Unmodified Original option in Photos on your Mac to get pictures to a FAT32-formatted external hard drive that will work with both macOS and Windows. If you've got thousands of files to move over, you might be waiting a while. Image: Screenshot Instead of paying for an external hard drive, you could pay for some storage space on Google Drive or Dropbox and sync your files over the web instead. The Google Photos uploader for macOS will spot your Photos library straight away, and you can use the Google Drive desktop client for Windows to get everything on your PC. Just make sure there's a Google Photos folder visible in Google Drive, which you can set from the Google Drive settings on the web. In the case of Dropbox, there's not yet integrated support for a macOS Photos library, but you can still export your files to your Dropbox folder, and sync them from there. iTunes, music and movies Image: Screenshot iTunes is on Windows of course, and as soon as you verify your Apple ID credentials, you should be able to download and watch or listen to anything you've purchased through the iTunes Store on your PC. Don't forget to unregister your Mac as one of the machines linked to your Apple ID, if you're getting rid of it. For music and movies you've imported yourself, the process is less straightforward — again you're relying on an external drive or a syncing service, as we talked about above, to get all your files from one place to the other. You can find where your iTunes folder is located by choosing Preferences from the iTunes menu then opening the Advanced tab. Everything you need will be in this folder, as long as you've got the Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library box ticked. Image: Screenshot If you haven't, you need to consolidate your library first. You can do this by choosing File, Library, Organise Library, and then ticking the Consolidate files box. If you've forked out for a Pro account (or you have a small library) then Dropbox can sync your iTunes library from one machine to another, but it's a method only for the brave. You'll need to have all your music and video content in the designated Media folders, and you need to then point iTunes (on Windows) to your newly synced library inside Dropbox by holding down Shift when you launch the program. The benefit is you get all your metadata (such as playlists and play counts) carried over at the same time, but it can get tricky, and you have to remember to keep just one instance of iTunes open at any one time to avoid conflicts. If you want to give it a go, there are guides on the web to lend a hand. Applications and documents Image: Screenshot The web life — making use of apps such as Netflix and Spotify — certainly pays off when it comes to switching from Mac to Windows or back again. The likes of Gmail and Amazon Video and so on will of course work wherever you have access to a web browser. Chrome, Firefox and Opera are available on Windows and macOS, though Apple has pretty much given up on Safari on Windows, so you're going to have to leave it behind. Make sure you've exported any bookmarks you need before you go (if necessary, install Chrome, Firefox, or Opera on your Mac first, copy the bookmarks, then sync with Windows). Given Apple's reluctance to release its software on other platforms, you're going to have to say goodbye to applications like iWork and GarageBand. On Windows you can turn to either LibreOffice or Microsoft Office for your productivity needs, while LMMS is a good (and free) alternative to GarageBand on Windows. Image: Screenshot Earlier, we mentioned doing an audit of your system before you switch, and weighing up which applications you're going to lose access to are an important part of this. While Adobe Photoshop is available on both platforms, for example, smaller but well-loved programs such as Day One or Ulysses aren't. Moving personal documents is pretty straightforward: again, you can use a FAT32-formatted external hard drive or a syncing service like Dropbox to get everything from one machine to another. If you're using iCloud on your Mac, iCloud for Windows will move files from all the key folders open for you. Getting those files open is much more of a challenge. Files from apps like Pages and KeyNote just won't open on a PC, so you really need to save them in compatible formats before you ditch your Mac. If you forget, you can download them in alternative formats (such as PDF and Microsoft Office) from iCloud on the web. Emails, contacts and calendars Image: Screenshot Don't forget your emails and contacts in the move. If you're already on a webmail system like Gmail, you're all set. Alternatively, if you're just using iCloud, you can enter the relevant mailbox settings to get a matching inbox in Outlook or whatever your client is on Windows. If you get iCloud for Windows up and running, and you use Outlook on your Windows machine, then emails, contacts, and calendar information can be synced across for you without too much difficulty. The iCloud email system works via IMAP, which means the same messages appear wherever you've set it up — delete an email in one client, and it disappears from the others too (including web clients like Gmail). Note that if you've set up two-step authentication on your Apple account (and you really should), you'll need to head to the account on the web to create app-specific passwords for your new email clients. Image: Screenshot It's when you've got years of emails in Apple Mail and not in iCloud that you want to take with you that it gets complicated. Mailboxes can be exported from Apple Mail (Mailbox, Export Mailbox), but not in a format that Windows clients can understand. Your best bet might be to try a third-party tool like Emailchemy to run a conversion for you, but you'll usually have to pay. If you don't want to take the iCloud for Windows and Outlook route for your contacts and calendars, you need to take the old-fashioned export and import route: there are export options in both the Contacts app for Mac (File, Export) and iCloud on the web (select all your contacts then click the cog icon and Export vCard). There's no option to export calendars in iCloud on the web but you can do it from the Calendars app on the Mac machine you're about to leave behind: click File then Export then Export again. You'll get an .ics file you can then import into Google Calendar or somewhere else (if you are switching to Google services, this might be helpful). What about my iPhone? Image: Screenshot If you're ditching your Mac and sticking with your iPhone, you'll find Windows isn't quite as friendly but is still prepared to make an effort, thanks to all the Microsoft apps now available for iOS (you can even install Cortana on your iPhone if you want to). In the Windows 10 taskbar search box, type "phone companion" and click the top result that appears. Select iPhone or iPad from the app that appears and Windows will guide you through the process of getting emails, photos, files, and more synced between iPhone and PC, mostly using Microsoft's own apps. For those of you who don't want your hands held quite so much, you can set up all kinds of custom configurations. Simply switching to Google apps (if you haven't already) is a good idea, as all the emails, contacts, and calendars on your phone can then be accessed from any computer with a web browser. Image: Screenshot You can use the likes of Dropbox or Google Photos to sync snaps from your iPhone, though if you want to stick with iCloud you can always use iCloud on the web and iCloud for Windows to manage everything, as we've already mentioned. The only downside is that Apple might not be as keen to keep its Windows software updated as Google is to keep improving its web apps. While Apple has done a lot to improve iOS-macOS integration in recent years, it's still relatively easy to use an iPhone with Windows, not least because iPhones are very much standalone devices these days. If you want to use iTunes syncing and backups, you can of course use the Windows version. There are an almost limitless variety of configurations here — depending on how your Mac is set up and how you want your new Windows machine to work — but we've hopefully given you some useful pointers on the biggest issues you're likely to face. Comments hamish77 @hamish77 Feb 8, 2017, 11:43am The only thing you'll lose is stability. Good luck Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Feb 8, 2017, 1:22pm Ha! I have more issues every day on my MacPro at work than I have on my PC laptop at home in a year. We're still on El Capitan, and it's easily the most stable version I've ever used, but it is nowhere near as robust as Windows 10 on a decently specced PC. It is also much less user-friendly into the bargain, thanks to Apple's wanton removal of features it decides you don't need any more. e.g. In El Capitan, we can no longer play several Tb of stock footage that we've collected over the years, because Quicktime can no longer play anything using its own Animation codec. It can't even transcode it any more. It would be like Microsoft deciding that Windows Media Player woudl no longer be able to play WMV files. i.e. Utter madness.

There are dozens upon dozens of great options on the market today, but finding the best of the best can be a bit difficult. We’ve seen some great launches through the year and more should be coming soon too, so let’s take a look at the best Android smartphones you can buy as of February 2017. We’re heading into release season folks… It’s been a quiet couple of months for smartphone releases, mainly because “release season” is right around the corner. In the next two months or so, we’ll be seeing new flagships from Samsung, LG, Huawei, and more. If you’re in the market for a new device right now, our biggest recommendation is to just wait. If you pick up a phone today, you might end up regretting it later on. Plus, when all these new devices do launch, current generation devices will have already gone down in price. So, unless your heart is set on owning a Google Pixel or Mate 9, or you need a new smartphone immediately, you should probably just give it a few weeks… NEW FOR FEBRUARY: HTC U Ultra (Pre-order) Last month HTC announced two new smartphones, one of which being the flagship-caliber HTC U Ultra. With an impressive glass-on-glass design, a 5.7-inch QHD display, and top-of-line specs, it looks like a solid buy going into 2017. The HTC U Ultra is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64 or 128GB of internal storage, and packs a 3,000 mAh battery. It also offers Android Nougat out of the box with HTC’s custom skin on board. The U Ultra also comes in Brilliant Black, Cosmetic Pink, Ice White, and Sapphire Blue. For many, it could prove a good middle ground between the LG V20 and Galaxy Note 7, but at $750, it isn’t the easiest pill to swallow. Currently, HTC is accepting pre-orders for the device, but it should be available from other retailers shortly after. FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR: Google Pixel/Pixel XL When talking about the best Android phones, there’s no way to avoid talking about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. These two smartphones, designed by Google from the ground up, show off the best that the company has to offer, and it’s impressive. While not perfect, Google’s efforts with the Pixel show just how good Android can be, both in terms of stability, performance, and the overall experience. The Pixel packs top-tier specs including the Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32 or 128GB of storage, and the breathtaking 12.3MP camera on the back. Google’s services are pre-loaded out of the box, the latest version of Android is pushed immediately, and Google Assistant is showcased front and center. Other perks include the 24/7 support, unlimited full resolution photo and video backups, and support for Google’s all new Daydream VR experience. Pricing for the Pixel starts at $649 for the 5-inch variant and $769 for the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Add $100 to either for the 128GB storage tier. Monthly financing is available both through the Google Store and through Verizon Wireless. Huawei Mate 9 (US Release) As expected, Huawei launched the Mate 9 in the US market at CES 2017 for the pretty reasonable price of $599. Packed inside of its gorgeous aluminum design, the Mate 9 has Huawei’s in-house Kirin 960 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a dual-camera system, a 5.9-inch 1080p display, and Android Nougat. Alongside Google’s latest OS, Huawei has also included the latest version of its EMUI software skin, and it’s finally pretty good. The Mate 9 will also be updated in the coming weeks to include Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant in place of the Pixel-locked Google Assistant. We’ll be revisiting the device soon, but in the meantime, you can read our full review here and buy the phone from Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo, Jet.com, or Newegg for $599 unlocked. It works on any GSM carrier including T-Mobile and AT&T. OnePlus 3T Announced toward the end of 2016, the OnePlus 3T is the successor to the OnePlus 3, although it’s really just a slight refresh. Compared to the OnePlus 3 the 3T brings the updated Snapdragon 821 chipset, a larger 3,400 mAh battery, a new color variant, and an updated 16MP front facing camera sensor. Aside from that, the OnePlus 3T is the same as the OnePlus 3, bringing Dash Charge fast charging, a 5.5-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, and USB-C — all wrapped up in that aluminum chassis. Starting at $439, it’s slightly more expensive than the OnePlus 3 was, but not without reason. The phone is available now from OnePlus’ website. LG V20 If you want a big, feature-rich phone that doesn’t explode, the LG V20 might be your best bet. Packing a 5.7-inch Quad HD IPS display, Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,200 mAh removable battery, the V20 is a power user’s phone without question. This is only emphasized with the dual-camera system on the back which can take standard and wide-angle pictures as well as bringing enhanced stabilization in video. Entertainment only gets better with the built-in 32-bit HiFi DAC which makes listening to music a joy. The LG V20 is one of the best smartphones we’ve used this year, but the most surprising thing about it is the price. While a similar option from Samsung, Apple, or Google could cost you well upwards of $800, the V20 averages out at about $770. Pricing varies by carrier, landing at $672 on Verizon at its lowest point and $830 on AT&T and its highest. Monthly pricing across all major carriers lands at around $28 a month and the phone is available via Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Sprint. You can also pick it up unlocked. Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge Samsung also launched a pair of impressive Android flagships last year, and despite their age, they’re still some of the best options on the market today. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge offer Quad HD SuperAMOLED displays at 5.1-inches and 5.5-inches respectively. The larger Edge variant also brings dual-curved edges on either side. Under the hood, both devices pack the Snapdragon 820 chipset in the US, and one from Samsung in international regions. The smaller Galaxy S7 packs a 3,000 mAh battery where the S7 Edge brings a 3,600 mAh battery. Both bring fast charging, wireless charging, and fast wireless charging along with the Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, IP68 water resistance, and fingerprint sensors. The 12MP camera on the rear is also nothing short of impressive and the glass/metal bodies scream premium. Pricing varies depending on carrier and outlet, but you can get these phones from pretty much anywhere between $500 and $700 depending on the model. Moto Z/Moto Z Force From Motorola/Lenovo, one, or rather two, of the best options you can pick up come in the form of the Moto Z and the Moto Z Force. Both devices pack 5.5-inch AMOLED displays, the Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and Motorola’s thin software layer on top of Android. The Moto Z brings a 2,600 mAh battery, 13MP camera, and comes in at just 5.2mm thin. The Moto Z Force, on the other hand, brings a 3,500 mAh battery, 21MP rear camera, and is 7mm thin. It also brings a ‘ShatterShield’ display which won’t break. Unfortunately, that model is exclusive to Verizon Wireless. Both devices run on top of Android Nougat, and lack headphone jacks. However, they do include USB-C adapters in the box. That port also includes Turbo Charging which promises up to 15 hours of power with a 15-minute charge. Both are also compatible with Google’s Daydream VR platform. The big story, though, is without a doubt the compatibility with Moto Mods, a method of expanding the phone’s capabilities with modules such as battery packs, speakers, and even a camera. The Moto Z Force is available on Verizon Wireless as is the Moto Z, but the latter is also available unlocked through outlets like Amazon. Sony Xperia XZ One option we’ve been hesitant to recommend this year due to price is, well, basically anything Sony offers. While they are all fantastic devices, pricing has been extremely high. However, Sony has finally learned its lesson and adjusted prices to make its phones a much better value, and that includes the flagship Sony Xperia XZ. Priced at $649 unlocked, the Xperia XZ offers a Snapdragon 820 chipset, 3GB of RAM, a 23MP camera, IP68 water/dust resistance, and a 5.2-inch 1080p display. It’s not “top-of-the-line” compared to some other options, but with Android Nougat now available and a fantastic overall package, the Xperia XZ is easily the best Sony smartphone you can buy today. It’s available online through Amazon, Best Buy, B&H, and Fry’s. ZTE Axon 7 If you want a flagship experience, but at a slightly lower price point, the ZTE Axon 7 is an option worth considering. Starting at just $399, the Axon 7 packs a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, all-metal design, front facing speakers, and premium specifications including the top of the line Snapdragon 820 chipset. It also packs an insane 6GB of RAM and support for Google Daydream when Android Nougat arrives soon. The ZTE Axon 7 is available for purchase from ZTE, Amazon, and many other retailers around the web for $399 unlocked for use on GSM carriers. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Google and Facebook are to work together in order to stop the circulation of fake news in France during upcoming presidential election. The US search engine and social media site are taking part in CrossCheck, an industry coalition which includes Agence France-Presse, Buzzfeed News, Le Monde and other French media outlets to tackle fake news stories. The nonprofit group First Draft News, of which Google News Lab is a founding partner, will lead the CrossCheck project to help the public make sense of what and who to trust in their social media feeds, web searches and general online news consumption in the coming months. The 17 organisations that make up CrossCheck would identify and verify content circulating publicly online, whether it is photographs, videos, memes, comment threads and news sites, with the French presidential election as its primary focus, the group said. Facebook will provide tools and undertake media literacy efforts to explain the verification process and keep audiences up to date with confirmed and disputed election related data. The project will use several tools and technology platforms including CrowdTangle, a tool that will help early discovery and monitoring of social content that is appropriate to the election; Google Trends to surface searches about candidates and campaign claims in real time. It will also use Meedan’s Check collaborative verification platform and Spike, NewsWhip’s technology to spot and predict breakout stories, social posts and viral events. Hearken’s Engagement Management System will collect and respond to questions submitted by the public. Users will be allowed to submit questions and the initiative will investigate links to disputed sites and social content. CrossCheck brings together expertise from media and technology industries to make sure hoaxes, rumors and false claims are swiftly debunked, and misleading or confusing stories are reported correctly.

He said the seven countries targeted had “significant terrorist presence” or were “safe havens for terrorism”. Trump’s actions were “plainly constitutional”, Flentje argued, as the president sought to strike a balance between welcoming visitors and securing the nation of the risk of terrorism. “The president has struck that balance,” he said. “The district court order upset that balance.” Flentje argued that the district court restraining order was too broad, giving rights to people “who have never been to the United States” and “really needs to be narrowed”. Judge Michelle Friedland, who was appointed by Barack Obama, asked: “Are you arguing then that the president’s decision in the regard is unreviewable?” Flentje replied: “Yes, there are obviously constitutional limitations.” But Judge William Canby, an appointee of Jimmy Carter, pointed out that people from the seven countries already could not come into the country without a visa and were subject to “the usual investigations”. How many of these people had committed terrorist attacks in the US, he wondered, before pointing out it was none. Flentje pointed to Congress’s determination that they were countries of concern, an argument that Judge Richard Clifton, an appointee of George W Bush, dismissed as “pretty abstract”.

The states argued that behind the executive order was potential religious discrimination. Giuliani, in an interview with Fox News last month, said: I’ll tell you the whole history of it. When he first announced it, he said ‘Muslim ban’. He called me up, he said: ‘Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally’ … And what we did was we focused on, instead of religion, danger … The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible. Today in court, those comments were referenced by the judges when questioning DoJ lawyer August Flentje, who had told them: It is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the president’s national security determination based on some newspaper articles. Judge Richard Clifton asked him: You deny the statements attributed to then candidate Trump and to his political advisers and to most recently Mr Giuliani – do you deny those statements were made? … Either those kind of statements were made or they’re not.

The states say the temporary restraining order (TRO) that blocked the travel ban nationwide should remain in place until a court hears the full appeal. Purcell said the burden was on the government to prove that the TRO should be lifted. Purcell said the current hearing was the “wrong remedy” and the government should make its case back in the district court in Washington state. He argued that the government had shown no “irreparable harm” from keeping the TRO in place, but that several harms had already been demonstrated in the period the travel ban was in effect: Families were separated. Longtime residents were unable to travel overseas. There is lost tax revenue. The court should “look behind” the executive order for the motivation, Purcell argued, saying it amounted to discrimination on religious grounds. Judge Richard Clifton pressed him on this, pointing out that not all Muslims were affected by the block on the seven countries: My quick pencilling suggests it’s something less than 15%. Purcell said the states did not need to prove the travel ban hurts every Muslim, but that the intent behind it was to discriminate against Muslims. The ban, he said: was done to favour one religious group over another … The president [as a candidate] called for a complete ban on the entry of Muslims. He said it was still unclear how many citizens of the two states were directly affected by the travel ban, or whether people from the seven countries on the list who were now lawful residents of the US were or were not restricted by it. Purcell insisted the TRO was not too broad and questioned what the government meant when it said it could adopt a narrower implementation of the travel ban: They have not credibly described how they would be able to do that, even if it would address all of our harms. Updated at 8.01pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.37pm EST 19:37 Government case: a summary August Flentje – a longtime justice department lawyer but apparently last-minute appointment for this hearing – made the case on behalf of the federal government. He asked the judges for a stay on the temporary restraining order placed on Trump’s travel ban by district court judge James Robart last week. This would reinstate the restrictions on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and on refugee entries until a full appeal against the travel ban is heard. The district judge was wrong to override the president’s judgment on national security, Flenje argued. Judge Michelle Friedland asked if that meant the president’s decision is not reviewable. Flentje: Yes. Does that mean if the president were to introduce a Muslim ban via executive order on the grounds of national security, that too could not be reviewed, Friedland asked repeatedly. Flentje: That’s not what the order is. He said the executive order was not discriminatory on religious grounds and said the judges should not rely on “newspaper reports” of the alleged motivations behind the travel ban, which he called: very troubling second-guessing. Flentje said the executive order was an “extension” of the visa requirements placed on visitors from the seven countries, which have been determined to pose a risk of terrorism. Pressed by Judge William Canby on how many people on those visas had committed terror attacks in the US (Canby then answered his own question: none), Flentje said the legal proceedings were “moving pretty fast”. To pushback from the judges, Flentje said the states could not challenge visa denials or revocations as a third party. He said the states lacked “a legally protected interest” in the case. Flentje argued that the district court restraining order was too broad, giving rights to people “who have never been to the United States” and “really needs to be narrowed”.

Tom McCarthy Even if the states lose the appeals court ruling, the case may not head directly to the supreme court. The states may decide to continue litigating the case in the district court, seeking a slightly different type of relief from the restraining order granted by Judge Robart. The states could seek a preliminary injunction, which would also have the effect of suspending Trump’s executive order in the near term. If the appeals court rules in favor of the states, the justice department may appeal to the supreme court, may hold off on an appeal until the supreme court landscape changes, or may mount a challenge in a different district court, or take as yet unforeseen action.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.10pm EST 19:10 Flentje says the scope of the restraining order “really needs to be narrowed” to apply only to residents of the states. But, says Clifton, isn’t it only the president who can amend the executive order? How can the court narrow it? Shouldn’t that be the job of the executive to clarify what it means? Flentje says the definitive interpretation of the order comes from White House counsel, who speaks for the president: At most, the injunction should be limited to … previously admitted aliens who are abroad now and wish to return to the US.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.05pm EST 19:05 Flentje gets another run – rebuttal and also because Purcell went a little over his alloted time. He says the document of the executive order itself “is the best evidence of the intent of the president”, which he argues is national security. He says it is based on “countries of concern”. Friedland harks back to her earlier question: if the alleged intent were to ban Muslims, is the ban really not subject to review? That’s not the order we have here, says Flentje, harking back to his earlier answer. Shouldn’t the case should proceed to discovery to find out if that was the motivation, Friedland asks. Flentje calls that “very troubling second-guessing” of Trump’s decision. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.02pm EST 19:02 Purcell: The court can review this order. The court should review this order.

Judge Clifton points out that previous orders have discriminated on the basis of nationality, for example Cubans: There hasn’t been a challenge to that. Purcell says such cases were “much narrower”. Clifton says foreign policy treats people from different countries differently “all the time”. We treat people from North Korea differently to people from France, the judge says.

Like it has with several other technologies and services in recent months, Google is pulling the plug on its Hands Free mobile payment application. In a brief announcement this week, the company said it would shut down the service Feb 8. After that date, Hands Free will no longer work in the small number of San Francisco Bay Area retail stores that have accepted Hands Free payments on a trial basis since Google announced the service last March. Google's statement offered no reason for the company's decision to terminate Hands Free and merely noted the company had learned quite a bit from the pilot program. Microsoft released its mobile Outlook client for iOS and Android two years ago this week, based on the software giant's late-2014 acquisition of the popular email app, Acompli. To celebrate, the company announced add-in support for the iOS version of the app. The first batch includes Evernote, GIPHY, Nimble, Smartsheet, Trello and Microsoft's own Dynamics 365 and Translator. In addition to serving as the cloud-based version of the software giant's user identity management platform, Azure AD also can be used to provide single sign-on and access services for a variety of third-party software-as-a-service apps and Microsoft's own Office 365 business software suite. Add-in functionality is being rolled out first to Office 365 customers, followed by Outlook.com users. The Tenant Restrictions feature in Azure Active Directory is now generally available, allowing organizations to exert more control over their users' interactions with software-as-a-service applications to prevent leaks of sensitive information. Azure AD also can be used to provide single sign-on and access services for a variety of third-party apps and Microsoft's own Office 365 business software suite. Essentially, the feature can be used to help businesses ensure that their users are only permitted to log into their cloud application subscriptions. "For example, you can use Tenant Restrictions to allow access to your organization's Office 365 applications, while preventing access to other organizations' instances of these same applications," continued Simons. The vast majority of successful attacks on companies are conducted by cyber-criminals using phishing, network scans for exploitable systems and strategic web site compromises, security-services firm SecureWorks found in an analysis of six months of incident-response engagements. The analysis of 163 incidents found that 82 percent could be attributed to cyber-criminals, 11 percent to insiders and 7 percent to nation-state adversaries. The company attributed attacks to financially-motivated cyber-criminals if they included theft of funds, the copying of financial information or personal data, the use of computing power, or ransom of data. While advanced attacks and zero-day vulnerabilities garner a lot of attention, phishing, exploitation of known vulnerabilities and using websites to launch attacks were the most common methods of compromise. The vast majority—88 percent—of attacks were opportunistic and not targeted, the report stated.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

A federal court in Philadelphia has ruled that Google must comply with an FBI demand for certain customer data that are currently stored on Google servers located overseas. The data belongs to targets in two separate domestic criminal investigations. The account holders are U.S residents and the crimes in question happened solely within the U.S. as well. Google has so far refused to hand over the requested documents citing a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a similar dispute involving Microsoft. Like Google, Microsoft had refused to comply with a court order asking it to provide the government with data that happened to be stored in one of the company's servers in Ireland. In that case, the appellate court had ruled in favor of Microsoft and said the company should not be forced to produce data stored overseas, because doing so would amount to an extra-territorial application of U.S. laws. Google had pointed to that decision as a precedent for why it shouldn't be compelled to produce customer data stored overseas either. Google claimed that the federal Stored Communications Act (SCA), which the government had based its search warrant on, only covers data stored within the United States. The company noted that it had already produced all responsive data it could find stored on its domestic systems. Google also claimed that the order requiring it to provide the data was overly broad and did not specify what services exactly the government wanted Google to search for and produce. In a 29-page ruling Friday, U.S. magistrate judge Thomas Rueter disagreed with the Second Circuit court's reasoning and held that Google must indeed produce the requested documents regardless of where they are stored. "In contrast to the decision in Microsoft, this court holds that the disclosure by Google of the electronic data relevant to the warrants at issue here constitutes neither a "seizure" nor a "search" of the targets' data in a foreign country," the judge wrote. A court order issued under the SCA is really a hybrid between a search warrant and a subpoena. Serving it does not involve government agents having to enter a service provider's property, search its servers and seize data. Rather it is executed like a subpoena that requires the recipient to hand over the requested data regardless of where it is located. The mere act of electronically transferring data from a server outside the U.S. to Google's systems in California does not constitute a search or seizure of property. As part of delivering its services, Google regularly transfers user data between data centers, including those located outside the country, without the customer’s knowledge. Often such transfers take place automatically and as frequently as needed to keep Google's services running optimally. In these circumstances especially, "electronically transferring data from a server in a foreign country to Google's data center in California does not amount to a 'seizure'," Judge Rueter said. "There is no meaningful interference with the account holder's possessory interest in the user data." In a statement, Google said it would fight the ruling. "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision," the company said. "We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants." There's a lot at stake for Google and other American companies in these cases. Following Edward Snowden's leaks, there has been a lot of concern, especially overseas about the U.S. government's access to customer data stored by U.S. cloud providers. Google and others have said they only provide data when compelled to do so by court order and have vowed to protect customer data to the extent they can, including in court where necessary.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Cisco to Produce Azure Stack Hybrid Cloud Systems Google Launches Mobile Live Streaming Support for YouTube Microsoft to Shield Azure Cloud Customers From Patent Troll Lawsuits Federal Court Says Google Must Turn Over Data In Foreign Servers EU Certifies Google Data Transfer Contracts Comply With Privacy Rules                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

Image: screenshot: Google brain By Raymond Wong2017-02-07 22:32:23 UTC You see it all the time in movies and TV shows: A security camera records footage of an intruder, but the image is too blurry or pixelated to make out who it is. Some nerdy-looking "hacker" then clacks at his keyboard and — boom — seconds later, pixelated image turns into a crisp one revealing the person's face in glorious detail.  "Oh, come on!" we all say while rolling our eyes. Well, you might have to break that habit because Google has figured out a way to turn movie magic into reality (sort of). SEE ALSO: Google's biggest Android problem is also ruining emoji According to ArsTechnica, researchers at Google's deep learning research project, Google Brain, have created software that attempts to "sharpen" images made up of 8 x 8 pixels.  Of course, Google Brain's software can't actually enhance the original block of pixels. Instead, what it's doing is using machine learning to try to guess what the original image might be if it had been downsized to 64 pixels. Google Brain's software does this with two stages of neural network training. The first stage involves a "conditioning network" that cross references the 8 x 8 pixelated image with similar-looking images that are higher resolution and then downsized, checking for patterns and colors, as you can see below: Image: screenshot: google brain The second stage, called the "prior network" then uses details from high-resolution images to try to fill out the low-resolution images. Finally, the images produced from both neural network training sessions are then composited together to create the best approximation of what the original image might be. Google Brains' software isn't technically "zoom and enhance" magic, but according to the researchers' findings, it comes damn close and the "enhanced" images are good enough to fool most people.  Squint hard and you might think the "hallucinations" (Google Brain generated images based on the training) are enhanced versions of the low-res images, too. They could have fooled me.

The Linaro Digital Home Group (LHG) has released a sample build of the Android TV version of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) distribution for Linaro’s 96Boards Consumer Edition spec. The firmware is initially available on the 2GB RAM version of the LeMaker-built, community-backed HiKey SBC, the official Android reference board for 96Boards. The release follows up on Linaro’s Mar. 2016 release of the mainstream AOSP for the 64-bit, ARMv8 HiKey. Although the build targets the CE-compliant HiKey, it will eventually migrate to the 96Boards Enterprise Edition TV Platform spec. The TV spec was first tapped by HiSilicon’s Poplar Board. Linaro’s AOSP TV for 96Boards architecture (click image to enlarge) The AOSP TV build integrates TV-focused components such as the TV Input Framework and Leanback APIs used in Google’s Android TV platform, the successor to Google TV. The release enables easier development of Android TV apps, and lets vendors and hackers build Android TV compatible devices without having to go through Google’s verification process. With this independent, fully open source build, vendors do not need to include Google-licensed Google Mobile Services (GMS). Furthermore, they are not subject to requirements such as complying with the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), the Compatibility Definition Document (CDD), “and stringent audio/video performance criteria,” says Linaro. AOSP’s TV Input Framework (architecture (click image to enlarge) Android TV’s TV Input Framework (TIF) enables live TV streaming with the help of components like TV Input Manager, TV App, and TV Input HAL. TIF abstracts the input source from the user, permitting easier viewing of content from a variety of sources such as cable, satellite, terrestrial, and IP-based media delivery. Sample inputs screen in AOSP TV for 96Boards, demonstrating TIF juggling of input sources (click image to enlarge) The Leanback APIs adjust Android for the “10-foot” experience of TV media and game interaction. Leanback APIs provide a “model-view-presenter” approach, in which models can be “anything extending Object in Java.” The view is handled by the existing android.view package, and the presenter is based on Android’s Adapter concept. Linaro’s HiKey AOSP TV build provides code for integrating Android TV’s Live TV app, and integrates a sample Android TV Channel Service. The stack also includes support for Adaptive Bit Rate Streaming. HiKey The 85 x 54mm HiKey SBC, which was originally built by CircuitCo for 96Boards.org, is now manufactured by LeMaker. The board runs Linux or Android on a HiSilicon Kirin 6220 SoC with 8x, 1.2GHz Cortex-A53 cores and a Mali 450-MP4 GPU. Features include WiFi, Bluetooth, HDMI, MIPI-DSI, and three USB ports, as well as the 96Boards standard 40-pin low-speed and 60-pin high-speed expansion connectors.   Further information The Linaro Digital Home Group’s sample build for AOSP TV on HiKey is available now for download. More information may be found on the AOSP TV release page and download page. Linaro will demonstrate AOSP TV for 96Boards at Linaro Connect Budapest 2017 in Hungary on Mar. 6-10.   Related posts: 96Boards SBC gains AOSP build from Linaro Two 96Boards SBCs debut, including one with AMD's ARM… Quad-core, Cortex-A53 hacker SBC runs Linux and Android First "96Boards EE" SBC debuts with AMD ARM SoC Linaro beams LITE at Internet of Things devices Next-gen TV STB platform runs Android on quad-core… Tiny SBC runs Android and Linux on Snapdragon 410 96Boards.org goes Cortex-M4 with IoT Edition and Carbon SBC Linaro launches open ARM SBC spec, and an octa-core SBC 96Boards-like SBC offers wireless and Ethernet (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Internet Services by Sean Hollister February 7, 2017 12:44 PM PST @starfire2258 This, my friends, this glorious TV and movie trope, may be coming true. The ability to "zoom and enhance" an image, one that's far too low-res for humans to understand, is now way, way closer thanks to a team of AI researchers at Google. Behold: Enlarge Image Google At left, the crummy low-res image the computer had to work with. At right, the actual photo. And in the center... a human that bears a passing resemblance to the real photo! Enlarge Image The four rightmost columns show how the same low-res image can be interpreted in very different ways. Google So, how did it do that? Google's Brain research team trained a pair of neural networks to do it all by themselves, by feeding them images of celebrity faces (and for a later test, bedrooms). One network was responsible for figuring out how the pixels might turn into a higher-res image, while the second added fine details, each network working with what it "knew" about celebrities (or bedrooms) having analyzed lots of similar pictures. No, it's not remotely close enough to identify an exact person -- and remember, the computer is imagining the details, not magically extracting them. Still, it could be another tool (like a police artist's sketch) to help detectives ID their suspect. Perhaps it could help agencies get more value out of satellite images, too. And it looks like it could work with source material that's far lower-res than the Boston Marathon Bombing footage from 2013 -- where Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab demonstrated a similar "super resolution" technique. Unfortunately, a Google rep tells us this was a "one-off research exploration," and has no current plans to use it. It's also probably worth noting that Google's computers knew that they were looking at faces (or bedrooms) to begin with. You can read much, much more about precisely how the Google technique works (and how it fooled 11 percent of humans, which Google's researchers claim is a remarkably high number) in the PDF document below.

Crunch Network Trump’s first weeks in office have politicized the tech industry Posted Feb 7, 2017 by Jake Bright (@JakeRBright) 0 SHARES Next Story You don’t need a subwoofer for your wrist Jake Bright Crunch Network Contributor Jake Bright is a writer and author in New York City. He is co-author of The Next Africa. More posts by this contributor: Mastercard launches 2KUZE agtech platform in East Africa 2016 Africa roundup: drone delivery, VC, unicorns, exits and Zuck How to join the network Earlier this week more than 100 companies — including Apple, Facebook and Google — filed an amicus brief challenging the constitutionality of President Trump’s January 27 immigration action, Executive Order 13769. The move comes after days of heated rhetoric and protests in Silicon Valley over the new administration’s statements and policies. Contrary to any business-as-usual atmosphere, President Trump has thrown the tech industry into turmoil. Confusion, friction, obstruction Though some upsides to Trump’s IT policy may emerge, a lack of internal structure in the White House is adding to the uncertainty that began on the campaign trail. The president’s tech agenda is largely a blank slate. During the election, candidate Trump issued no major tech policy briefs, gave no major IT speeches and generally only talked about tech to hammer Apple or Amazon on jobs. His transition team and White House communications office did not respond to multiple requests to discuss tech policy priorities or appointments for this story. The White House Office of Science and Technology’s website is down and only one (known) White House staff tech adviser — Trump family friend Reed Cordish — has been named. During the election, candidate Trump issued no major tech policy briefs, gave no major IT speeches and generally only talked about tech to hammer Apple or Amazon on jobs. The administration’s first tech-related policy initiative, an executive order on cybersecurity, first faced big questions, then was scrapped. After an acrimonious campaign relationship with the technology sector, the play-nice period fostered by Trump’s December 15 Tech CEO Summit has definitely waned. Discord between the White House and Silicon Valley is already factoring on several fronts. At the CEO level, industry leaders are verbally, legally and organizationally clashing with Trump’s policies. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned from Trump’s business advisory board over the travel ban. Before this week’s en masse industry challenge, Microsoft and Amazon had already filed a federal lawsuit against the executive order. Google announced a $4 million fund to help those affected by Trump’s immigration orders. And in anticipation of administration restrictions on the H-1B visa program, some tech co-founders established an industry contingency plan — True North — to relocate their foreign workers to Canada. There’s also the increasing possibility of frequent protests and flat-out obstruction by tech leaders and workers against Trump administration policies, some of which may already be in play. There is a lack of clarity regarding Trump’s technology policies. Most campaigns lay out specifics on a whole range of issues. The fact that he didn’t concerned me.— Steve Case, CEO of Revolution LLC Last week, Google employees worldwide staged walkouts over the travel ban. IT workers — some affiliated with a new Tech Solidarity group — also recently protested in front of Palantir on fears the Peter Thiel co-founded company could assist a Muslim registry. And on the extreme end, the Calexit movement for California secession — elevated by venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar — cleared administrative hurdles to become a ballot initiative in 2019. In the meantime, pressure on industry executives to weigh in against the travel ban is mounting. Elon Musk — who was also named to Trump’s business advisory board with Uber’s Kalanick — is facing calls to step down. Though not part of the original grouping, his companies Tesla and SpaceX joined the list of firms backing the amicus brief lawsuit against Executive Order 13769. Cabinet, management style, potential upsides For all the current distress around Trump and tech, there could be some policy upsides down the road. Steve Case, the internet pioneer and co-founder of the Washington-based tech investment firm Revolution LLC, saw a mixed bag in the wake of the inauguration. “There is a lack of clarity regarding Trump’s technology policies. Most campaigns lay out specifics on a whole range of issues. The fact that he didn’t concerned me,” he said. “But now that he won, that lack of clarity could create greater opportunity to influence the policies.” These early opinions from Case, made in the first days after the election, have shifted with the President’s performance in his first weeks in office. “Now that we are seeing President Trump’s initial policies, I certainly have concerns. Like many in the tech community, I am strongly against the executive order on immigration,” Case wrote in an email. Outside of the policy realm, Case also thinks Trump’s election win — which was driven by a surge in rural and rust-belt support — could “serve as a wake-up call” for Silicon Valley to widen its perspective, “be more sensitive to the broader societal impact of technology,” and “lead to greater investment” in more regions of the country. Steve Case, chief executive officer of Revolution LLC and co-founder of America Online Inc. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images While it’s hard to determine the new administration’s tech agenda, Consumer Technology Association CEO Gary Shapiro  believes industry benefits could come through Trump’s other policy priorities. “If there’s an infrastructure bill, there’s a possibility to include broadband, to build smart highways with fiber underneath. These are bi-partisan things and I don’t think Trump is going to disagree on them,” he said. Shapiro also sees tech opportunities in Trump’s trade policies: “Redoing NAFTA could be a good thing. It was negotiated in 1993, it hasn’t dealt with intellectual property, it hasn’t dealt with the internet, it hasn’t dealt with data flows.” Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, points to possible industry benefits from Trump’s tax repatriation plan. “We’d like to see that money trapped overseas come back…to strengthen the American economy and our companies,” he said. Guardino also believes tech policy under a Trump administration could be positive if the president lets his appointees lead. Beyond the White House, there are multiple executive agencies and commissions — from the FAA and FCC to The Department of Labor — that regulate the tech industry. “It will be interesting to see his style with his cabinet members. Will he follow more of a CEO ‘I hired you because you’re smart, go’ model, offering independence?” Guardino said. “If that’s the case, for example, with someone as competent and capable as Transportation Secretary Chao — whose agency will co-regulate drone delivery and self-driving cars — then we have great hopes. If his style is more micromanagement, then it will be more challenging.” Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Donald J.

The decision seemed to be at odds with Microsoft's successful appeal last month in a cloud data privacy case that, like Google's case, was based on a warrant for data stored outside the U.S., under the Stored Communications Act. Google argued that some of the requested data could not be legally disclosed because it was stored overseas, but the company disclosed some of the data requested by the FBI under warrants in two separate criminal cases. U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, ruled in favor of the government in this case. "The disclosure by Google of the electronic data relevant to the warrants at issue here constitutes neither a 'seizure' nor a 'search' of the targets' data in a foreign country," he wrote. In the decision, Rueter explained: "Electronically transferring data from a server in a foreign country to Google's data center in California does not amount to a 'seizure' because there is no meaningful interference with the account holder's possessory interest in the user data." Although some or all of the data may have been held outside the U.S., Rueter noted Google's admission that it routinely moves customer data without the customer's permission -- and may not even be able to definitively state where specific customer data is stored at any given time. "Google contends that it does not currently have the capability, for all of its services, to determine the location of the data and produce that data to a human user at any particular point in time," Rueter wrote. "The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision," Google stated through a spokesperson. "We will continue to push back on overbroad warrants." Google argued that the cloud data privacy case involving Microsoft should apply to Google, as well. In that case, Microsoft resisted a search warrant issued in December 2013 demanding the email of an unnamed suspected drug dealer that was stored in a data center in Ireland. Last year, Google was one of a number of organizations, including Apple, Amazon, Cisco, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, Delta, Eli Lilly, BP America, The Washington Post, Fox News, the National Newspaper Association and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, that filed amicus briefs in the cloud data privacy case, in which a three-judge panel for the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals decided in Microsoft's favor. That ruling, asserting the government's warrant could not be used to compel Microsoft to turn over customers' emails stored outside the U.S., was affirmed last month when the circuit court rejected the government's appeal.

However, Google has already promised that many more Android Wear 2.0 watches are coming this year from its partners. The latest company to join this fray is ZTE, according to a new leak. The Chinese smartphone maker is allegedly working on its first smartwatch to run Android Wear, which will be called ZTE Quartz and is pictured below. The ZTE Quartz is said to come with Wi-Fi as well as 3G connectivity, allowing for data access when it's not paired to a smartphone as well as taking calls on your wrist. It will have the model number ZW10, but other details about its specs have not surfaced yet unfortunately. This might mean that while it is in development, we're not very close to its release at the moment. Or maybe ZTE just has a better ability to keep such secrets compared to its competitors. It's thus impossible to tell if we should expect the Quartz to be unveiled at MWC in Barcelona at the end of this month, but we'll be there and will bring you all the details if that does in fact happen.

To forestall a repeat of what happened in last November’s US election, the social media behemoth is introducing a fake news filter. Facebook, however, is not in this alone, Google too is pulling resources together to ensure a hitch-free election [regards the quality of news] is held in the European country. The Facebook and Google initiatives will be rolled out in form of tools aimed at curbing or slowing down the spread of online misinformation. With the tools, both tech giant will be able to flag false news articles for readers, reports WSJ. A nonprofit group being financed by Google, First Draft News, said on Monday that it has engaged the services of 15 French news outlets, including Le Monde and Agence France-Presse to help verify content circulating online in the run up to the presidential election scheduled to hold in April. Prior to last November’s US election, Google added a ‘Fact Check’ label to its news service, Google News. Articles containing fact checks are determined by Google’s algorithm using the schema.org ClaimReview system. The algorithm will also look for sites/blogs that adhere to commonly laid down criteria for fact checks. The social media is awash with all sorts of fake news, and is giving a lot of people much to ponder about. Facebook in particular is battling hard to deal with fake news in its popular News Feed. Its Trending section for instance, has become a place where loads of unsubstantiated news emanate from, and is giving the social media behemoth a lot of worries. On Facebook’s part however, the social media giant is rolling out similar tools it announced would be used for the forthcoming elections in Germany. The fake news filter will tag such news stories as “disputed” and accord them lesser priority on users’ news feeds when reputable news organizations flag them as false. German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently alerted her country’s parliament to the dangers of fake news and bots, and how they can influence this year’s election. In a speech to the parliament shortly after declaring her intention to contest the coming election, Merkel said fake news and bots have “manipulated” public opinion online. She therefore urged the lawmakers to “confront this phenomenon and if necessary, regulate it.” “Something has changed — as globalization has marched on, [political] debate is taking place in a completely new media environment. Opinions aren’t formed the way they were 25 years ago,” Merkel said. “Today we have fake sites, bots, trolls — things that regenerate themselves, reinforcing opinions with certain algorithms and we have to learn to deal with them,” per AFP. Facebook users in Germany will now be able to report suspected fake news stories. Such stories will then be sent to the Berlin-based media non-profit Correctiv. Articles deemed to false or fake will then be marked as “disputed,” followed by an explanation of how Correctiv came about the decision. On its part, Facebook will then follow up with warnings to users before they share a fake news story. Warnings by Facebook will appear in the lower end of the News Feed where it will not be able to get the kind maximum publicity like other credible stories.

PSFK Op-Eds 7 february 2017 In 2016, some of the biggest tech companies, like Google and Microsoft, announced advanced messaging platforms that changed the messaging landscape. Google Allo, focused largely on consumer use, features the Google Assistant to help users with everything from getting directions to finding movie times, all within the chat interface. Microsoft Teams, positioned as a Slack competitor, includes integrations with Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, allowing simple collaboration for teams working on projects, presentations or proposals to enhance productivity. Google and Microsoft aren’t alone. Many other organizations, like Facebook, are amping up their messaging platforms with robust features. And that effort isn’t without reason—three in 10 adults and 36 percent of smartphone owners use messaging apps. The main thread between the two examples mentioned above and others on the market is that these platforms provide users with much more than a simple chat interface or communication channel. Rather, they look to function as productivity tools as part of a messaging ecosystem that encompasses a wider variety of services and capabilities. While some may argue that messaging exploded in 2016, the reality is that new tools and features were only introduced and messaging platforms barely scraped the surface of their full capabilities. 2017 is when the full extent of messaging services will be realized and pushed into practice. Chatbots Will Be Integral to Messaging Services Since chatbots in 2016 were not as reliable as promised, that is now a huge focus for the upcoming year. An example is Microsoft’s own chatbot, Tay, who was one of the first chatbots with an artificial intelligence architecture to make its way into the wide consumer domain. Tay didn’t have a specific purpose, but rather was meant to function as any other human. Unfortunately, the data collection, which is what allows Tay to learn and improve, encouraged Tay to become an unruly, and some would argue, offensive chatbot. Since then, Microsoft has removed Tay and announced a commitment to continuing research and development in artificial intelligence. So while chatbots didn’t reach human intelligence in 2016, they did successfully prove their worth as helpful assistants. For example, NetSfere, an enterprise-grade messaging service, introduced its own chatbot, Net-C, which encourages engagement from its users by prompting them of new features or updates. This pushes users to better utilize and learn about the various components of a platform and take advantage of all its services. Others, like Google Assistant, are starting out with a simple infrastructure, focusing on tasks like finding restaurants or playing an emoji-based trivia game. However, in 2017, chatbots will begin to advance and become more reliable, even being able to assist in booking travel or planning meetings. This is due to the amount of trial and error conducted in 2016, including advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning that will allow these chatbots to become smarter. Thanks to this exploration, there is a much better understanding of chatbots’ current capabilities and full potential. For enterprises, specifically, chatbots integrated with messaging platforms will become invaluable in helping to improve productivity and even collaboration. For consumers, they will be wildly helpful in functioning as a personal assistant to help improve our social lives by helping to make plans or even improve our health by providing us with helpful reminders, tips and advice about everything from our diets to exercise regimen.   Security Will Improve Cybersecurity was top of mind in 2016, from the huge DDoS attack that occurred in October to Apple’s encryption battle with the FBI. These situations and others exposed many of the vulnerabilities and uncertainties associated with new technologies, particularly as we begin to rely more on connected technologies.   While not directly correlated to messaging services, these cybersecurity threats forced many to reevaluate existing security measures, namely those related to our virtual lives. Sharing personally identifiable information online is necessary for booking travel or purchasing a product, and for messaging platforms and chatbots that want to assist with this process, security is a number one concern. However, most messaging platforms were not initially made with that level of security in mind. In 2017, messaging platforms will come under intense scrutiny for their security measures, particularly as we begin to rely on them more, thanks to the progression of chatbots and their increasing applications.   Applications Will Grow Consumers and businesses will start to use messaging in new ways in the coming year. Beyond just as a customer service solution, retailers will use it to let customers make purchases. You may even be able to quickly chat with a physician and order a prescription without stepping a foot into a doctor’s office. Additionally, we will see an increasing number of integrations and partnerships like those featured on Microsoft Teams. As these integrations grow, messaging platforms and services will quickly become a hub where users can do much more than chat with a friend, but can get the news, order an Uber or check-in to a hotel. These types of applications will explode in 2017 as chatbots and security simultaneously improve, enabling messaging platforms to truly become integral to our lives. While 2016 laid the groundwork for messaging platforms to reach their full potential, 2017 will be the year these announcements prove their worth through practice. Through a combination of increased security, the adoption of chatbots and advanced applications, 2017 will provided users the opportunity to realize messaging’s fully potential.  Anurag Lal is the President & CEO of Infinite Convergence Solutions.

Name: Subject: Message: 5 great Google Now Launcher alternatives Apps & Games Features Newsby Jimmy Westenberg3 days ago 20 804 39 Google is putting the kibosh on one of its best apps. Originally available on the Nexus 5 running Android 4.4. KitKat, Google brought the Google Now Launcher to the Play Store way back in February 2014. This was great news for folks who wanted a Google-y software experience on their non-Nexus Android phones. Now, three years later, the company has decided to part ways with the Now Launcher. Though upsetting for some people, the news isn’t incredibly surprising; Google’s new Pixel and Pixel XL came with an all-new launcher (the aptly-named Pixel Launcher), and it’s even available in the Play Store. While non-Pixel users aren’t able to download the new launcher directly from the Play Store, the app does work on other phones if you don’t mind sideloading it. It’s not all bad news, though. If you already have the Now Launcher installed on your device, you’ll still be able to use it once it’s gone from the Play Store in April. Just don’t expect any major updates to come to the launcher anytime soon. So if you’re on the lookout for a simple, clean and customizable launcher for your Android device, we’ve got you covered. Here’s a list of five great Google Now Launcher alternatives. Don't miss: Best Android launcher apps 6 days ago Action Launcher 3 Let’s start off with my personal favorite, Action Launcher. This one has been a long-time favorite of the Android Authority team and its readers, and that’s for good reason. Action Launcher is one of the most customizable, unique launchers available in the Play Store. So what makes it so special? Developer Chris Lacy has done a great job at bringing the look and feel of the new Pixel Launcher to this app, adding in some convenient features that make this launcher truly special. One of the most standout features of Action Launcher is Quicktheme, which allows you to theme your search bar, folders, and app drawers with the colors of your current wallpaper. The Covers feature lets you place an app of your choosing at the forefront of a folder, allowing you to gain quick access to your favorite apps while still taking advantage of folders on your home screen. Action Launcher’s Quickbar lets you customize the look and feel of your Google search bar widget, and the Shutters feature lets you quickly gain access to an app’s widget with a simple swipe. The developer is constantly releasing stable, frequent updates to the launcher too. Be sure to follow Chris Lacy on Google+ for news about updates. Get it from Google Play Nova Launcher If you’re looking for the most customizable Android launcher in the Play Store, you should definitely check out Nova Launcher. Nova Launcher has been around for years, and it just keeps getting better. It features support for different icon packs, subgrid positioning on your home screen, a scrollable dock, widgets support in the dock, plenty of gestures, unread count badges, custom icon swipes, and a ton of other features. It also comes with a handy Night Mode option that allows you to automatically apply a dark theme to your search bar, app drawer, drawer icon and folders when the sun sets. Oh, and it’s fast, too. Once you install this app and enable the “Nova” scroll speed, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Just like Action Launcher, Nova Launcher receives a steady stream of big updates every month or so. For the most customizable experience around, you’ll definitely want to check this one out. Get it from Google Play ASAP Launcher If you’re looking for something completely different from the other options on our list, ASAP Launcher might be for you. It doesn’t give you the same ol’ home screen layout other third-party launchers offer by default. Instead, ASAP Launcher aims to give you the most information it can, spread out over five home screens. The first screen (pictured above) features a large search widget on the top, which gives you a quick glance at the weather and the music that’s currently playing on your device. A simple swipe up on the row of icons on the bottom of the screen will bring up a grid of your most-used applications, too. The other four home screens give you quick access to your contacts, weather information, calendar and upcoming events, as well as a detailed to-do list. You can also swipe in from the right side to pull up a quick settings menu. There are tons of themes to choose from too, including a Day/Night theme, as well as a theme based on your current wallpaper. ASAP Launcher isn’t the most customizable launcher out there, but it’s definitely worth trying out. You can download it for free in the Google Play Store. Get it from Google Play Evie Launcher Evie Launcher is by far the simplest launcher on this list. This launcher sort of flew under the radar when it was released in 2016, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a viable option. In fact, Evie Launcher has made a name for itself for its simplicity and customizability throughout the past year. The Evie Launcher home screen is clean and easy to navigate. You’ll find a search bar at the top that can be quickly accessed by a swipe down anywhere on the home screen. This will allow you to search through your apps and contacts list, and even look up information on restaurants, movies, TV shows and more. And once you find what you’re looking for, you can simply press and hold that search result to add the shortcut to your home screen. It also uses a Pixel Launcher-style app drawer, features a “no dock” mode, and the ability to change the grid size on your home screen. The best part? Evie Launcher is free in the Google Play Store, which certainly helped the app make its way to our best Android apps of 2016 list. Get it from Google Play ADW Launcher 2 ADW Launcher has been around for years, but the app received a major overhaul back in June 2016. And when I say overhaul, I mean it. Pretty much every aspect of this launcher has been rebuilt from the ground up. It’s been designed with Google’s Material Design guidelines in mind, features tons of customization options, plenty of unique widgets, and even the ability to create your own custom widget within the app. Some of the latest features that have been added to ADW Launcher are a new Dynamic UI coloring theme, support for Android 7.1 launcher shortcuts, a new “wrap folder mode” (similar to Action Launcher’s Covers) and more. You really need to download this one for yourself to see all the customization options available here. ADW Launcher 2 is available in the Play Store for free, with a one-time in-app purchase to upgrade to the Premium version for $3.49. Get it from Google Play So, that’s our list of Google Now Launcher alternatives. Do you have any others you’d like to add? If so, be sure to speak up in the comments below!

So Safer Internet Day is observed each year and is dedicated to the spread of awareness on the risks of being online. The theme from this year is ‘Unite for a better internet’ and in keeping with the theme, tech giants from all around the world have come together to ensure that the internet becomes a safe haven, especially for children. Whether by releasing new and safer features for their websites to just spreading awareness, these companies are doing their bit to make the internet a secure place. Google Google has stressed the importance of simplifying and amplifying the ways people can stay safe online. It says that it is constantly working on systems and tools such as spam detection and Safe Browsing. The company has developed the ‘app analyzer,’ which is a modified version of Safe Browsing and is specifically designed to hunt for dangerous apps in Google Play and other app stores.  Sunita Mohanty, Director, Trust and Safety, Google India said, “Google remains committed to providing all users a safe online experience, and help make the broader web of sites and apps more secure as well. We’re constantly improving our automatic protections, but we also want to make sure our users are empowered with the controls to adjust their security settings to ensure a safe experience. A big thank you to all the young people who shared with us their brilliant ideas and campaigns and helped us in our endeavor to make the web a safer place.” The company has also urged users to take a quick Security Checkup and review and manage their Google Account’s security settings. You can take the checkup yourself by clicking here. Facebook Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world and is used by young and old alike. In the spirit of this year’s theme, Facebook India has thanked its partners, UNICEF India, Centre for Social Research (CSR) India, Learning Links Foundation, Breakthrough India and Youth Ki Awaaz. It has also promoted its safety page, which can be visited by clicking here. The page gives users access to information, resources and tools regarding personal safety on Facebook, including information of cyberbullying.  The company states on the page, “People come to Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of others and connect with friends and family. Our mission is to give people the power to share and to make the world more open and connected. We want everyone to feel safe when using Facebook.” Microsoft On Safer Internet Day, Microsoft released its findings of a survey conducted through its Digital Civility Index. The index was created with the aim of making people understand the need to treat everyone with dignity and respect. The survey was conducted through 14 countries and polled teens (13-17) and adults (18-74) asking them about their experiences and encounters with 17 different online risks across four categories. These included behavioral, reputational, sexual, and personal/intrusive. The findings revealed that 63% of Indian respondents said that they have been exposed to an online risk, while 44% of Indian experienced their most recent online risk within the past month. Further, the youth were more confident in managing uncivil behaviour and were more knowledgeable in knowing where to get help. However, only 50% of the youth and 35% of adults actually knew where to get help. You can read the complete report by clicking here.  “On Safer Internet Day, Microsoft is using the Digital Civility Index to amplify awareness and demonstrate the need to further educate young adults, parents, educators, and policymakers about the real-world consequences of negative online interactions, which can have serious consequences. We hope these findings will serve as an evidentiary base for a global drive toward digital civility and increase accountability among internet users,” said Madhu Khatri, Associate General Counsel, Microsoft India. Telenor Telecom operator, Telenor also released the findings of its survey of parents and adults on digital bullying affecting youth. The survey was conducted over Facebook and targeted users between the ages of 18 and 64 who had stated an interest in parenting, family issues, child welfare and online security. It also revealed that 99% of school going children in urban areas are using internet, out of which every second child feels unsafe online. Further, over 35% said that the have experienced hacking of their account, while 15.74% said that they have received inappropriate messages  Cyberbullying was a major part of Telenor’s survey and revealed that 46% of respondents said that they speak to their children all the time about internet and online behavior, while 39% said that they discussed it sometimes. Hostile, rude comments, and online profanity were the most common form of cyberbullying that the respondent’s children had experienced. Further, those children who played online games reported a higher rate of cyberbullying attacks. “In the lead up to Safer Internet Day, we conducted this digital survey to keep on the pulse of the ever-evolving arena of digital bullying, to see how it affects children in Asia, and what both adults and children can do about it,” says Zainab Hussain Siddiqui, Director, Social Responsibility, Telenor Group. “Encouragingly, across Asia, we see examples of awareness-building efforts – on the part of our company and many others – reaching scores of children, parents and school teachers. And we hope this is leading to more resilience against online mistreatment.” Cisco Cisco has released an Annual Cybersecurity Report and that has revealed that even companies need to be safe on the internet. The report revealed that in 2016, over one-third of organisations experienced a breach leading to a substantial customer opportunity and revenue loss of more than 20%. However, 90% of these organizations are improving threat defense technologies and processes after attacks. The report also noted that hacking became more ‘corporate’ in 2016. While attackers continue to use time-tested methods, they also employ new approaches that mirror the “middle management” structure of their corporate targets. However, it was also noted that there was a drop in the use of large exploits like Angler, Nuclear and Neutrino. Shrey Pacheco  shrey.pacheco@digit.in Writer, gamer, and hater of public transport.

Otto wins Hot New Startup at the Crunchies Posted Feb 6, 2017 by Matt Burns (@mjburnsy) 0 SHARES Next Story Twilio’s Jeff Lawson wins the Crunchie for Founder of the Year Otto, winner of the hot new startup award at the 10th Annual Crunchies Awards, had a whirlwind year. The company came out of stealth in May 2016, revealing its plan to develop self-driving technology for semi-trucks. In August Uber purchased the company and all-star team to help expand its autonomous efforts. Then in October an Otto-powered truck made its first delivery, hauling 50,000 Budweiser cans from Fort Collins, Colo., to Colorado Springs. The company was co-founded by former Google engineers. Anthony Levandowski and Don Burnette worked on Google’s self-driving effort. Lior Ron was head of product at Google Maps and Clair Delaunay worked as a robotics program lead. Other engineers at Otto have worked at Tesla, Apple and Google. According to Bloomberg, Uber doesn’t want to dismantle this team of 91 employees, so Levandowski will lead Uber’s self-driving project, and the existing Otto office in San Francisco will become an Uber R&D center. Otto focuses on self-driving technology that could be fitted into trucks that are already on the road now. In other words, Otto doesn’t want to develop its own self-driving vehicles — the startup chose to focus on some sort of self-driving kit instead. Otto makes its own LIDAR sensors. This fits perfectly into Uber’s strategy as the company doesn’t want to become a car manufacturer. Instead, Uber has been looking at partnerships with existing car manufacturers, such as Volvo, in order to turn their cars into self-driving cars using Uber’s proprietary technology. So get ready for Uber’s self-driving kit. Otto previously announced that it intends for its technology to enter the long-haul freight business in 2017 and if its 2016 is any indication, the company has the velocity to do much more. Highlights from the 10th Annual Crunchies Awards 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Otto Founded 2016 Overview Otto is an autonomous startup focused on the development of self-driving technology for trucks. The company works on technology that enables drivers to let their truck steer by itself on certain parts of the highway. Otto also provides solutions that can be fitted onto trucks, thus supporting drivers to have safer journeys, take small naps, and even have lunch while the vehicle is self-steering.

This is great for longer-term investors who don't like to look at daily market gyrations, but it is obviously frustrating for the short-term traders out there. Of course, in this environment patience is absolutely required and traders shouldn't force a position. 1. Volatility: The US volatility index ('VIX') at 11.35 per cent really tells you so much about how the market views future volatility, but then we can also look out at forward VIX futures contracts and see the 'curve' is about as flat as we will ever see.

(This video was produced in commercial partnership between Fairfax Media and IG Markets) The fact is implied volatility is super low and traders don't see much to derail that at present. 2. Oil: The story of the overnight session has been the move lower in oil. Some focus has been on an update from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), detailing they see US output averaging 9.53 million barrels a day next year, up from 9.3 million forecast in its January report and this would be the highest levels since the 1970's. This marries nicely with the US rig count, which has gained some 80 per cent since May as shale gas firms bring back production on-line as price moves through their breakeven levels. We should also be cognisant of the fact that US crude futures holdings by managed money have never been more bullish on the barrel, with a net long position of 380,000 futures contracts. Clearly, a position adjustment from a very crowded trade is in play. The wash-up here then is the balance of power is leaning to the idea that despite output cuts from OPEC (and select non-OPEC nations) price is starting to roll over as supply increases relative to demand.

Inflation effect: Technically, the 10th January low at $US51.59 (on US crude) seems key here as a break takes oil to $US45 in my opinion. Of course, if this move materialises the impact will be felt not just on oil stocks, but inflation expectations too, although we can still see US five-year inflation expectations still just holding the 2 per cent level. 4. Spotlight on miners: The moves in oil should impact BHP negatively today, with its ADR down 1.2 per cent. Bulk commodities look more upbeat though, with iron ore and steel futures offsetting the moves in oil, gaining 2 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. Spot iron ore gained 3.3 per cent, but was playing catch-up to yesterday's moves in the futures market. All eyes Rio Tinto who report full-year earnings at 17:00 AEDT, with the market looking for underlying NPAT of $US4.75 billion, on revenue of $US34.33 billion. Advertisement 5. ASX: The broader ASX 200 looks set for an open around 5627, with SPI futures unchanged. We can see the bulls really stepping in the support price in the Aussie futures market yesterday and traders didn't want the price to close below the key 5550 area I have been focusing on. A higher high today in price and we could be looking at the Aussie futures market really driving the ASX 200 (cash) market higher, with the ASX 200 potentially testing the 5660 area where we saw good supply in late January. The four-hour chart is probably the time frame worth focusing on here. Aussie banks should open on a flat note, while WPL looks set to open down less than 1 per cent (based on the ADR). 6. Paging Dr Lowe: With the dust settling on yesterday's RBA meeting the focus clearly shifts to Dr Lowe's speech in Sydney tomorrow night (20:00 aedt) and then Fridays Statement on Monetary Policy (SoMP), where the view is we are going to see some fairly brutal cuts to the banks GDP forecasts for end-2016 and June 2017. The wash-up of yesterday's RBA statement though is the market has priced in a slightly higher degree of tightening, with eight basis points (bp) of hikes priced in over the coming 12 months (this stood at 4bp just before the release). 7. Currencies: The AUD/USD has traded in a range of $US0.7681 to $US0.7606 on the session and currently sits mid-way through this range at present. GBP/AUD has been the bigger mover on the session though, with the GBP having a fairly constructive day after Bank of England member Forbes talked up the prospect of rate hikes – let's not get too excited though about the BoE lifting interest rates, as the market is market is still only pricing in 11bp of tightening over the coming 12 months and are not pricing in a hike for 19 months. We can also add the headlines that UK PM Theresa May will visit China later this year, although this came out just after the rally in GBP had started. 8.

Coren & Ananya Bhattacharya February 07, 2017 Googlers would prefer that refugees don't go home. (Twitter) Share Written by Michael J. Coren & Ananya Bhattacharya February 07, 2017 Political frustrations in Silicon Valley are boiling over. Protests and walkouts have erupted on Bay Area campuses ranging from Google to Palantir and while management is often in attendance—Google CEO Sundar Pichai and co-founder Sergey Brin have both participated in demonstrations—tech employees are leading the charge. The groups behind tech’s Trump backlash are barely older than the policies they’re combating: The president’s executive order on immigration is only two weeks old, and most of the anti-Trump activity is being organized by outfits that were started only a few months ago. But already, these groups have funneled tech employees’ frustration with Trump into actionable ideas. “We’re a huge industry,” says Optimizely software engineer Brad Taylor, whose Facebook post urging tech workers to organize went viral in late January, leading to the formation of Tech Against Trump. “If we can unify together as an industry, it will be a lot harder for Donald trump to ignore us.” Taylor took to Facebook to suggest a massive tech-employee walkout on March 14; the rallying cry was quickly picked up by supporters that included Nest product lead Mark Rose. As of Feb. 7, more than 1,2000 had RSVPd yes on Facebook. Other grassroots groups, like Tech Solidarity, are also getting in on the action. Silicon Valley’s frustration has also played out at individual companies. On Jan. 30, more than 2,000 of Google’s 60,000 employees staged a walkout to protest Trump’s temporary travel ban. Facebook’s employees have committed to flying less or not at all for the 90-day period that the ban encompasses. On Jan. 18, tech workers rallied outside Palantir, a government contractor co-founded by PayPal founder and Trump advisor Peter Thiel.

In an email to employees, Kalanick wrote that “joining the [council] was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.” Other tech companies have been more discreetly supportive. Cable provider Comcast, for instance, did not issue a public response to Trump’s executive order, but it did continue to pay the 1,200-plus Philadelphia Comcast employees who spent their work hours protesting the order on Feb. 2. Comcast workers in Washington, DC, and Sunnyvale, California, also walked out.

At least 98 companies have now signed a legal brief opposing Trump’s travel ban, among them Apple, Google, eBay, Facebook, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix, Salesforce, Twitter, and Uber. In their brief, the companies argue that “the problems that render the Executive Order harmful to businesses and their employees also make it unlawful.” Valerie Aurora, a former Intel engineer and activist in Silicon Valley, says the building momentum will be “impossible for tech companies’ management to walk back.” CEOs reactions, both public and private, to further Trump administration declarations will be closely scrutinized by both employees and the public at large. “It feel like the tipping point was last week,”Aurora says. “I’m sad that it took this direct threat to the business models for direct management to act, but the workers were already there.” Most Popular Three signals that Donald Trump isn’t going to renegotiate NAFTA Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Feb 7, 2017, 4:10pm EST share tweet Linkedin Waze, the navigation app owned by Google, announced today that the carpooling service it launched last year is now available in the nine counties that comprise the Bay Area, as well as Sacramento and Monterey. That means that a growing number of Californians can use Waze, an app with 75 million active users, to locate strangers to fill the empty seats in their cars on their way to work. To be sure, what Waze is offering differs greatly from Uber and Lyft’s respective carpooling services. Drivers are paired with riders with nearly identical commutes based on home and work addresses. Waze Carpool riders are charged a maximum rate of 54 cents per mile, the current IRS reimbursement rate for business travel by car. And drivers and riders are limited to two rides a day. This is not a money making service, but rather an attempt by Google to test the waters in the growing ride-sharing market. Waze + Waymo = Uber killer? Where this gets super interesting is when you start to think about Google’s ongoing work on self-driving cars and all that could mean for the future of transportation. Could Google combine Waze with its autonomous vehicle spinoff Waymo to launch a self-driving carpool service to compete with Uber? The patents that Google has been filing seem to suggest as much. If Waze's carpooling service is successful and expands to other cities, it's not difficult to see Google using it as a platform on which to launch a fully commercialized, on-demand driverless car service. With no drivers to pay commission, any micro-fare paid by riders goes straight to Google. Or it could sputter and fail miserably because who uses Waze to arrange taxi rides? It took Uber almost six years of nasty, debilitating fights with taxi owners and city governments to get where it is today. And there’s no reason to assume Google can just waltz into this space, start offering a carpooling service, and successfully knock Uber off its perch. Sean O’Kane But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. In addition to expanding its service boundaries, Waze also announced a partnership with three major Bay Area organizations — the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the University of California-San Francisco, and Kaiser Permanente — to minimize parking and traffic congestion. Those organizations will encourage their respective employees to use Waze to carpool to and from work. Still, the process of arranging a ride isn't easy: it takes two different apps. Select employees interested in hitching a ride through Waze can use the new rider app to find a driver. Meanwhile, drivers use the regular Waze app to find riders. Carpooling may be all the rage among tech companies, but its far from a sure bet. UberPool and Lyft Line are continuing to grow into new cities, but Lyft’s experiment with “casual carpooling” in San Francisco ended abruptly after the ride-hail company failed to find enough drivers willing to invite strangers into their cars. Professional Uber and Lyft drivers tend to hate carpooling, as it generally forces them to do more work for less money. And while carpooling is touted as a more environmentally friendly alternative to normal ride-hailing or ride-sharing, it certainly can’t beat the greenest way to travel: good old public transportation.

In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76,324. For all its visceral dislike of Donald Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his programme. Lulled by favourable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent. No longer. After President Trump’s January 27 executive order restricting immigration, high-tech has gone full-tilt political. Companies are being pushed by their employees, by their customers and sometimes by their ideals. They are trying to go far enough without going too far. Nearly 130 companies, most of them in the technology field, filed an amicus brief late Sunday in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which declined to reinstate the travel ban after a lower court blocked it. The brief, which was signed by an unusually broad coalition of large and small tech companies that included Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Uber and Intel, said Trump’s order “violates the immigration laws and the Constitution.” “Silicon Valley is stepping up,” said Sam Altman, who runs the valley’s most prominent startup incubator, Y Combinator. “The companies are working on three fronts: they are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behaviour, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don’t support.” It is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of US brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable — not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind. Many of the companies initially placed their bets on engagement after an upbeat meeting with the president-elect in December. That modest approach, which even the most risk-averse executive can endorse, showed its limits last week. After widespread customer defections, Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber, was forced to step down from one of the administration’s advisory councils. “People voted with their feet, and Travis listened,” said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. “We need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.” Resistance, McClure said, begins at home. “You don’t have a voice with the president if you didn’t vote for him,” he said. “But employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.” Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses. Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. “It’s not like you have 60% of the employees on one side and 40% on the other,” said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “They all have the same leanings.” Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google’s former slogan “Don’t be evil” is the most forceful expression of this. “If you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,” Shotts said. Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order “misguided and a fundamental step backwards,” and saying it would create “much collateral damage to the country’s reputation and values.” At an all-hands meeting at the beginning of the week with the chief executive, Satya Nadella, who was born in India, Microsoft employees expressed their concern. The company did not file a formal declaration supporting Washington state’s effort to block the order the way Amazon and Expedia did, but its public comments assisted the effort, Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said. The immigration battle is in Microsoft’s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said. Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there. “In 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarise ourselves to extreme levels,” said Altman of Y Combinator. “The most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarise the nation.” Tech summit Perhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up. Maciej Ceglowski, the organiser, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified. It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fundraiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travellers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software. “I’ve actually been pretty obsessed with CRMs lately,” said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man startup Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now a US citizen. Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude on issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Oregon; New York; Seattle; Boston and other cities.   Tweet Go to Top Videos 'PM Modi likes peeping into others' bathroom':...

Image Credit: Screenshot Russian search engine operator Yandex today announced the launch of a machine intelligence and research (MIR) group. The move brings Yandex more in line with Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo, which have employed researchers to explore artificial intelligence (AI). To lead the new organization Yandex has selected Misha Bilenko, who spent a decade at Microsoft, most recently as head of the machine learning algorithms team in Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise unit. Before that, Bilenko was a researcher in Microsoft Research’s machine learning department. Bilenko is now based in Moscow, where Yandex is headquartered. While Baidu, Google, and Microsoft have their own open source frameworks for deep learning, a popular type of artificial intelligence (AI) — Baidu has Paddle, Google has TensorFlow, Microsoft has CNTK — Yandex boasts something called DaNet, whose team will be part of the new MIR group, according to a corporate blog post. Teams focusing on computer vision, speech recognition, and machine translation will also join the new group, Yandex said. “From speech-to-speech translation to virtual assistants that chat with people and use cameras to see, the MIR division offers amazing opportunities for synthesis and cross-pollination within Yandex’s machine learning, computer vision, speech and translation technologies. By bringing team members from these core technologies together, the MIR division will improve Yandex’s machine and natural processing capabilities, enhancing its products and services and ultimately delivering consumers and businesses a better experience,” Yandex said in the blog post. Google, which operates the Google Research and DeepMind organizations, recently established a Cloud Machine Learning group led by Fei-Fei Li and Jia Li. Microsoft recently formed the AI and Research Group that includes Microsoft Research. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Over the past several months, the team has been working on using these neural networks to enhance images, and now, it has been able to bring the infamous “zoom and enhance” abilities from sci-fi to reality… This sort of thing is straight out of your run-of-the-mill sci-fi or cop TV show where the protagonist asks the lab tech to zoom way into a photo and then “enhance” it. While this isn’t as crystal clear as the fake stuff is in the television shows, Google Brain is capable of taking an 8×8 pixelated image and “add” details that would have been impossible to see before. This is all possible thanks to the help of two neural networks called the conditioning and prior networks. The conditioning network uses Google’s massive database and tries to match the 8×8 pixelated photo to other photographs that it can find. Using the neural network, Google Brain shrinks images down to 8×8 photos and attempts to map the original item to others from the internet. The second neural network, prior network, uses something called PixelCNN to guess and add pixels to the original 8×8 pixelated mess. Google Brain can reliably determine what pixels to add after it has analyzed millions of other high-resolution photographs with similar details in them. So in this case, the program would look at photos of people’s faces and then when enlarging the original 8×8 image, it can determine what pixels to add based on similarities it shares with the photos it investigated. This slideshow requires JavaScript. As Ars Technica notes, the added pixels are obviously not actually real. The Google Brain program did not somehow “bring back” missing pixels. All of the added details are a part of something called “hallucinations” which is just a term for the pixels that were added by the guesses made by the computer program. The future of the work being done by Google Brain is still unknown but there may be a day in the not-so-distant-future where your real-life police department is zooming and enhancing an image of something that was originally too blurry to make out.

Show More Hey Google: Has it really been three full months since Google Home came into the world? I'll answer that (since Google Home couldn't -- I tried): Yes! Yes, it has. That funny little air-freshener-shaped doohickey first entered our lives this past November. And while I had plenty of doubts about the need for and effectiveness of such an apparatus, I decided it was my professional obligation to pick one up and put it in our house. (Side note: That's more or less exactly what I told my wife when justifying the purchase. Take note, my fellow tech enthusiasts.) The truth is that you can ponder this stuff endlessly from a theoretical perspective, but until you've used it in the real world -- over an extended period of time -- it's impossible to understand how it actually fits into your day-to-day life. [ To comment on this story, visit JR's Google+ page. ] So here we are -- my family, three months into being a Google Home, erm, home. And here's what I've learned about Google's ambitious artificial-intelligence-for-everyone effort: First: Google Home is definitely fun. Sure, you can accomplish most of the same things by speaking to your smartphone, but there's something almost -- dare I say -- magical about calling out a command into thin air and having a voice from beyond respond with results (regardless of who's doing the talking or where your phone might be tucked away). Pretty much without exception, every visitor to our home who's witnessed me say something like "Hey Google, play the Beatles upstairs" or "Hey Google, turn the lights on bright" has been wowed. "Whoa!" "Cool!" "That's awesome!" "What else can it do?" These are all phrases we've heard many, many times now. Even old Android tricks like asking the answer to some random trivia question (remember, anything Google knows, Home knows) are somehow more impressive when anyone can speak them out into the open and get a friendly-sounding answer booming right back. Google Home is also often frustrating. For all of its wonder, Google Home can be a real pain in the arse. These sorts of systems never seem to work as well in the real world as they do in closely controlled demos, and Home is no exception. To wit: A fair amount of the time, Google Home doesn't understand what we want it to do -- even with basic commands like music playback. The other day, for instance, I told it to play a jazz album in my personal Google Play Music collection called "Duo." Telling Home to play a particular album usually works without a hitch. But in this case, it started to play some random other music (I still haven't figured out what, exactly, but I'm pretty sure it involved at least four bagpipes and the voice of Gilbert Gottfried). I told it to stop and tried getting more specific: "Play Charlie Hunter Duo." No problem, it responded -- and then started playing a mix of random songs by Charlie Hunter from Google Play Music. You'd think the fact that there's an album in my personal music collection called "Duo," by Charlie Hunter, would clue it into the fact that that's what I wanted -- especially since that's the only album in my library with that name. But after three or four failed attempts at trying to get it to recognize that, I gave up, found my phone, and just started streaming the damn thing manually on my own. This is but one example of the infuriating side of using Google Home. For all of its alleged conversational prowess, there are still plenty of times when it just doesn't recognize what you want -- either because it's unable to do what you're asking or because you aren't asking in the right way (which often comes down to a guessing game on your behalf). Even with something as simple as inquiring about the weather, we've run into instances where we haven't phrased our questions quite right and Google Home has told us it doesn't know how to help. The fact that the Google Assistant -- the heart of Home -- is wildly inconsistent across different Google products doesn't make things any easier. Communication challenges aside, Google Home presents some irksome technical challenges. Sometimes, the device will activate itself and start talking either as the result of something said on the TV or for no apparent reason whatsoever. (Unintended side effect: Our toddler has learned the phrase "Hey Google, hush!" and occasionally walks around saying that with a fair amount of sass.) Sometimes, one or more Android phones will activate themselves and start listening when you're trying to talk to Google Home. We've started using "Hey Google" instead of "OK, Google" when we're talking to Home as a result -- since the latter also works on phones, while the former does not -- but even with that, the phrases are similar enough that a phone will occasionally pick up on what's being said and chime in. Sometimes, Google Home itself will get confused and start doing weird things. We ended up getting a second Home device and now have one in our kitchen as well as in our dining room/living room area. In theory, the two are supposed to work together and avoid responding at the same time. (The same is true for Home and Android phones.) And most of the time, that works. But -- just like with the phones -- here and there, the devices get disoriented. One will respond to a query while the other says something strange about not knowing how to help or not being able to connect at the moment. I've had to restart one or both of the devices on multiple occasions to get them back in sync, which is an annoying added bit of complexity to have in our house. Home is actually useful -- for some things. More than anything, my wife and I have both come to rely on Google Home for music playback. (Based on what I've heard from other Home owners, that seems to be a common top-use scenario.) We have a handful of Chromecast Audio-enabled speakers around our house, so it's really handy to be able to play practically any music in any room -- or skip a song, adjust the volume, and so on -- simply by speaking a command. Similarly, when we have family members over watching our toddler, they know they can put on music without having to mess with a phone or figure out anything complicated. (Our audio setup makes perfect sense to me, but I realize it's pretty complex and unordinary to most normal people.) Outside of music control, I'd say our biggest use of Home is -- prepare yourselves -- checking the weather. It sounds trivial, I know, but as we're grabbing jackets and rounding up the little one, there's something nice about calling out "Hey Google, what's the temperature outside right now?" and getting a quick update. We have a few Philips Hue lights in our living room, too, and being able to control those by speaking is also pretty useful. That aside, we'll use Home for the occasional on-the-fly info-check -- like asking if a particular store is open yet when our little girl decides to get up at 6 a.m. and we're scrambling to find something to do -- or for setting a hands-free, phone-independent timer to remind us of something going on in the kitchen. Google Home is great for kids -- as well as us children at heart. Okay -- I've been holding back a little. If I'm being fully honest, the commands our Home devices probably hear more than any others are "Hey Google, what does a kitty say?" and "Hey Google, what does a train sound like?" I'm well aware of how insanely silly that must sound to any non-parent. But our daughter is just delighted by having access to those sounds on such a simple and on-demand basis. She walks around saying "Hey guh-gull twain" or "Guh-gul kitty meow" (which is somehow both adorable and disconcerting at the same time). She dances whenever the train sound comes on. She's even managed to activate Home by herself a few times, though it doesn't usually understand her whole command. As for me? I may be slightly older than two, but Home's potential for silliness is not above my maturity level. For a while, I programmed Home to respond to questions like "Who's the smelliest person here right now?" with my wife's name. (As you can imagine, that went over incredibly well.) I also bewildered my brother by having Home respond with the full name of everyone in the house, including him, when I asked it "Who's in the house right now?" one afternoon. ("Wait -- what? Is it because our phones are here? Or does it somehow recognize our voices?!") And to my daughter's delight, asking Home "Who the best little girl in the world?" now results in her name being said back three times. (Here's the trick to that sort of custom Home programming, by the way, in case you're similarly child-minded and want to give it a whirl.) Silly? Sure. But the young and immature among us get a real kick out of it. Google Home is very much a multiperson gadget that revolves around a single person's data. Remember those concerns I raised a while back about Home's single-account conundrum? As it turns out, some of them are spot-on. Home doesn't have the ability to identify different users in any way, so everything said to our Home device is connected to my own personal Google account and becomes part of my own personal Google history. That could have some interesting implications down the line, to say the least. Beyond that, unless I turn off the "personal results" permission entirely, anyone talking to our Home can pretty easily pull up info like my recent purchases and upcoming calendar appointments. Some of the more advanced functions we were expecting to see in Home -- like being able to read emails and add new calendar events or reminders -- are not yet present. Right now, Home responds to such requests by saying it can't handle those items yet, though, so we'll have to see how things progress over time. All in all, Home is more of a neat toy than a necessity. You know what? Skeptical as I was going in, we've really come to appreciate and enjoy having Google Home in our home. It's fun, it's useful, and it feels fantastically futuristic -- at least, when it actually works and doesn't make us mad. I could see Home being even more useful if you had more connected hardware in your house, like a Nest thermostat (which we presently do not). It's the epitome of laziness, I know, but it'd be pretty darn cool -- both literally and figuratively -- to be able to call out "Hey Google, turn the thermostat down a few degrees" without raising a finger or getting up from the couch. And that gets at the core reality of Home: It's hard to argue that it's something most people truly need. Depending on your habits and the specifics of your house, it probably falls somewhere between being a novelty and being a neat toy. But it isn't a necessity, nor is it something I'd say will change your life in any dramatic or particularly meaningful way. For us, I think it lands right smack dab in the middle of the "novelty" and "neat toy" line. We definitely use Home less now than we did early on, when everything about it just seemed so irresistibly futuristic. It's still fun to see visitors react in that awestruck way -- but for us, it's evolved into a tool that's sometimes useful for making certain tasks a teensy bit more convenient (in a very "First World problem" sort of way). Beyond that, the Home device is also a surprisingly good speaker. We ended up taking an old standalone speaker (repurposed with Chromecast Audio) out of our kitchen and moving it into another room because music played through the Home actually sounded better. If you need a Cast-enabled wireless speaker somewhere in your house, $129 for this is a no-brainer. As for the Assistant part of the equation, I'd say it's the kind of thing that'd make a fun present (whether from someone else or just a present to yourself). You'll enjoy using it, and you'll probably get some genuine value out of having it. You'll probably also find yourself annoyed with it from time to time. And if you had to give it up, you might miss it for a little while -- but you'd probably have no trouble adjusting back to your old standalone-assistant-free lifestyle. Right now, artificial intelligence isn't quite the revolution we've been promised. Google Home is, however, a neat toy and a nice added convenience -- not to mention a sensible addition to any wireless Cast-based music setup -- as long as you don't mind dealing with its sometimes not-so-smart-seeming quirks.

(Pt. 1) By Barney Sherman • Feb 6, 2017 Related Program:  Classical music with Barney Sherman TweetShareGoogle+Email In 2007, I read that the "dispute about classical recording is whether it is dying or dead," but in 2016 it seemed as frisky as kids swarming a playground. So many albums came out that trying to winnow them to a "best-of-the-year" list could make you empathize with an Ivy League admissions officer. Yet the challenge didn't daunt hundreds of critics worldwide, and their choices were fascinating. In recent years I've been aggregating all the lists I could find into a "meta-list," and I wasn't ready to stop just yet, so ... welcome to IPR's 2016 Classical Mega-Meta-List! This year it aggregates 70 lists. Many had multiple contributors, for a total of well over 400. They came from 27 countries, almost twice as many as when the Meta-List project started, because Google Translate made it easy to access sources outside the Anglosphere. Google let me add lists in Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Japanese, Polish, Romanian, Spanish, and Swedish to dozens in English from as far away as Israel.  Three years are too few to show long-term trends, but they suggest baselines and may even tell us something about the industry in the mid-2010s. Could it be that the mega-meta-lists give a sense of the classical recording “long tail?" That's Chris Anderson's term for our cultural shift "away from a focus on a relatively small number of hits" and "toward a huge number of niches," and it explains how the top-rated TV shows of 2017 get renewed with fewer viewers than "flops" canceled 20 years ago. It may also soften media's tendency to funnel attention to "superstars." That kind of funneling did happen in this year's meta-list  - the top fifth of picks won half of all the votes, and the top 5% won a third of them - but it's nothing new. What really grew in 2016 was the tail. Over 600 new classical releases struck somebody somewhere as belonging on a best-of-year list, and two-thirds of those picks received only one vote. And while no more releases than last year made 10+ lists, far more received four or five votes. That threshold was reached by 28 CDs last year, but 41 this time. The longer tail could be an artifact of the wider range of countries surveyed, but that's all right with me, since classical recording is genuinely international in the digital age. And I do feel comfortable saying that an industry that produced 600 best-of-year candidates is not acting moribund. The Cassandras may eventually turn out to be right, but for the last three years the gift horses have been galloping. For reasons I detail every year, even the most mega meta-list could never tell us which recordings were, in fact, the "best" of the year.  [Feel free to skip this list of reasons, but: PR and distribution influence what reaches the ears of critics worldwide; our judgments aren't completely independent; we tend to be more interested in some genres than other equally worthy ones, like band music; and we have unconscious biases that will someday be more apparent than they are now. It will someday feel odd, for example, that almost all of the composers had Y chromosomes.] But if not all the cream could ever rise to the top of any list of lists, what did rise was grass-fed free-range organic AAA-grade, and without aggregation some of it could have been missed. And who knew that the album that dominated the list would be an indie release of a brand-new work fostered by a rare collaboration of performer and composer? The envelope please: _______________________________________________  RECORD OF THE YEAR (22 votes) HANS ABRAHAMSEN, Let Me Tell You - Barbara Hannigan, soprano, with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Andris Nelsons (Winter and Winter NMC 197)     The release that soared to the top of the list contains a single cycle lasting 33 minutes but feeling more substantial than many operas. When Let Me Tell You had its Boston premiere, says Fresh Air’s Lloyd Schwartz, “at the end, after a full minute of stunned silence, it got one of the most sustained ovations I've ever heard for a new piece.” The reason was partly the gripping performance by soprano Barbara Hannigan, a Canadian who is also a notable composer and conductor. Indeed, she contributed far more than just great performance, but was central to the work's genesis. It was Hannigan who thought of setting a text from a novel by Welshman Paul Griffith, which he wrote with only the 483 words used by Ophelia in Hamlet. And it was Hannigan who decided that the perfect composer for it would be a 63-year-old Dane named Hans Abrahamsen. In turn, just as Handel or Mozart tailored music to specific singers or instrumentalists, Abrahamsen consulted at length with Hannigan about her vocal techniques, ranging from Italian Baroque to modern practices, in order to make full use of them. The other reason for the ovation was the music that resulted from this collaboration. Let Me Tell You shows that Shakespeare can still inspire musicians to their highest peaks, as he did for the likes of Mendelssohn and Verdi. The cycle's beauty is mesmerizing and sometimes other-worldly, yet always deeply humane. The Ophelia whose inner life it evokes is more complex than the original character, and stronger. Her final words are “I will go on,” and Abrahamsen and Hannigan make us feel them more vividly than we could on our own. Giving such a voice to the most haunting of victims is no small achievement, but there's more. As Schwartz notes, Let Me Tell You explores not only Ophelia's experience but also "questions of time and memory, nature and human isolation. And what is music if not time, Ophelia sings in Let Me Tell You. Time of now and then tumbled into one another, time turned and loosed, time sweet and harsh. Most important, these haunting works are also extremely moving. Without affection music means nothing...” The recording deserved affection, and earned it from 22 lists from around the globe. Here’s a youtube of a section from one of Hannigan’s live performances last year:      _______________________________________________________   GOLD (10-20 votes) Prediction is hard, but disconfirmation is easy. In 2008, a pundit asserted that the “remaining three 'major' labels will be out of the classical business within two years." Instead,  in 2016 the major labels gave us most of the classical releases chosen for 1o lists or more.  Save for the wintry Let Me Tell You and a Sibelius CD from Minnesota, all were on either Sony or Deutsche Grammophon, a division of Vivendi. Whether you consider that a good thing (the major media conglomerates are seriously into classical again!) or a bad one (conglomerates dominated classical!), it suggests that classical projects made sense to presumably skeptical, tight-fisted Chief Financial Officers. And it's good to note that while the major labels still sometimes push "crossover" projects centered on pretty people performing fluff, what impressed critics was major repertory played by serious interpreters. On to the picks: DMITRI SHOSTAKOVICH: Under Stalin's Shadow - Symphonies 5, 8, and 9; Hamlet incidental music - Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andris Nelsons (Deutsche Grammophon 479 520)  If the name "Andris Nelsons" sounds familiar, perhaps it's because he was  the conductor of Let Me Tell You. The 38-year-old Latvian is the new music director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus and is continuing in that role with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which appointed him in 2015. With the latter group, he recorded a Hamlet-based set that is much lighter than Let Me Tell You, having been written for a farcical Moscow production of the play. But the composer, Dmitri Shostakovich, was arguably the greatest symphonist of the 20th century, and the main focus of this recording is a set of three of his symphonies that together form a perfect introduction to his range. You should hear this recording even if you already have many other Shostakovich albums in your collection; it is that outstanding.  Shostakovich wrote his Fifth Symphony in 1937 after Pravda denounced his Fourth for its "formalism." To quote NPR, "​Fearing arrest, torture and even death, the composer, with sly brilliance and a remarkable spirit, found a way to compose music which appeared to adhere to Stalin's directives while subtly weaving a deeper and sardonic musical truth." Then, at the depths of the war in 1943, Shostakovich wrote the overtly dark Eighth, which, to quote Susan Scheid, was "banned in 1948 by decree of the Party’s Central Committee following a series of hearings on charges brought against 'deviant artists'.” That ban also applied to 1945's more comical Ninth, even though earlier it had been nominated for the "Stalin Prize," which, of course, it did not win. Nelsons knows from experience about making music under the totalitarian boot. He was 12  when the USSR collapsed, freeing his native Latvia and allowing his grandfather to return home after 15 years in Siberia. Nelsons later studied conducting at the St. Petersburg Conservatory under an old Soviet maestro.  He understands Shostakovich as few conductors do, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra clearly finds him inspiring. I have loved the BSO's self-produced recordings for years, but it's wonderful to see them again on the prestigious "yellow label," DGG. As expected, the recorded sound is demonstration quality. JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH: French Suites - Murray Perahia, piano (Deutsche Grammophon 479 6565)  I've felt for a while that we live in a golden age of Bach playing, and gained confidence in the feeling when the not-easily-impressed David Hurwitz said the same in print. We can count the 2016 meta-mega-list as evidence. No fewer than thirty recordings of Bach's music made someone’s list, about 5% of all the recordings that received at least one vote. The preponderance of Bach conveys how much musicians wanted to record his music and how many of them did it superbly. The sheer number of Bach recordings made it hard for any one to make the meta-list, yet one release stood out, and it shows that sometimes things go right in the world. It featured the great American pianist Murray Perahia. After recovering from a hand injury that almost ended his career, Perahia recorded some of the greatest Bach on record for Sony. Now 70 years old, in 2016 he made his first recording for Deutsche Grammophon, and his playing is better than ever. If you love Bach,  be sure to hear it. It will remind you, among other things, that the French Suites include some of Bach’s most profound music. During the time he was separated from the piano, Perahia says, what kept him sane was studying Bach's scores. He became fascinated by Bach's use of harmonic tension (a skill Bach's sons referred to in his obituary), and in these suites I've never before felt the expressive power of the dissonant notes so fully. Perahia also internalized a feeling for the Baroque idioms that Bach references throughout these suites. For example, in the canarie-style Gigue from the Second Suite, David Schulenberg warns that "the skipping rhythm is heard almost without a break" so that "there is a danger of rhythmic monotony," but with Perahia you instead feel exhilarated. FRANZ LISZT: TRANSCENDENTAL - Transcendental Etudes, Paganini Etudes, and Concert Etudes - Daniil Trifonov, piano (Deutsche Grammophon 479 552) Speaking of golden ages, Anthony Tommasini of the New York Times has applied the phrase to today's piano players. In the past, he said, piano lovers often had to choose between artists with stupendous technique and those with profound insight, but today dozens of pianists offer both. A recent example is 25-year-old Daniil Trifonov, whose seemingly magical touch makes a piano sound so ravishing that it transcends the physics of hammers and strings, but whose brain seems to understand perfectly why the composers chose the notes they did. (Unlike the stereotypical virtuoso, Trifonov is finishing a doctorate in composition in Cleveland.) You don't have to know much about Liszt to be enchanted by the sheer beauty of the sounds conjured. You might wonder how many music writers know our Liszt etudes well enough to judge this album against Kyrill Gerstein's 2016 recording on the indie Myrios label. Jed Distler, who knows these pieces profoundly, preferred Gerstein musically, while other knowledgeable critics preferred Trifonov, and the New York Times solved the problem by listing both in its end-of-year roundup. I like that solution. Classical musicians compete with each other as well as with a record catalog going back decades, and I wish there were a way not to have to compare varieties of excellence. That is exactly what we are forced to do by tournaments like "best-of-the-year" lists, so, like the NYT, let this one acknowledge both artists.   JEAN SIBELIUS: Symphonies nos. 3, 6, and 7 - Minnesota Orchestra conducted by Osmo Vanska (BIS 2006) With their then-new Finnish music director Osmo Vanska, the Minnesota Orchestra gained international prominence when the Swedish audiophile label BIS recorded them in a Beethoven cycle. Next up was Finland's most influential composer, Sibelius. BIS had recorded his symphonies with Vanska in the Nineties with Finland's leading orchestra, the Lahti, and many considered that set a modern reference. So why would BIS spring for another go-round? Perhaps sound recording continues to advance, or because BIS is known for taking risks, or because Vanska had been rethinking the works. The new cycle started well, but then was endangered when the orchestra fell into the longest labor dispute in the history of major American orchestras  - a 15-month lockout that led to cancelation of a Carnegie Hall gig and a European tour. Happily, our neighbors to the North eventually resolved the standoff, and you can consider this final disk in the new Sibelius series the comeback. The back-story itself could make it a sentimental favorite, but the interpretations are by no means routine. The flow and the atmosphere gripped many listeners worldwide, even in a couple of movements with notably unhurried tempos. The engineering is, sure enough, rich and realistic, with a dynamic range so wide that it will preclude listening in a moving car. LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN: Missa Solemnis - Laura Aikin (soprano), Bernarda Fink (mezzo), Johannes Chum (tenor), Ruben Drole (bass), Arnold Schoenberg Choir and the Concentus Musicus Wien conducted by  Nikolaus Harnoncourt (Sony) - "From the heart, may it go to the heart," wrote Beethoven over the score of his Missa Solemnis, which he regarded as his greatest work. But performances can sound shrill and disjointed. Not here. The conductor, who has recorded it twice before, unifies it here in a way that is rare. Harnoncourt founded the Concentus Musicus in 1953 to play early music on period instruments. By the 1980s he was conducting major orchestras, bringing iconoclastic imagination and ideas to every performance. Before his death last year at the age of 86, Harnoncourt asked that his final release be the tape of a 2015 concert of this Missa Solemnis. He'd recorded the work before with modern-instrument groups, but here returned to it with the Concentus Musicus, a much more virtuosic ensemble today than 50 years ago, and found new depths in it. You can hear why Harnoncourt wanted this release to be his final testament, as it is a kind of summation of his life's work. The Missa Solemnis contains some of Beethoven's greatest moments but for me, rarely gels as a totality. In this live performance it did, and I'm glad Sony released it commercially. WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART: Don Giovanni -  Karina Gauvin (Donna Elvira), Christina Gansch (Zerlina), Mika Kares (Commmendatore), Guido Loconsolo (Masetto), Kenneth Tarver (Don Ottavio), Vito Priante (Leporello), Myrto Papatanasiu (Donna Anna), Dimitris Tiliakos (Don Giovanni), Musica Aeterna conducted by Teodor Currentzis (Sony) -  In 2005, Greek-born Russian conductor Teodor Currentzis, a self-described "anarchist narcissist" and "crazy genius, said, "I am going to save classical music. Give me five or ten years. You'll see." The decade is up, and you can decide for yourself what we've seen. But Currentzis did release, in 2016, a recording that ten critics put on their favorites list. It's of the greatest of operas about an anarchistic narcissist,  Mozart's Don Giovanni. Having funding helped. Currentzis directs the Opera and Ballet in the Ural city of Perm (which the USSR once called "Molotov"), and seems to be generously funded. Opera is the most expensive of art forms, and Currentzis's recording sessions are three-week-long residential intensives preceded by endless rehearsals. When recording Don Giovanni, according to PRI's The World said, singer Simone Kermes "seemed a bit dazed after more than 50 takes of a short passage," and said, "Of course Mozart is difficult to record and what Teodor wants, it's like over what a human can do... He has no respect [for] the singer. Sometimes I hate him." As it turned out, Currentzis wasn't happy with that recording, and here Sony's deep corporate pockets gave him what few artist ever get: a do-over. Sony canned the first recording and funded a second intensive (Kermes was surely relieved not to be involved). Some critics found the final result too crazy, but ten of them loved its edginess. COMING SOON: As I mentioned, the "long tail" was even more fascinating than the top picks. Did it include any women composers? How much Bach WAS there? What other new works? Stay tuned... I promised to post the rest soon, along with some notes on my methods and a complete list of sources!

Jumia Travel shares 5 tips to help you speed it up. PINPOINT THE PROBLEM It could be an app, multiple apps, the storage or the system itself slowing down your device. Before you either fix your device yourself or give it to a technician to help you fix it, it is important you try to identify what the problem is or might be, and what the problem isn’t. With this knowledge, the problem will be easier for you to solve on your own or, if you decide to give the phone to a technician instead, it will help you avoid being cheated. A diagnostic app can help you pinpoint the problem causing your device to run slowly. Phone Doctor Plus and Z-device Test are good diagnostic apps to consider. You can find them on Google Play Store. Some Android devices come with diagnostic apps, like Samsung with the Samsung Smart Care app. In this case, you can take advantage of that rather than downloading another from the Google Play Store. CLEAR YOUR CACHED DATA This is more or less a temporary solution if your device’s slowness is caused by the unnecessary or ‘rarely used’ apps you installed. Cache data eats up system resources (takes up storage space on your device) while slowing down your device. You should clear this data from time to time or install a cache clearing app, like Clean Master, from the Google Play Store. You have nothing to fear deleting this data, anything important will simply be re-cached the next time you open the app. This is considered a temporary solution because you’ll eventually have to delete some of these apps you are clearing the cached data of, to more permanently fix the problem of your device running slowly. UNINSTALL AND DISABLE UNNECESSARY APPS If after diagnosing the problem, you find that a certain app or the multiple apps you installed on your device is causing your device to run slowly, you should immediately uninstall it. For apps that you cannot delete (those that come preloaded on your phone and are otherwise called ‘bloatware’), you should disable as many as you are not using to keep them from running in the background, choking your device’s storage and interfering with its speed and efficiency. You can uninstall or disable apps through the app manager found in your device’s settings, and keep these apps from becoming the ‘resource hogs’ that slow down your Android device. NOTE – You should also learn to close all apps you are no longer using. Don’t just open it and change to another app without closing the one you previously opened. This helps to free up your RAM and improve your device’s performance. FREE UP YOUR DEVICE STORAGE Aside uninstalling unnecessary apps, especially if the problem is caused by insufficient storage, you should also delete some of the many files (music, videos, documents etc.) that are filling up your internal storage. Make the sacrifice; delete those files you don’t actually need but keep for sentimental reasons. If you want to avoid, losing certain files completely, you can transfer them to another device (another phone, a laptop, or a tablet) or a flash drive or hard drive. NOTE – You can also consider disabling some of the widgets running on your device that you are not really using, alongside animations and live wallpapers you have running on your phone. Widgets, animations and live wallpapers may be fanciful, but they affect your device’s performance and battery live. PERFORM A FACTORY DATA RESET Over time, a lot goes on in your device’s software so it’s always advisable to give your device a fresh start from time to time. Know that this should not be done often, only from time to time especially when all the other tips don’t work as well as you want them to do. A factory data reset will wipe your device clean and leave the software the way it was when you first turned on the device; so be sure to backup important files before you do this. Some Android devices come with a “Backup and Reset” option in the device’s settings, so you can take advantage of that. Some other devices have a recovery menu for backing up important files. The steps are different for every device, so you can use Google to help you out with the steps for your device.

Annalee Newitz - Feb 7, 2017 8:30 pm UTC Enlarge / The burning of the Reichstag in 1933. Google searches for information about the Reichstag fire have shot up in the past two weeks. National Archives and Records Administration reader comments 227 Share this story World War II is having a moment, at least in the minds of people doing Google searches. Google Trends, a tool that measures the popularity of search terms over time, shows that there have been dramatic spikes in searches for topics related to the war, including: Reichstag fire, Pearl Harbor, fascism, Kristallnacht, and Nazi Germany. Searches for “Reichstag fire,” the event that precipitated Adolf Hitler’s declaration of martial law in 1933, peaked worldwide the month after the Brexit vote in Britain and again in October 2016 before the US election. Those searches eventually reached an exceptional five-year high in the first week of February 2017. In the United States, searches related to the event when Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe lit the German parliament building on fire were most popular in Arizona and New Hampshire. Global searches on Reichstag fire jumped after the Brexit vote, then again before the US election in November. The biggest spike came in the first week of February 2017. A massive spike of interest in Nazi Germany right before the US election in November. But let's keep this in perspective, folks. Searches on important subjects like "Lady Gaga" far outperform searches on Reichstag fire. As Berkeley statistician Hyunyoung Choi and Google researcher Hal Varian explain in a paper about Google Trends, there is not much of a secret sauce in computing what’s trending: The query index is based on query share: the total query volume for the search term in question within a particular geographic region divided by the total number of queries in that region during the time period being examined. The maximum query share in the time period specified is normalized to be 100 and the query share at the initial date being examined is normalized to be zero. The queries are “broad matched” in the sense that queries such as [used automobiles] are counted in the calculation of the query index for [automobile]. Worldwide searches on Kristallnacht saw a five-year high on November 9 and 10, 2016, the anniversary of the night when tens of thousands of German Jews were deported to death camps. There is always a small upswell of interest in this term every year on the anniversary, but in 2016, searches of the term in the US jumped from the 25-30 range to 100. The annual spike of interest in Pearl Harbor was also dramatically higher than usual, jumping from a previous high of 70 to 100. Further ReadingHow World War II scientists invented a data-driven approach to fighting fascism Searches on "Nazi Germany" jumped from typical levels of 25-50 to 100 in the first week of November, right before the US election. Worldwide searches for “fascism” also jumped from a baseline of 10 to 55 the week before the US election, but the authoritarian ideology saw an unprecedented spike in the first week of February, with searches for "fascism" jumping from 15-20 to 100 around the world. These searches don't mean millions of people are suddenly abandoning their interest in the usual internet fare: post-Superbowl searches on "Lady Gaga" are far more popular than those on "Reichstag fire." Instead, what Trends reveals are peaks of interest that are far above the typical amount. It may seem like these correlations between search terms and political events mean something, but it’s not always easy to show a direct connection between Google searches and real-world events. In 2008, researchers at Google published a paper in Science showing that Trends could predict flu season, with people’s searches for terms like “sniffles” and “cold remedy” always coming a few weeks before flu season hit. But then Google Flu Trends failed horribly a few years later, with its predictions off by 140 percent, showing that people don't always search for what ails them. There are counter-examples, of course. In their article about Google Trends, Choi and Varian remark that it’s an excellent tool for “predicting the present,” noting that upticks on searches for a given country are correlated with jumps in tourism to that place. It can also be a good leading indicator for the financial industry, surfacing consumer trends that affect markets. But can we track public mood or social changes through Google Trends? Data analyst Seth Stephens-Davidowitz thinks we can. In a now-famous study, he used Trends to predict how different counties would vote in the 2012 US election based on numbers of searches in those areas that contained racist words (the more racist searches, the fewer votes for Obama, even among people who typically voted for Democrats). Stephens-Davidowitz followed up with another study showing that areas with high numbers of racist word searches had higher-than-average rates of mortality among African-Americans. The upshot of this work, he argued, is that areas where people used racist words in searches were also areas where there were measurable signs of racism. When it comes to the current search spike on World War II subjects, Stephens-Davidowitz admits he's uncertain. "I am not totally sure what to make of it," he told Ars via e-mail. "It may just be people interested in this topic, so they can prevent a future fascist takeover of the United States." Further ReadingGallery: 70 years ago, US dropped unprecedented atom bomb on Hiroshima Interestingly, there have been no noticeable spikes in searches for other World War II topics, such as Adolf Hitler, the Holocaust, Weimar Germany, and the US bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It seems that people are focusing on popular ideologies during the war, as well as pivotal historical events. Perhaps they're turning to history to understand key events that are happening in our own time. Or maybe they're just hearing those terms a lot in the media and are trying to figure out what the heck pundits are talking about.

Rueter of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ordered Google to comply with search warrants for emails stored overseas. In the past, Google “routinely complied” with search warrants for user data stored outside the United States, but the company changed its practice following the Second Circuit’s decision this past summer in Microsoft v. United States. Microsoft effectively placed U.S. persons’ user data stored overseas out of law enforcement’s reach; the case was denied en banc rehearing last month by a divided court. Evidently, the Justice Department has been asking judges outside the Second Circuit to reject this ruling. Now, at least one has. The case arose from two search warrants issued in August 2016 under the Stored Communications Act (SCA). The SCA was passed in 1986 to ensure that Fourth Amendment-type protections extended to emails. The Act allows the government to compel service providers to produce customer subscriber information and other non-content data by subpoena or court order, respectively. Content data requires a search warrant. Here, the government obtained search warrants that ordered Google to produce electronic data associated with two U.S. account holders who were the subjects of ongoing criminal investigations. Google partially complied, turning over to the FBI some but not all of the data identified in the warrants. The data that Google did produce was located on servers within the United States.   The government then filed a motion to compel Google to produce the rest of the emails. Google responded that it could not be required to produce data stored outside the United States. Google pointed to Microsoft to support its position and justify noncompliance with the search warrants. The government urged the court to depart from Microsoft and compel disclosure. In Microsoft, the Second Circuit ruled that it could not enforce a search warrant for user data stored on Microsoft’s servers in Ireland. At issue was the extraterritorial application of the SCA, or more simply, whether a warrant issued pursuant to the Act could reach data held overseas. The Second Circuit relied on the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. to answer that question. First, the circuit court looked to the language of the SCA warrant provision (§ 2703) and determined that Congress did not specifically contemplate extraterritorial application. Second, the court looked at the “focus” of the statute to see if the case at bar actually involved extraterritorial application. The court decided that the focus of the SCA is user privacy, which would be invaded at the time the user’s data is seized—overseas. Therefore, the court held that it could not enforce the warrant.  (For more detailed analysis of Microsoft, see here, here, here, and here). In In re Search Warrant No. 16-960-M-01 to Google, Judge Rueter reached the opposite result and ruled in favor of the government. He did so not by adopting the government’s argument that the focus of § 2703 is disclosure, not privacy, but by distinguishing Microsoft. He stated that in contrast to Microsoft, here the privacy infringement would occur inside the United States. This court . . . respectfully disagrees with the Second Circuit’s analysis regarding the location of the seizure and the invasion of privacy. Judge Reuter proceeded to state the question before the court: The crux of the issue before the court is as follows: assuming the focus of the Act is on privacy concerns, where do the invasions of privacy take place? To make that determination, the court must analyze where the seizures, if any, occur and where the searches of user data take place. Framed this way, the question is somewhat different from that in Microsoft. In Microsoft, the court identified privacy as the focus of the SCA and asked where the conduct affecting user privacy occurred. Here, Judge Rueter asked what action, in the chain of events, constitutes a Fourth Amendment search or seizure, and where does that action take place. The distinction is subtle but important. As Orin Kerr pointed out in the Washington Post last week, the first question is purely statutory, while the second is constitutional. To answer the question thus framed, Judge Rueter looked to the Supreme Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence protecting individuals’ privacy from unreasonable search and their property from seizure. He reasoned that transferring user data from overseas servers to Google’s data center in California “does not amount to a ‘seizure’ because there is no meaningful interference with an account holder’s possessory interest in the user data.” He noted that Google transfers data between its servers located domestically and abroad all the time, and that none of these transfers involves a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, account holders’ privacy is not invaded until the government reviews the data. Because the search warrant requires Google to turn over the emails to FBI agents located in Pennsylvania, the conduct constituting a search will occur on U.S. soil.  Finally, Judge Rueter explained that to hold otherwise would yield an absurd result. If he were to follow Microsoft and rule that the data was not recoverable by search warrant, the government’s only avenue for compelling its production would be by Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT). An MLAT is a mechanism that allows the U.S. to seek another country’s assistance in a criminal investigation. But because of the way Google stores it data, an MLAT is not an option. Google uses an algorithm that divides an individual’s user data across data centers and even splinters the data such that an email is not stored as a “cohesive digital file” but in “multiple data ‘shards,’” each stored in a separate location around the world. There is no one country to which the government can address an MLAT for Google user data. This is in contrast with the situation in Microsoft, where there was one such country—Ireland. Unwilling to render certain Google user data immune to legal process, Judge Rueter ordered Google to “gather the requested undisclosed data on its computers in California, copy the data in California, and send the data to law enforcement agents in the United States, who will then conduct their searches in the United States.” Topics:  Fourth Amendment Tags:  fourth amendment, Stored Communications Act (SCA), Microsoft v.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Facebook, Google to help fight fake news ahead of French elections by Ivana Kottasova   @ivanakottasova February 6, 2017: 9:40 AM ET What to do about viral 'fake news' Google and Facebook are partnering with journalists to help prevent fake news stories from spreading during France's presidential election. Google News Lab and the non-profit First Draft News have launched a verification project called "CrossCheck" that will help French newsrooms identify and quickly debunk hoaxes, rumors and other false claims. At least 17 major news organizations are taking part in the project, including Le Monde, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Liberation, BuzzFeed and France Medias Monde, which manages Radio France Internationale and TV station France 24. Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) will provide the journalists with tools to help identify misleading content. Google Trends and CrowdTangle, a Facebook tool that monitors social networks, will be used to scan for problematic stories. Google will also train students from France's leading journalism schools in advanced search techniques that can be used to identify fake news. The students will add context to each false claim and create a live feed of shareable report cards on the CrossCheck website. The feed will be overseen by the Agence-France Presse. The public will also be able to submit questions and links to disputed stories. Their questions will be answered on a dedicated website. Related: Did fake news influence Italy's referendum? Google and Facebook both confirmed their participation in the project, but did not provide additional details. The first round of French elections will be held on April 23. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far right National Front party, is well positioned to advance to the second round of the presidential contest. She is not, however, currently favored to triumph in the second round runoff. Google and First Draft News partnered on a similar project during last year's U.S. presidential election. The initiative, called Electionland, was aimed at reporting evidence of voter suppression during the contest. Related: How Europe's elections could be hacked Misleading stories and flat out fake news have plagued social media during major elections around the world. Facebook, Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and other companies have been under intense criticism over their approach to the problem. Facebook is now attaching warning labels to made-up stories in some markets, and the company has taken steps to undercut the business model used by fake news publishers.

Phones by Jessica Dolcourt February 7, 2017 11:15 AM PST @jdolcourt My AI is smarter than your AI. That's the taunt that Samsung Galaxy S8 owners may be able to lob at Google Pixel users if the S8's rumored Bixby Assistant launches with seven or eight languages, as reported by SamMobile. Enlarge Image Samsung's Bixby AI will go after Google Assistant, Apple's Siri and Amazon Alexa for phones CNET In the Google Pixel, Assistant currently supports two languages, according to Google's website: English and German. The Google Allo app, which also uses Google Assistant and works on more phones, supports five languages: English, German, Hindi, Japanese and Portuguese. (You can still use Google's voice search/Google Now with many more languages on the Pixel phones, but the Google Assistant launch gesture turns off when you switch your primary language to, say, Spanish.) Launching its own smart AI assistant is an important move for Samsung and its future Galaxy and Note phones. The company, which strives to dominate the smartphone world against Apple's iPhone, stands to win fans if its Bixby assistant can outperform Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, which will land on its first phone later this month. This isn't the first time that Samsung has tried to out-Google Google either. The company hoped to supplant Google's voice search tool with Samsung's branded S Voice app, and introduced other software services of its own. The company has largely pulled back on preloaded apps and shuttered some of the services, so it'll be interesting to see how well Bixby AI will be able to compete with more established assistants, especially in these early days of AI on phones.

The company took down 1.7 billion ads that violated its advertising policies in 2016 – more than double the number taken down in 2015. “If you spent one second taking down each of those bad ads, it’d take you more than 50 years to finish,” Scott Spencer, director of product management with Google Canada’s Sustainable Ads division, wrote in a Jan. 25 blog post. Though Google employs a strict code of ethics designed to protect users from “misleading, inappropriate, or harmful” ads, it doesn’t stop certain parties from promoting illegal products or unrealistic offers, or from tricking users into sharing personal information or infecting their computers or mobile devices with a virus. “Ultimately, bad ads pose a threat to users, Google’s partners, and the sustainability of the open web itself,” he wrote. To address the problem in 2016, Spencer wrote, Google expanded its policies to better protect users from misleading and predatory offers – for example, banning ads for payday loans in July, which subsequently resulted in 5 million payday loan ads disabled – and improved its technology to identify and disable misleading ads, such as the “trick to click” ads which often appear as “system warnings” but cause users to download malware. In 2016, Google’s systems detected and disabled 112 million “trick to click” ads alone, he noted, six times the number disabled in 2015. Here are five other examples of misleading ads that Google fought against in 2016: Ads for illegal products: Google disabled more than 68 million ads for violating the company’s healthcare terms, a steep rise from the 12.5 million disabled in 2015. It also took down more than 17 million ads violating its illegal gambling conditions. Misleading ads: “We don’t want you to feel misled by ads that we deliver, so we require our advertisers to provide upfront information for people [to] make informed decisions,” Spencer wrote. Ads that drive clicks by asking, “Are you at risk for this rare, skin-eating disease?” or offering miracle cures that will help you lose 50 pounds in three days by swallowing a pill are on Google’s hit list: the company took down nearly 80 million ads last year for deceiving, misleading, or shocking users. Self-clicking mobile ads: Google only needed to delete a few thousand of these ads, which automatically send users from a website to the Google Play or App Store to download a malicious app, in 2015, but in 2016 its systems detected and disabled more than 23,000. Ads that try to game the system: Unscrupulous advertisers who know that Google blocks ads for weight loss supplements or payday loans will often attempt to trick its systems into letting them through by pretending to advertise something else. Last year the company took down almost 7 million of these. Tabloid cloakers: This new type of scam, fresh to 2016, attempts to fool Google by pretending to be news. Cloaker ads will take advantage of a timely topic – the 2016 U.S. election, a trending news story, or a popular celebrity – and make their ads look like headlines on a news website… which then redirects users to a commercial website selling products banned from Google. To fight cloakers, Google suspends the offending company accounts – more than 1300 in 2016. “Unfortunately, this type of bad ad is gaining in popularity because people are clicking on them,” Spencer wrote. “During a single sweep for tabloid cloaking in December 2016, we took down 22 cloakers that were responsible for ads seen more than 20 million times by people online in a single week.” He also noted that sometimes Google suspends the website promoted in a given ad: For example, the company took action against more than 15,000 sites for unwanted software; 47,000 sites promoting weight-loss scams; 8000 sites promoting payday loans; and suspended around 6000 sites and 6000 accounts for advertising counterfeit goods, such as imitation designer watches, last year.

More News Game of Thrones star warns winter isn’t coming in Google Maps 360 video tour of Greenland By John McCarthy-07 February 2017 10:53am Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, of Game of Thrones fame, is touring Greenland with Google, documenting the retreat of the ice caps, at a time when climate change skepticism takes root in the White House and beyond. Coster-Waldau, who plays Jamie Lannister the Kingslayer on Game of Thrones, a show that often warns "winter is coming", takes to the 360 video project to warn of the dangers of increasing temperatures across the planet. Partnered with the Google Street View team, it is hoped that by seeing the effects of climate change, in fully immersive 360 video no less, that the public can be mobilised to make the necessary changes. Hitting home the point, the team shared a timelapse of the melting caps across the last few decades. Coster-Waldau, also a UN Goodwill Ambassador, wrote in the Google Blog: “Greenland, which I consider my family's second home, is changing faster than anywhere else on Earth. Here the effects of climate change are easy to see: as sea ice melts and glaciers crumble, places once covered in ice are now bare land. “We have a responsibility to protect this beautiful planet we live on, and I’m starting at my own front door. But everywhere and everyone is vulnerable to the effects of our warming planet. Let’s band together and do something about it—learn about global efforts to combat climate change and discover ways to take action.” Watch the making-of documentary below.

David A. Graham Feb 10, 2017 Fifty Shades Darker: A Spoilereview Christopher Orr Feb 10, 2017 Robinson Meyer Feb 7, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Last week, Google pushed one of the most interesting sectors in Silicon Valley toward maturity—and brought a milestone in cartography closer to reality. It accomplished all that, paradoxically, by getting out of the market. From a business standpoint, here’s the news: Google sold its in-house satellite business, known as Terra Bella, to Planet, Inc. Planet is a startup based in San Francisco that already operates a fleet of 60 orbiting cameras the size of shoeboxes. With the acquisition, Planet is now the de facto leader in the small-satellite space, and it will add Terra Bella’s seven high-resolution satellites to its own constellation of medium-resolution craft. As part of the deal, Planet will give Google access to its growing archive of imagery for at least the next few years. But the more interesting development has less to do with acquisitions and more with technological capacity. Planet also announced that it will deploy 88 small satellites later this month, as part of a rocket launch from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in southeastern India on February 14. Assuming that most of the spacecraft make it to orbit intact, these satellites should become fully operational by the summer. When that happens, Planet will be the first to hit a long-discussed milestone in the industry: It will photograph every place on the entire planet every day. Every park, every rice paddy, every patch of pine and permafrost: all will be imaged anew, daily, at medium resolution. Planet says that the India launch will break the record for most satellites deployed on a single rocket. Launches remain one of the most costly aspects of the space business, and the company has gotten burned for its frugality before. Its leaders know, from firsthand experience, that not its satellites all will survive the journey to space. In October 2014, Planet became the first company ever to lose 26 satellites at once when an Antares rocket exploded on the tarmac. Nine months later, it lost another eight spacecraft when a SpaceX rocket failed before it left the atmosphere. But if even a minority of the satellites make it into orbit, Planet will operate the largest private satellite constellation ever built. The Iridium Communications constellation, which encompasses 72 satellites, holds that title now (though Iridium’s satellites are more expensive than Planet’s and they orbit farther from Earth). This constellation will have two components. A standard Planet satellite, which it calls a “dove,” is cheaply made. It is essentially an extra-large Cubesat, a widely used standard for building small spacecraft. It captures pixels that are three meters to a side. Each of the seven Terra Bella satellites, on the other hand, is about the size of a dorm-room fridge. A Terra Bella satellite detects pixels that are 90 centimeters to a side under good conditions. “You can use the medium-resolution constellation to scan the planet every day, and then—say you see a plane crash or a flood in a town—you can use the high-resolution satellites to snap those changes,” says Will Marshall, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Planet. He said the dual-layered constellation opened up new capabilities for the company. “If we see a change in the middle of Siberia, in some field, we won’t point the high-resolution satellite at that,” he told me. “But if we detect some change in downtown Kiev, it might be good to have a high-resolution image. ” Related Stories The American Landscape, From Space The Start-up That Watches Corn Grow, From Orbit The sale and acquisition caps off half a decade of growth and turmoil in the sector. When I first wrote about the small-satellite industry three years ago, it seemed a rare locus of hardware innovation in a software- and services-obsessed technology industry. Earth-observing satellites require, at minimum, high-quality image sensors and reliable radio antennas. The smartphone boom had transformed both: Thanks to economies of scale and foreign electronics manufacturing, the bare technological components of a satellite had become both cheap and nearly industrial-grade. Taken together, this allowed companies to build much cheaper satellites. Unlike legacy players in the business, which build a single satellite worth tens of millions of dollars over the course of years, a startup could build lots of small satellites fast and hurl them into orbit. Losing a satellite during launch, which was once cause to ready a company’s obituary (or at least its legal team), would now become a point of pride. “If you never lose a satellite, you’re not pushing the envelope,” Marshall told me at the time. The two frontrunners in the industry were firms called Skybox Imaging and Planet Labs. Skybox planned to build a small fleet of medium-sized satellites that could capture high-definition video of Earth. Planet Labs, on the other hand, wanted to flood the lowest reaches of orbit with shoebox-sized cubesats. You might be able to figure out where this is going. In June 2014, Google purchased Skybox for $500 million. It relocated the company closer to its campus, then rechristened it Terra Bella in March 2016. Meanwhile, Planet Labs bought the German satellite company BlackBridge. It kept sending rounds of new Cubesats into the sky. Eventually, it dropped the “Labs” from its name. Planet and Terra Bella—the two firms that, under different names, defined the industry three years ago—are now one organization. Planet is now the obvious front runner, and the sector is its to define. Planet medium-resolution “doves” captured this image of autumn color in New Hampshire in October 2016. (Planet) A high-resolution Terra Bella satellite took this image of Istanbul in September 2016. (Planet) Not that the game is over. DigitalGlobe, a $700-million public company that provides much of the base imagery for the U.S. government and Google Maps, remains the juggernaut in the remote-sensing space. Its newest WorldView satellites have nine-times the resolution of the best Terra Bella craft. They are also the size of small trucks. Last year, the company signed a deal with the technology accelerator for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to build a private constellation of Earth-observing small satellites. It’s possible to imagine a future where DigitalGlobe takes its own small-satellite, medium-resolution image of Earth everyday—except that it will be augmented by the military-grade imagery of the WorldView constellation. There are smaller competitors as well. BlackSky—which, in an industry built by spooks, somehow still has far and away the spookiest name—released the first images from its first satellite in November. It says 59 more satellites will follow by the close of the decade. Another startup, Spire, offers global weather forecasts through an orbiting Cubesat network. And no matter who “wins” in the space, other companies will clamor around the victors. Orbital Insight and Descartes Labs are two startups that sell computer-generated reports based on Planet’s satellite imagery. Their chief customers are financial firms, insurance companies, and farmers. A complete image of Earth’s surface, updated daily—this has long been the promise of the small-satellite industry. When it’s finally achieved, it will be critical that it help not only Goldman Sachs and Monsanto, but also humanitarians, climate scientists, and land-rights groups. But it will also be crucial that people appreciate all the exquisite specificity of the image. Planet is already photographing one-third of the world everyday. Marshall said that the most impressive part of the archive is how much it changes. “We have this psychology that the Earth is static-ish,” he told me. “But I think that has a lot to do with maps we were brought up with, and the fact that the satellite maps we see online are static.” He continued. “When we get an image down, whenever we compare it to the previous image we took of that same place a couple of days before—every time, we see changes. Either a tree has been taken down, a building has been added, a truck or a ship moves, and sometimes a river moves and you don’t notice it. A field is tilled. Things change every day in every picture we get.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video The Crippling Fear of Everlasting Life While many dream of an afterlife, people with apeirophobia are terrified of eternal existence. Caitlin Cadieux and Daniel Lombroso Feb 8, 2017 About the Author Robinson Meyer is an associate editor at The Atlantic, where he covers technology. Twitter Facebook Email Most Popular Presented by Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement Rosie Gray White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is reportedly a reader of neoreactionary political theory. A tour through the pro-authoritarian philosophy gaining visibility on the right. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been in contact via intermediaries with Curtis Yarvin, Politico Magazine reported this week. Yarvin, a software engineer and blogger, writes under the name Mencius Moldbug. His anti-egalitarian arguments have formed the basis for a movement called “neoreaction.” The main thrust of Yarvin’s thinking is that democracy is a bust; rule by the people doesn’t work, and doesn’t lead to good governance. He has described it as an “ineffective and destructive” form of government, which he associates with “war, tyranny, destruction and poverty.” Yarvin’s ideas, along with those of the English philosopher Nick Land, have provided a structure of political theory for parts of the white-nationalist movement calling itself the alt-right. The alt-right can be seen as a political movement; neoreaction, which adherents refer to as NRx, is a philosophy. At the core of that philosophy is a rejection of democracy and an embrace of autocratic rule. Continue Reading Jeffrey Smith How to Build an Autocracy David Frum The preconditions are present in the U.S. today. Here’s the playbook Donald Trump could use to set the country down a path toward illiberalism. It’s 2021, and President Donald Trump will shortly be sworn in for his second term. The 45th president has visibly aged over the past four years. He rests heavily on his daughter Ivanka’s arm during his infrequent public appearances. Fortunately for him, he did not need to campaign hard for reelection. His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains. The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies and his TrumpWorks infrastructure program.

David A. Graham Michael Flynn reportedly misled the vice president about conversations with Russia. Sean Spicer has never found his stride. Kellyanne Conway is in Congress’s sights. Welcome to Survivor: West Wing. It is a truth universally peddled by wisemen and -women in Washington, though not necessarily obeyed by presidents, that when the White House is in trouble, the best cure is to hoist the head of an adviser on a spike of the fence encircling the executive mansion. Firing—sorry, accepting the resignation of—an adviser makes for an easy way to demonstrate that the administration understands it has a problem and is working to fix it. That person doesn’t necessarily need to be the root of the problem, though it’s helpful if they’re at least somewhat involved. Other times, some bad press offers a useful pretext for pushing out someone who was already on thin ice.

There might be no getting around what Albert Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” With an experiment described this week in Physical Review Letters—a feat that involved harnessing starlight to control measurements of particles shot between buildings in Vienna—some of the world’s leading cosmologists and quantum physicists are closing the door on an intriguing alternative to “quantum entanglement.” “Technically, this experiment is truly impressive,” said Nicolas Gisin, a quantum physicist at the University of Geneva who has studied this loophole around entanglement.

We can renegotiate terms.” Ah, love. The above line is delivered to Anastasia Steele by Christian Grey near the beginning of Fifty Shades Darker, the second movie adaptation of the trilogy of zillion-selling erotic novels by Erika Mitchell (pen name E. L. James). But one imagines similar words being spoken by executives of Universal Pictures to Mitchell herself following the completion of the first installment in the series, Fifty Shades of Grey. That film was directed by the respected artist Sam (short for Samantha) Taylor-Johnson, and she and Mitchell reportedly fought over almost every aspect of the production, the latter having been granted uncommon creative control when she signed over the rights to her books. The result was a very bad movie, but one considerably less bad than the book it was based on. Continue Reading Michal Novotný How Your Cat Is Making You Crazy Kathleen McAuliffe Jaroslav Flegr is no kook. And yet, for years, he suspected his mind had been taken over by parasites that had invaded his brain. So the prolific biologist took his science-fiction hunch into the lab. What he’s now discovering will startle you. Could tiny organisms carried by house cats be creeping into our brains, causing everything from car wrecks to schizophrenia? No one would accuse Jaroslav Flegr of being a conformist. A self-described “sloppy dresser,” the 53-year-old Czech scientist has the contemplative air of someone habitually lost in thought, and his still-youthful, square-jawed face is framed by frizzy red hair that encircles his head like a ring of fire. Certainly Flegr’s thinking is jarringly unconventional. Starting in the early 1990s, he began to suspect that a single-celled parasite in the protozoan family was subtly manipulating his personality, causing him to behave in strange, often self-destructive ways. And if it was messing with his mind, he reasoned, it was probably doing the same to others. The parasite, which is excreted by cats in their feces, is called Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii or Toxo for short) and is the microbe that causes toxoplasmosis—the reason pregnant women are told to avoid cats’ litter boxes. Since the 1920s, doctors have recognized that a woman who becomes infected during pregnancy can transmit the disease to the fetus, in some cases resulting in severe brain damage or death. T. gondii is also a major threat to people with weakened immunity: in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, before good antiretroviral drugs were developed, it was to blame for the dementia that afflicted many patients at the disease’s end stage. Healthy children and adults, however, usually experience nothing worse than brief flu-like symptoms before quickly fighting off the protozoan, which thereafter lies dormant inside brain cells—or at least that’s the standard medical wisdom. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Michael Flynn's Debacle David Frum Trump’s national security adviser’s potentially false statements about his pre-inauguration contacts with Russian officials are a major scandal. “This reminds me of the run-up to Iran- Contra.” The person offering that gloomy observation was a veteran of many years in and around the US defense community. Unusually for a person with such a background, he had been a Trump supporter even during the Republican primaries. Now, though, he was worried. The new National Security Council leadership was taking form—and he feared he saw history repeating itself. “The National Security Council,” he warned, “is not one executive body. It is a deliberative body.” But the new national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, obviously hungered to carry out policy, not merely preside over policy formation. That way lay the disaster that had befallen Reagan's national security advisers Bud Macfarlane and John Poindexter in the 1980s, who were convicted of lying to Congress about the administration selling arms to Iran to finance anti-communist militants in Nicaragua.

The Wall Street Journal’s editorial features editor has left the paper following tensions over the section drifting in a pro-Donald Trump direction. News of the departure of Mark Lasswell, who edited op-eds for the Journal, comes as the paper’s internal tensions over Trump have begun to spill into public view. The reliably hawkish, pro-trade, small government conservative Journal op-ed page has been challenged by the rise of the populist, nationalist Trump movement. The Journal’s opinion pages have been a showcase for the intra-right divide over Trump, featuring Trump-sympathetic writers like Bill McGurn alongside anti-Trump columnists such as Bret Stephens. Lasswell appears to be a casualty of that divide, and his dismissal a victory for the pro-Trump faction on the editorial staff.

The suggestion was met with horror among privacy advocates. “With that kind of access, they can not only see what you’ve publicly posted, but things you haven't posted yet, private messages, private lists, they can impersonate you, and even do these things on accident,” wrote Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, on his website. “This kind of access is profoundly invasive.” Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters Trump Tried to Intimidate the Judges Over His Ban, and He Failed Garrett Epps Presidents have thought before that they could roll those wimpy-looking nerds with their gavels and robes. It usually doesn’t work out all that well. “Make this one out of cast-iron,” the late Judge John Butzner said to me one day in chambers. “There are going to be a lot of weasels sniffing around it.” I was Butzner’s clerk. He was assigning me to draft an opinion in a case on an abstruse point of federal law. No court had ever decided this particular question—and a lot of money was riding on the answer. Some judges on the Fourth Circuit would object to the result his panel had reached. Once Butzner’s opinion was published, they might try to persuade the other judges to rehear the case “en banc”—meaning on a bench including all members of the Circuit. It was a high-stress assignment, even though he gave me all the time I needed. Imagine the atmosphere in chambers this week as three Ninth Circuit judges and their clerks worked frantically to produce an opinion in Washington v. Trump—the case testing the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive orderbanning refugees from around the  world, and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > The Google Pixel audio bug has been fixed with the… The Google Pixel audio bug has been fixed with the February security patch By Adam Ismail — February 7, 2017 10:28 AM Subscribe Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you If your Pixel's speakers don't sound right, you're in luck - Google has released a fix. As the world has fallen in love with the Pixel, perhaps the biggest issue facing Google’s flagship right now is how to get the device in customers’ hands. For those who have been able to snag the phone, however, the problems are a bit different. Users have been reporting static distortion at high volumes through the device’s speakers since late last year, and up until now the company hasn’t been able to announce a clear-cut solution. Thankfully, a fix for the issue is on its way — the February security patch for the Pixel has been released, and several Reddit users with the Pixel are reporting that they no longer encounter the bug. The issue first came to light when a reddit user shared a conversation with a Google support specialist who said that the crackling audio woes are a hardware defect affecting “select builds of the device.” Two days later, another individual from the company offered a different explanation, claiming that the issue is actually software-based. Google is currently “working to resolve it in an upcoming update,” according to the representative who clarified the cause. More: Demand for the Pixel and Pixel XL now exceed supply Meanwhile, another customer raised a separate problem to Phone Arena. According to this user, the speakers on his device would produce little sound up until the halfway mark of the volume slider, when the very next attempt to increase it would result in maximum loudness. The representative responding to this issue also stated it was a software one, and that Google is aware of it and will rectify it in an update soon along with the other bugs. The audio problems don’t appear to be restricted to either the Pixel or Pixel XL or any specific configurations, which is another positive sign that they can be circumvented through software. Evidently, a solution couldn’t come soon enough. One customer, who shared his misfortune on Reddit and in the video above, stated he replaced his Pixel XL four times without getting a device that was free of the crackling sound, and that his wife’s standard Pixel was no different. While waiting for a fix, the community did manage a workaround in the form of custom firmware which utilizes a different audio driver. As always, messing with the stock firmware on your device carries a great deal of risk and is not recommended, so it’s encouraging to see Google has heard the complaints and hopefully will resolve them soon. In any case, if you don’t already have the February patch for the Pixel and Pixel XL, hold tight, as it should arrive soon. Updated on 2-7-2017 by Christian de Looper: added report that Google’s February security patch would address the bug.

What we’ve seen from Huawei in the past is a set of fairly good or really great components mixed with questionable execution. Here in the year 2017, Huawei has a smartphone that’s ready to compete with the biggest brands in the United States, as well as the rest of the world. The Huawei Mate 9 isn’t going to be given the same opportunity to shine in the United States that other, similarly priced and powered devices are. This is largely because Huawei hasn’t worked with and/or isn’t working with US-based mobile carriers the way brands like Samsung, LG, and Apple have for the past decade or more. The vast majority of smartphone owners in the United States today purchased them from the mobile data carrier that also sells them their mobile data. As Google will attest with their release of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, there’s a lot to be said for getting a smartphone physically present in the room where a consumer is looking for a new smartphone. It’s all about getting the device on the shelf at a store like Verizon and supported by the people who work there, making suggestions directly to consumers. Once either Huawei jumps aboard the carrier train or the general public jumps off said train, this brand will be in for a lot more business. Display While I praised the 1080p display on the 5.7-inch display-wielding Xiaomi Mi Note 2, here Huawei goes a bit far. Right up to and including 5.7-inches is a fine place for a 1080p display. Above that and using a 2K display (aka QHD) really makes a difference. I’d suggest that having a display with this resolution means a lot longer battery life, but with a phone this big, putting a large enough battery under the hood shouldn’t be an issue. For a person who is coming to this device from a 2K display on a smaller panel – like the Galaxy S7, for example – this display looks a bit strange. Moving from a tablet with no more than a 1080p display, this phone will look great. The same goes for users that want a bigger display without added sharpness – this hits that market right on the nose. Above you’ll see a pair of photos of the Huawei Mate 9 compared to the Google Pixel XL. These smartphones may seem similar on the surface, but their aims are just a bit different. While the Pixel XL is meant to be Google’s ideal vision of an Android phone for every different sort of person in the world, Huawei is aiming for a more unique sort of consumer. The sort that wants an IR-blaster, not to put too fine a point on it. Points of Distinction The Huawei Mate 9 has a number of hardware features that set it aside from the everyday average big-screened smartphone. Here in the year 2017, Huawei has come to fill the void. Companies like LG or Motorola make devices like the LG G5 or Moto Z with plug-and-play expansion features, while Huawei jams all the features that fit into a thin phone body into one device. There’s an IR-blaster that’s able to control any device with an IR receiver – most standard televisions can be controlled with an IR-blaster and the proper app. It’s a bummer that the IR-blaster, standard on high-end phones just a few years ago, has since fallen by the wayside for priorities. Even those that do not have cable TV can find the odd situation in which an IR-blaster can be used. In addition to 64GB of internal storage on this International Edition of the Mate 9, this device also has expandable microSD-based storage. For those models that feature the ability to use two SIM cards, the second SIM card slot is taken by the microSD card. This microSD card slot is able to roll with up to 256 GB of storage (on a single card). This device has two speakers, one out the bottom, one through the same grill as the earpiece. As you’ll hear in the video below, this setup makes for a slightly more surround sound-like experience and the potential for a louder experience than on most smartphones. Once I crank the volume to as loud as possible, the Huawei Mate 9 gets louder than the Google Pixel XL – and not just because there are two speakers instead of one. Unfortunately neither the Mate 9 nor the Pixel XL sound particularly fantastic when their volume is cranked all the way up. Both devices, on the other hand, perform admirably whilst connected to headphones through their standard headphone port. In the arena of audio, the Huawei Mate 9 will not let the average consumer down in any area save the loudest volume with its built-in speaker system. Camera System The Huawei Mate 9 uses a 12MP RGB sensor as well as a 20MP monochrome sensor. Both of these sensors work with one of Huawei’s 27mm-equivalent f/2.2 aperture lenses. With this setup, we’re getting details with the 20MP sensor and all the color with the 12MP sensor. The result is a single camera that, in the hands of a skilled photographer, has immense potential. The photos this camera-toting device takes are extremely well balanced and quite true-to-life. I’ll be doing additional comparison tests between the Huawei Mate 9 and other devices in the near future here on SlashGear. For now, have a peek at the gallery of photos I’ve captured with the device here. What might seem obvious here is the idea that 12MP photos give the best results for color photos, while 20MP photos are best left to black and white exclusively. As it turns out – that is entirely true. The folks at Leica (and Huawei) have created a system that makes all photos look extremely good to the average person, but have the best results in their native resolution. Color photos look good, while this camera’s black and white photos (with “Monochrome” mode) go well and beyond the call of duty. The photos of my shoes (below) show how much more pop monochrome photos have whilst capturing with the Huawei Mate 9. Photographers looking for the best black and white camera on a smartphone – this is it. The ability to capture black and white photos with a dedicated monochrome sensor makes all the difference. When I first saw the UI for the camera system on this device, it wasn’t quite clear what equivalent focal length I’d get when zooming. A recent software update – ready for release – now makes the entire process easier to work with. I can zoom in all the way to 2x before seeing any sort of quality loss in this camera setup. After 2x, it gets a bit messy, especially if I don’t use a tripod or something else to stabilize the camera. The tests I’ve done suggest that the Huawei Mate 9 is on-par – in most places – with the camera on the Google Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus. Obviously they each have their own special features, but the Huawei Mate 9 won’t lose a photography contest against any other high-end smartphone camera on the market today for lack of superior hardware and/or software. Performance / Battery Life Inside this device is a Huawei Kirin 960 processor. That’s Octa-core (4 x 2.4 GHz A73 + 4 x 1.8 GHz A53) plus an i6 co-processor. The GPU in this smartphone is a Mali-G71 MP8. Almost every smartphone we review here on SlashGear these days uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. As such, this Huawei processor is simultaneously like a breath of fresh air and something with which we’re inevitably more attentive. Huawei does not disappoint – the processor in this smartphone performs exceedingly well. Without knowing what SoC was inside, it wouldn’t be a stretch to guess that this smartphone was running one of the newest and most powerful processors from Qualcomm, or NVIDIA – or any other processor manufacturer we’re more familiar with. Huawei puts itself in the running here with Samsung – a brand whose associated business manufactures processors for its phones, too. This device keeps up with the swiftest of smartphones on the market today, working with response times only matched (and/or beaten) by the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. This device has had no trouble and will have no trouble running the most power-hungry and graphics-intensive apps on the Google Play app store today. Battery life has reached up to 8.5-hours with heavy usage with an active AT&T SIM (4G LTE) in a single day. That’s not unheard of for a smartphone with a similar display and battery size. Meanwhile thanks to the most recent couple of versions of Android – starting with Marshmallow – this device can last days on a single charge, just so long as it’s never powered on. This super-length for battery life is something that used to be normal for tablets – now it’s to be expected for smartphones, as well. Wrap-up The Huawei Mate 9 is an interesting combination of elements, one that sees the company move from strong branding to entirely solid smartphones in the international market. SEE ALSO: Huawei Mate 9 Review from an alternate point of view We’re still waiting for Huawei to enter the United States in full force – that is with a phone sold with at least one major mobile carrier. While we wait, Huawei’s already proven themselves as a sleeping giant, just waiting for that opportunity to grab hold of the USA’s smartphone-loving public. The Huawei Mate 9 is available in its International Edition (as seen in the review you’re reading now) through Huawei on Amazon. This smartphone is available in Space Gray (black on the front) or Moonlight Silver (white on the front – this is the one we’ve reviewed), for around $600 brand new and unlocked.

Responsible for helping create and lead Material Design, Jitkoff worked with product teams around the company to consistently deploy the design language. Before his broader role as Material Design’s principal designer, Jitkoff was a user experience lead for Chrome. He was involved in Project Kennedy, Google’s first big push to unify the design of the company’s products after Larry Page became CEO in 2011. The designer was also instrumental in helping create Material Design, launched in 2014. Most recently, his role involved working with marketing and search teams to insure that Google’s new design language was being enforced throughout the company. Dropbox hints that working on productivity was one of the reasons that the Googler jumped over. As vice president of Design, Jitkoff will work closely with Engineering and Product teams, as well as have oversight of Design Research, Product Design, Brand Design, and UX Writing. With Google’s recent aggressive expansion into the cloud and enterprise, Dropbox is a direct competitor more than ever. Just last week, the company launched its Google Docs competitor and announced a redesign of its web interface.

Google launched the AMP project to speed up the mobile web, but in exchange publishers have had to give up control of how their AMP’d content appears. One of the most irksome aspects of interacting with AMP pages is the convoluted URL structure, which causes users to be hesitant to share the content. AMP appends google.com/amp/ to the beginning of the URL when copying the link, opening it in a browser, or sharing an article. Visitors who want to find the canonical URL have to return to Google to search for it. To the casual observer, it appears the visitor has landed on and is attempting to share a Google story. After nearly a year, Google is finally looking to remedy this sharing problem with an update to the AMP Viewer header. In a post on the Google Developers blog, the company officially recognized this problem and announced a change that will allow visitors to share the canonical URL: Many users have requested a way to access, copy, and share the canonical URL of a document. Today, we’re adding support for this functionality in form of an anchor button in the AMP Viewer header on Google Search. This feature allows users to use their browser’s native share functionality by long-tapping on the link that is displayed. photo credit: Google The updated header with the anchor button is already available on the iOS Google app and will be coming to the Android app within a few weeks. Google is also working on using the Web Share API to let visitors use the platform’s native sharing flow with the original URL instead of the AMP viewer URL. “A thriving ecosystem is very important to us and attribution, user trust, and ownership are important pieces of this ecosystem,” Alex Fischer, Google software engineer, said. The ability to share the canonical URL is good news for existing AMP users but is probably not enough to convince skeptical publishers to start AMPing up their pages. Burying the publisher’s canonical link is just one of many reasons there has been such strong push back against the AMP project. Kyle Schreiber, whose post on the problems with AMP inspired discussions on Hacker News and Reddit, believes that “AMP is bad for the open web and should be changed or eliminated.” Schreiber contends that Google has designed AMP to keep the visitor within its own ecosystem. Publishers get locked in when access to Google’s news carousel is reserved for AMP’d sites only. “Clicking on an AMP link feels like you never even leave the search page, and links to AMP content are displayed prominently in Google’s news carousel,” Schreiber said. Last year the Wall Street Journal spoke with publishers who were critical with AMP but reluctant to speak publicly for fear of Google’s retaliation. Their AMP pages were generating around half as much revenue as pageviews on their full mobile sites due to Google’s limitations on the type of ad units available for AMP pages. Google’s response was that the company aims to drive more revenue to non-AMP pages but isn’t quite there yet. At the end of February the AMP project experiment will have been publicly launched for a year but many smaller publishers are still hesitant to get on board. They are concerned that AMP oversteps its reach without delivering enough value in return. The strategy of taking an absurd amount of control over publishers’ content and then slowly doling it back out (as with the new button for sharing the canonical URL) demonstrates how easily Google has established itself as the de facto arbiter of the mobile web. If publishers continue to yield control of their mobile content, Google will have every incentive to make AMP support the next official ranking signal.

He was the founding editor of the Russian business daily Vedomosti and founded the opinion website Slon.ru. Read More. @Bershidsky Feb 7, 2017 12:22 PM EST a | A By Leonid Bershidsky A Philadelphia court has made the unfortunate decision to reopen the legal debate on whether the U.S. has the right to access e-mails stored on foreign servers if they belong to U.S. companies. If Magistrate Thomas Rueter's ruling stands, anyone using U.S.-based internet companies will have to live with the knowledge that, as far as the U.S. government is concerned, it's America wherever they operate. That's a dangerous approach that hurts the international expansion of U.S. tech companies. Privacy-minded customers in Europe are already suspicious of the U.S. government's cooperation with the tech giants, revealed by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Nationalist politicians in some countries -- for example, Marine Le Pen of the French National Front -- want to ban cross-border personal data transfers, arguing that such data must be stored on servers inside the internet user's country. That, however, does not appear to guarantee that the U.S. won't get at it, either. Last July, Microsoft won a landmark case against the U.S. government, in which it argued it didn't have to hand over e-mails stored on a server in Dublin to investigators working on a drug case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with the corporation, ruling that the U.S. Congress never meant the Stored Communications Act to apply extraterritorially. Just two weeks ago, the court allowed the ruling to stand. The government may yet appeal it to the Supreme Court, but in the meantime, U.S. internet companies have assumed that if communications are stored abroad, they are out of the U.S. authorities' reach.  Acting on that understanding, Google refused to disclose two users' data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI went to court in Philadelphia. Unlike Microsoft, Google doesn't even know the physical location of a file: its artificial intelligence-based system constantly optimizes storage, so bits of one file can be stored in several geographic locations at once.  Judge Rueter refused to be bound by the Microsoft precedent. In his ruling, he disagreed with it, arguing that as long as an American Google employee gets the data using a computer located in the U.S., nothing extraterritorial is taking place: "When Google produces the electronic data in accordance with the search warrants and the Government views it, the actual invasion of the account holders' privacy -- the searches -- will occur in the United States." Within that logic, any information, public or private, that the U.S. government can locate using computers on U.S. territory is fair game. And if the logic applies, the European Union wasted its time last year as it tried to establish an acceptable privacy standard for U.S. companies operating in Europe. A new framework for these companies became necessary after the European Court of Justice struck down the EU's so-called safe harbor agreement with the U.S., which allowed internet companies to shuttle personal data back and forth between the two jurisdictions based on an understanding that the U.S. provided adequate protection for users' privacy. The so-called Privacy Shield, which replaced the "safe harbor" arrangement, is still pretty permissive, allowing companies to self-certify their commitment to user privacy, but it simplifies redress and gives European data privacy authorities more power over cross-border communication. If, however, the U.S. decides that it can just take the data from foreign servers, the new agreement will be rendered meaningless. For U.S. companies, this will mean a need to invent new private arrangements to protect European customers, the kind Microsoft proposed in 2015. It appointed Deutsche Telekom "data trustee" for two data centers in Germany, making it impossible for anyone, including Microsoft itself, to obtain any information from the servers without the permission of the trustee and, ultimately, the client. Such tricks, however, may not stand up in U.S. courts, if other judges agree with Rueter. The U.S. Supreme Court will probably have to take a stand on the issue: Google has already decided to appeal Rueter's ruling, and now that there are conflicting precedents, the government, too, will definitely want to pursue the battle to the bitter end. Waiting for a decision, millions of foreigners must decide whether to cut their losses in this front of the online privacy wars: It may no longer be OK to expose their lives to U.S. corporations. Those who are uneasy about the degree of the U.S. government's reach into their private files and communications need to start thinking about alternatives, no matter how hard it may be to replace Google, Microsoft or Facebook. As the U.S. becomes more hostile toward foreigners under President Donald Trump, there's no telling why the U.S. government may be asked to collect information. Some travelers to the U.S. are already being asked to reveal their social network histories in a broad search for terrorist connections. What if the government didn't even have to ask?

The advocates will be youth drawn from Google-supported initiatives: Webrangers Kenya - a youth online safety campaign started in 2015. Safer Internet Day is celebrated every year to promote safe and responsible Internet use. In the past two years, Google Kenya and its partners have observed SID with the rest of the world, reaching out to students, teachers, parents, policymakers and the press with internet safety messages.  “Our priority is to create a positive experience for our users, including young people. Our work in this area includes digital literacy, building an informed and responsible generation of digital citizens through programs such as Web Rangers and Hangout Bridges and building safety settings into our products so that families can make the choices that are right for them,” noted  Michael Murungi, Google Public Policy & Government Relations Manager for East Africa.  Election years are usually characterised by heightened political and social tensions. However, by harnessing the power of digital media, young people can be powerful influencers and effective brokers of social, political and cultural goodwill. It is therefore important to build young people’s ‘digital resilience’ - their ability to identify online risks and deal with them positively and responsibly - and to inspire them to be up standers, not bystanders, in creating a positive online community. ALSO READ: Voting, passion and our economic reality  “Technology platforms such as YouTube can be a force for good. They provide alternative content which promotes truth and understanding; that can drown out content that promotes violence, hate, or fear. The online community can create and find hopeful messages online, not harmful ones, especially during this election year,” added Mr. Murungi. In celebration of 2017 Safer Internet Day, Web Rangers trained by Google will launch a global action to inspire everyone at the local and global level to make the world a better place by promoting a safe and non-violent Internet. The call-to-action will be the Balloon Challenge in which a student will pick a partner, get a camera ready to record, face one another, write a hateful message on a white balloon and blow it up by hugging.

It's one of the few companies with targeting data that could challenge Google and Facebook. Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 7, 2017 at 1:29PM In digital advertising there are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, and then there's everyone else. But one company is starting to emerge as a potential contender to the two ad behemoths: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is starting to spread its wings as an advertiser. Amazon certainly has the user data to compete with Facebook or the big Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it has only 300 million active customers as of its last update, the shopping data it has on those users is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be able to target advertisements better than Facebook or Google despite their huge troves of user data. After all, nothing speaks louder than how people spend their money. Image source: Amazon.com. What's this other revenue line item, and why's it growing so quickly? During Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings call, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan asked about the "other" line item on Amazon's income statement. He pointed out that it's exhibited a lot of momentum over the past few years and wondered if that was due to growth in advertising. The other category includes "certain advertising services and our co-branded credit card agreements," according to Amazon's quarterly report. While Amazon did just revamp its credit card offering, it's been around in some form in the U.S. since 2002 and in Canada since 2012. The vast majority of growth in the category is probably coming from advertising. And it's been growing. Last year, other revenue in North America increased 60%. That accelerated to 81% growth in the fourth quarter. That makes it Amazon's fastest growing source of revenue, growing even faster than its cloud-computing service, Amazon Web Services. Granted, the other revenue Amazon brings in accounted for just 1.7% of its total North American sales -- $1.3 billion. So it's still working on a very small revenue base. Expanding its ad products Most of the ads Amazon sells are on its own websites. Search results on Amazon have an increasing number of sponsored products, with which third-party merchants pay to show up at the top of the page, not unlike Google's search advertising. Management described sponsored products as "off to a great start," indicating they see a lot of room for expansion. A report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and more people search Amazon for products, the more ads it can show. In fact, sponsored products could start stealing ad budgets away from Google, which is why Eric Schmidt said it's Google's biggest competitor in 2014. But Amazon's advertising is starting to extend beyond its own websites, wading deep into Google's territory. Last year it developed a header-bidding solution. Header bidding allows publishers to take more offers for their ad inventory instead of wading through each offer one by one and taking the first decent one they find. (This is all done extremely quickly by computer algorithms.) Amazon's advantage in the space is that it can perform the complex algorithmic ad bidding process in its AWS servers, enabling publishers' websites to load faster than other header-bidding systems allow. Google has historically dominated the space that header bidding threatens. As mentioned, Amazon is one of the few companies with user data that can compete with the targeting capabilities of Facebook or Google. So if it continues to build out its advertising products on third-party websites, it could start to take a significant share of revenue from Google and Facebook. Google generated $15.6 billion in revenue from its network members' websites last year. Facebook's Audience Network reached a $1 billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the company hasn't provided any updates since then. The digital ad market is huge. Advertisers spent $195 billion worldwide on online ads last year, according to eMarketer. That number is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2020. If Amazon can grab just a slice of the market producing high-margin revenue, it could provide a significant boost to its bottom line.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The changes can be somewhat minimal, with not many people noticing them, while others are quite a breakaway from what we have publicly. The latest test, spotted by a user on reddit, brings a card UI to the app section, allowing a user to swipe through the various charts of Google Play.  As you can see in the GIF below, the landing looks rather normal, but once you dive into “Top Charts,” the UI morphs into cards, with the interface powered by a user swiping through the various apps. The UI’s backdrop is the primary color of the app’s icon and header image, proving to be a very immersive look. I checked on a couple phones and I don’t have this UI, and your phone probably won’t have it either. These tests are typically quite limited, and as I mentioned, unless you’re actively looking for this stuff, you may never see it. Personally, I quite like this UI – It’s colorful and the idea of swiping through the Top Apps could be cool. However, just seeing a big list for easy skimming seems more efficient. Thoughts?

Google selling Terra Bella satellite imaging business to Planet Posted Feb 3, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story One of the worst comments sections on the internet is shutting down Google will sell its Terra Bella business, which includes a group of SkySat Earth imaging satellites, to Planet Labs, the companies confirmed on Friday after TechCrunch’s Ingrid Lunden first reported that a deal was going down on January 25. Google’s space-high view of the world in its mapping software isn’t going anywhere, however – Google will continue to license Earth imaging for its use from Planet in a multi-year contract that’s part of the sale arrangement. In a blog post announcing the news, Planet Labs’ Will Marshall notes that the seven high-res SkySat satellites it’s acquiring as part of the deal will be “highly complimentary” to its existing fleet of medium res satellites, which includes 60 units in total. Planet’s existing network can only get three to five meter resolution, while Google’s satellites can manage “sub-meter,” which is why images on Google Earth and Google Maps tend to be so crisp and clear, like the one you see above. Planet will use the Terra Bella capabilities to help grow its potential customer base: The company has a brisk commercial business, it says, through its existing medium resolution capabilities, but the higher-res imaging it’ll get now will allow it to appeal to more consumer endpoints and broach new markets, including for clients like Google itself. Terra Bella was itself an acquisition for Google, picked up as Skybox Imaging in 2014 in a deal valued at $500 million. Google has recently been realigning its business, beginning with the formation of Alphabet as an overarching parent company, and it’s likely that owning its own satellite imaging rather than licensing it from a dedicated provider is part of that ongoing rationalization of its various lines of business. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, though in TechCrunch’s original reporting a potential price for Climate Corporation, another prospective buyer, was said to be set at $300 million. Earlier on Friday, Planet announced a plan to launch an additional 88 so-called cubists, which are small, lower cost satellites. This will be the largest single launch of satellites at one time in history, and is currently scheduled for February 14. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase The Climate Corporation Founded 2006 Overview The Climate Corporation (formerly WeatherBill) aims to help farmers around the world protect and improve their farming operations with uniquely powerful software, hardware and insurance products.

The app also includes the ability to search for coworkers in your company’s directory. These results will include contact details, as well as events and files you have in common. From here, users can quickly send an email, start a Hangout, or make a call. Cloud Search will begin rolling out for G Suite Business and Enterprise customers. The product will add more capabilities and integration with third-party applications in the future.

Voices If Facebook makes billions from my data, I deserve the basic income as a dividend for my work Baby photos, birthday party invites and self-indulgent status updates are the coal, iron and steel of the fourth industrial revolution Kirsty Major @Kirsty_Maj0r Tuesday 7 February 2017 18:00 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Launching UBI is the key to finding the next Mark Zuckerberg ​“Why do I exist?”: a question that has preoccupied the greatest minds, and the rest of us after a heavy night out, since time immemorial. Today, it appears the answer is to simply make a lot of money for Google and Facebook. You and I are the raw material for these social media companies. Those baby photos, the birthday party invites and the self-indulgent status updates are the coal, iron and steel of the fourth industrial revolution. Facebook, Google and other major technology firms harvest the raw data you produce – the pages you like, the time and location stamps on your tagged photographs, your planned travel routes, and so on. Then they analyse this information and use it to sell advertising space to third parties. Last year those two brands alone made 96 and 89 per cent of their revenues respectively from advertising. In short, they made a hell of a lot of money from you. These figures are set to increase as the two platforms push for more users to access their services via apps, be it Facebook Messenger or Google Maps, so that they can bypass browser-hosted ad blockers. Historically, raw materials were sold for a profit to manufacturers; now, all you get in exchange for your data is to use these services for free. Hey, like a photograph of someone you would never say hello to in real life and in exchange you can give all your personal information over to a private company. Sounds a like crappy Faustian deal, doesn’t it? It's an especially unfair wager when you consider that both of these companies have come under attack for not paying their fair share of taxes in the UK. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg reveals his home-made Jarvis AI If these companies insist on not redistributing their wealth via taxation, where we would traditionally share the benefits through welfare or improved infrastructure, we deserve a direct cut to reward us for the hard work we're doing on their behalf – a ‘data dividend’, if you will. One mechanism to distribute this kind of reward might be the Universal Basic Income (UBI), a form of social security in which every citizen receives an unconditional sum of money, in addition to income received from paid employment or other sources. If advertising platforms disguised as online services are going to make money from our mere existence, then we deserve to be rewarded for just existing. This idea might not prove too distasteful to the tech giants either. Steve Waldman, a programmer and economics writer, called the basic income “venture capital for the people”, as it would encourage citizens to take the time to learn and train, innovate and take more risks – such as launching a tech start-up. Read more Renters need to earn £130,000 to buy a home in London. Fat chance There’s a moral case for basic income too. As the labour market adapts to new technologies, old jobs become redundant and we will all need to train for new ones. Tech companies ought to help out by funding these periods of unemployment and re-education – especially if they are directly profiting from the way they interact with new technologies in their daily lives. This is especially important for those languishing in jobs now at high risk from the fourth industrial revolution, and who will find it the most costly to retrain.  Uber, for example, is transforming from a sharing platform to a big data company by harnessing the wealth of information they know about you. At the same time it is seeking to replace costly drivers with self-driving cars. This means that, in the near future, Uber will have fewer drivers and more data analysts. So why not support a fund to create an education pathway from driver to desk worker? And why not encourage governments to do the same by offering a basic income that allows citizens to keep up with a changing economy. This isn’t just a utopian dreaming. India considering replacing its labyrinthine welfare system with a basic income scheme, and pilot programmes are being floated from Canada to Namibia. If the UK wants to foster the next Mark Zuckerberg, it might want to start rewarding the people for the raw materials they've already provided.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Google will release Cloud Search for some G Suite customers starting February 14 Jordan Novet@jordannovet February 7, 2017 9:41 AM Tags: Alphabet, G Suite, Google, Google Cloud Search, Google Springboard Above: Google Cloud Search, formerly known as Springboard, on desktop and Android. Image Credit: Google Google today said that it will begin to release its Cloud Search app — introduced last year as Springboard — for organizations paying for the G Suite Business and Enterprise editions on February 14. When Google first talked about the app, the company said it was only making the app available to organizations participating in the then-new early-adopter program (EAP). Soon it will be released more widely. The app is designed to surface the right content and services to you at the right time. Which means it’s reminiscent of Microsoft’s Office Delve app, which shows documents that are stored across multiple Office 365 services. Over time, Google expects to integrate more third-party services and not just show you things that are available through Google’s services. Here’s how Google Cloud product manager Brent VerWeyst sums up Cloud Search in a blog post: Cloud Search brings the best of Google Search and machine intelligence to G Suite. It provides both comprehensive search and proactive recommendations to help you throughout your day. For example, when you open the Cloud Search app on your phone or laptop, you’ll see relevant information organized into simple cards (assist cards) that help you stay on top of your work. Assist cards are a new way to help you find the right information at the right time. Using Google’s machine intelligence technology, these cards can help you prepare for an upcoming meeting or even suggest files that need your attention. Assist cards are designed to be timely and relevant so that you can navigate your workday more efficiently. As we continue to learn how information is most useful to you, we’ll be adding more assist cards to Cloud Search over time. In addition to searching for information, you can also search for people listed in your company’s directory. You’ll see colleagues’ contact details, plus events and files you have in common. You can even choose to send an email, make a call, or start a Hangout with just a tap. So in that sense, Cloud Search does more than just let you search for stuff on Google Drive. It’s more homepage than search tool, really, despite the name change. The Cloud Search app will be available on Android, iOS and the web. Organizations that have used Springboard Cloud Search through the EAP will see no changes, VerWeyst wrote. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

By Josh Seiden Jeff Gothelf At the North American International Auto Show in January, Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving car project, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV revealed a self-driving version of Chrysler’s Pacifica minivan. Press coverage of the announcement seemed confused: The New York Times said the van was “designed by Google” despite the fact that Waymo, Google’s GOOG, +0.51%  sister company, provided only the self-driving technology, while Chrysler FCAU, -0.56%  was responsible for the rest of the van. The Detroit Free Press’ headline at least credits both firms: “Waymo Reveals Self-Driving Chrysler Pacifica Minivan.” Still, it’s as though no one is quite sure who’s driving this thing. All jokes aside, the auto industry finds itself struggling to remain in the driver’s seat as software-driven disruption upends the industry, just as it is doing to all our old-line industries. Indeed, as software continues to “eat the world,” traditional businesses need to ask themselves: “Are we in the software business? Should we be?” Perhaps no industry is struggling with this question more than automotive manufacturing. Although GM GM, +0.26% Toyota TM, +0.87% Ford F, +1.05%  and others have built increasingly sophisticated cars that leverage software to improve performance (i.e. anti-lock brakes and emissions-control systems), they never succeeded in using software to improve the customer experience, much less radically transform it. Enter Tesla TSLA, +0.01% Spawned from the brain of tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, the luxury electric-vehicle maker is leveraging the business of software to redefine how the car business operates. The most recent example is a telling one: A frustrated customer tweeted about inconsiderate Tesla owners hogging spots at charging stations, leaving their cars parked long after their charge had been completed while they were off running errands or eating lunch. Musk saw the tweet and promised to respond. Six days later, Tesla released a new feature, implemented via the Tesla app, that would discourage parking at charging stations by imposing a per-minute fee on idle owners once their charge was complete. It would be easy to dismiss this story as simply a high-profile publicity stunt, except for this: For Tesla to respond this quickly required an impressive software operation capable of making and deploying changes quickly. This is not something that a CEO, no matter how remarkable, can do himself. It is the mark of a sophisticated operation built around production capabilities and product cultures that few non-software companies have developed. Indeed, more than any other operating tactic, the ability to sense a signal from the market and respond within days is what allows software companies to implement continuous improvement and deliver continuously increasing value. These rapid feedback loops could not be more different from the traditional rhythm of industrial companies, and is what sets software companies apart from their older siblings. Traditionally, car manufacturers use the “model year” as the marketing tool to spur new purchases, but they also accept this rhythm as the natural order of things. You want something better? Wait till next year’s model. This made sense when the only way to update a car was to roll a new design off the assembly line. Tesla, though, has created a software-first customer experience that allows them to solve customer problems as they discover them — whether it’s range anxiety or frustration with others’ behavior at charging stations — by updating the features in their vehicles overnight and over the air. This kind of continuous improvement is literally impossible with a Ford Explorer or Toyota Camry. How, then, do the traditional manufacturers of cars (and toasters and refrigerators and other devices) address this disruption? Unlike Ford and GM, which are attempting to create self-driving car technology themselves, Chrysler, one of the smaller U.S. automotive brands, in choosing to partner with Waymo, has chosen to outsource its technology stack: to look to tech leaders to provide critical subsystems for their vehicles, hoping for a relationship similar to other parts suppliers and OEMs. Google, via Waymo, and Apple AAPL, -0.23%  (via CarPlay) are all too happy to oblige. This gives them a level of impact and reach they didn’t have access to in the past. In return, the incumbents like Chrysler get a slick product experience that matches what their customers have come to expect from other digital interactions. The risk with this approach is not insignificant. Allowing other companies to control the user experience leaves you vulnerable to being displaced and commoditized. For an illustration, consider the case of Sonos, the maker of wireless-music systems. As much as the company was loved by customers for the quality of its speakers and the ease of use of a proprietary wireless-network system, customers struggled with its music-playing software. This year, Sonos partnered with Amazon AMZN, +0.74%  to give Alexa, Amazon’s personal-voice-assistant service, the ability to play music over Sonos. Sonos similarly partnered with Spotify to give Spotify users the ability to stream music directly to Sonos without using the Sonos app. A boon for Alexa and Spotify users, but at what cost to Sonos? Will giving up control of the user experience relegate Sonos to being a commodity-hardware vendor? Will the company become the Dell to Amazon’s Microsoft MSFT, -0.09% ? The other path for automakers is to create an internal-software capability and attempt to match the capabilities of the digital natives. This is an increasingly popular strategy for traditional businesses. Banks, retailers, even industrial manufacturers like General Electric GE, +0.44% are building software teams and directing them to create systems that deliver their services in new ways, or enhance their products with new capabilities. The companies that are succeeding are the ones that are mimicking the kind of market-sensing and continuous response tactics that Tesla is so good at. These are not easy choices for an incumbent to make. The partner path offers short-term wins — allowing them to deliver modern, sophisticated customer experiences in a fraction of the time — but the long-term risk to corporate autonomy may be too much to ask. The alternative — building a software capability that can operate in modern ways — isn’t as simple as increasing IT spending. Instead, it means driving a path of major transformation, adding not just technology skills, but changing operational rhythms, creating a listening and learning culture, and imagining where and how you deliver value to customers. It’s a difficult road? Can the automakers drive it? Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden, technology experts and founders of the global Lean UX movement, are the coauthors of the new book, “Sense & Respond: How Successful Organizations Listen to Customers and Create New Products Continuously” (Harvard Business Review Press).

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --February 2017 AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!! --February 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. February Keeney (Engineering Manager, Community & Safety, GitHub) is passionate about building inclusive workplaces and online communities. Presently, she is furthering these goals in her role as the Engineering Manager for the Community & Safety team at GitHub. February can frequently be seen taking photos of sidewalks and power lines. Left unattended at conferences, she will seek out a piano and start covering pop b-sides. February lives in SF Bay Area. Kristy Tillman (Head of Communication Design, Slack). Before her role at Slack, Kristy served as the design director for Society of Grownups, a venture changing the face of financial literacy for the young adult set. There she was dedicated to crafting and inspiring the brand across both the digital and physical experiences. Previously, Kristy was a designer at IDEO, working projects ranging from brand to digital design. She is a 2013 Media Ideation Fellow, and an alumni of Florida A&M University and teaches design at General Assemb.ly. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Hashtag: #mozSS July 20, 2016: The Invention Cycle with Tina Seelig, Stanford University Location: Mozilla MV + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, July 20 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Invention Cycle: Going From Inspiration to Implementation Are you stuck on where to go with your product and need an infusion of creativity? Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015).

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Warren Report How Breitbart Turned Tom Brady Into an Alt-Right Hero Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Warren Report How Breitbart Turned Tom Brady Into an Alt-Right Hero The Patriots quarterback has, somehow, been adopted as the latest victim of a liberal social-media conspiracy. (A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgFebruary 7, 2017 11:30 am Email Facebook Twitter By Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images. If only it were The Onion. But it’s Breitbart News. “Liberals explode with vitriol as #NotMySuperBowlChamps trends on social media” is the headline atop this profound cultural revelation: “As the New England Patriots took yet another Super Bowl win, liberals from coast to coast exploded with vitriol on social media, furious that a team with tangential links to President Donald Trump came out on top Sunday. Since that final touchdown, the hashtag #NotMySuperBowlChamps and other similar tags have been trending.” (Breitbart) Huh? “The left-wing sports media has been out for blood for the better part of a year because Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick, and team owner Robert Kraft all came out as unapologetic fans of President Trump. And now that they’ve won the Super Bowl, the left has turned apoplectic.” It even bought into one tweet whose author conceded he was joking with a faux anti-left diatribe. He later wrote, “Even Breitbart thought I was being serious. I guess parody doesn’t work when it’s so close to the loony reality.” (lamknight7) “But if I had to guess, this looks like it was made up out of whole cloth by Breitbart. Shouldn’t they be reporting on all the terrorist attacks you guys are ignoring?” said Andrew Rudalevige, a Patriots fan who’s a political scientist at Bowdoin College in Maine. “Given that the goal here is to blame anything Trump can’t control — like the media, like the judges — for everything that goes wrong, yes, they’re serious,” said Keith Olbermann, who’s starring in a series of web videos called The Resistance for GQ. “As even the kind of quick perusal of the Goebbels approach that the late Andrew Breitbart and his cheesier successors would’ve made, the propaganda has to get wilder and wilder, but more importantly it has to get faster and faster, as you move forward.” Oops For a very early print edition Sunday, The Boston Globe assumed that the giant deficit faced by the New England Patriots would stand. “A Bitter End” fronted that edition. (USA Today) “While the cutline reflected that the game wasn’t over, it was below the fold. So, readers who got the early edition of the Globe were treated to a headline that boldly implied the Patriots lost.” Fox’s O.T. bonus “Because ad sales are about managing contingencies, Fox had pre-sold a number of bonus spots on the odd chance that Super Bowl LI would require a little temporal wiggle room, and as that prospect became a reality, other brands began making inquiries of their own.” (Ad Age) “We always have overtime agreements in place, and did so this year,” said Fox Networks Group Exec VP-Ad Sales Bruce Lefkowitz. “We were also garnering commitments in real-time. We would have liked the greatest Super Bowl in history to go on forever, and were prepared if it did.” Trump, Bannon vs. The Times As Trump and Steve Bannon fulminate about the awful media, notably The New York Times, they might look at both a news story and an analysis by longtime Supreme Court and legal affairs writer Adam Liptak. Smart, measured, non-judgmental, fair. On the legal issues at hand on the immigration flap: “A ruling by the court on Mr. Trump’s travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries could help answer some crucial legal questions: How much independent constitutional authority does the president have over immigration, and how much power has Congress given him?” “The likely answer to both questions: a lot. But other parts of the Constitution may temper or defeat that power. Among them are the due process and equal protection clauses and the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion.” Bannon would be hard-pressed to find anything remotely as strong at, let’s say, Breitbart News. Headline of the day “This White House list contradicts Trump’s claim the news media ignores terror attacks” (BuzzFeed) Yes, more confirmable falsehoods. Watching the government’s overseas media This is from BBG Watch, a long-time, and at times decidedly contentious, newsletter by activists in an outside the Broadcast Board of Governors, which oversees media that includes the Voice of America: “Correction: An earlier version of this commentary had a reference to tweets and retweets allegedly posted on by a manager in the Voice of America Persian Service. We were subsequently informed that the Twitter account, which showed as having been started in March 2013 and, until it was shut down by last week, belonged to an impostor and not to any manager or staffer in the VOA Persian Service.” “...How such an allegedly impostor VOA Persian Service director’s Twitter account could have existed for so long and be followed by the VOA Persian Service itself, as well as VOA journalists and managers, without anybody at the VOA and the BBG alerting the public that it was a fake account, is still a mystery and a stunning admission of management failure at the Voice of America and the Broadcasting Board of Governors.” The take from Cambodia William Holland, a retired former State Department official who lives half the year in Cambodia, saw a piece here about the use of social media by the right-wing. He chimes in: “Cambodia offers an interesting example of the powerful impact of social media — in expected and perhaps unexpected ways. The original view was that social media in Cambodia (use of which is surging) would help opposition parties get their message out in an environment where the government/ruling party essentially controls the media.” “They have had in fact some success in this, but as the attached article argues, clever leaders can also use social media to great effect as well — at worse as ‘another tool of authoritarian power.’ The author may overstate the danger in the US, but worldwide this is a fascinating phenomenon to watch.” (East Asia Forum) Real reason tech firms fighting Trump immigration move It’s not that tech firms get much talent from any of the seven countries. But, “According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 24 percent of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce in computer-related occupations is foreign-born, compared with 16.7 percent of the general U.S. workforce. That’s only possible because the U.S. is so strong in the international competition for tech talent.” (Bloomberg) Now a court says Google must fork over emails “Just south of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal’s district, a Pennsylvania (3rd Circuit) federal judge has come to (nearly) the opposite conclusion on law enforcement’s access to emails stored overseas. The first case deals with Microsoft, this with Google, in particular “two FBI SCA (Stored Communications Act) warrants seeking emails that Google says aren’t stored in the United States.” (TechDirt) “Google, however, also says the sought emails could be at any of its data storage sites — which would include those in the US. It all depends on when it’s asked to retrieve the communications.” Alas, this new decision part company with the appeals decision, which concluded that emails in an Irish data center are not subject of warrants issued by U.S. law enforcement. “The court explains Google’s process for handling user data, which is built for efficiency, rather than what’s central to the FBI’s demands: efficiency of retrieval in response to law enforcement requests.” Here’s the latest ruling. Trying to keep sane “Outside of work, I don’t speak very much about my job reporting on crime and violence in my hometown of Chicago anymore,” writes The Chicago Tribune’s William Lee. “I’m sure this is a relief to my weary friends and family.” (Lee) “The truth is that I stopped talking shop outside of work for the same reason chefs don’t discuss the unsavory things they witness in their work kitchens — some topics just aren’t very appetizing, and few things are less enticing than the city’s much discussed violence.” And, as a result, “As a result, my home is a news-free zone on my off days; I’ll only scan a newspaper, allow for short visits to chicagotribune.com and avoid TV news broadcasts altogether. I’m not alone, knowing plenty of other journalists who cover crime and some cops who avoid news on their own time.” “Now, my mind is an endless log of murder victims’ names, faces and intersections where the shootings occurred. I can feel the pain of family and friends like I couldn’t as a young man.” White House “rattled” by Melissa McCarthy’s Sean Spicer As they should be, “White House rattled by McCarthy’s spoof of Spicer.” (Politico) You did see the SNL segment, did you not? “More than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts, it was Spicer’s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president’s eyes, according to sources close to him.” “And the unflattering send-up by a female comedian was not considered helpful for Spicer’s longevity in the grueling, high-profile job, where he has struggled to strike the right balance between representing an administration that considers the media the ‘opposition party,’ and developing a functional relationship with the press.” Does Gorsuch’s claim of assisting criminal defendants matter? There was a very thoughtful pushback on a pushback on a pushback on a pushback on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show last evening. It involved her clear sympathy for a Wall Street Journal story, mentioned here yesterday (with skepticism), that made a lot (too much) out of Neil Gorsuch’s claim of having done volunteer criminal justice work while at Harvard Law School. Dahlia Lithwick, a fine legal affairs reporter for Slate, said this question was ultimately irrelevant to considering him. “This is a referendum on norms, a referendum on a stolen seat,” Lithwick said, “and I always think these questions of ‘Are you a good person?’ as represented by these handful of behaviors never goes well. I’ve learned to call it sort of the cardiologic model of confirmation hearings.” Maddow came back at her friend to say she felt it is in no small measure a matter of White House and Gorsuch biographical integrity. But, on this matter, Lithwick seemed far closer to getting it right during what remained an insightful exchange. “I hope this is not the main event at a confirmation hearing that might be the last best chance to talk about an independent judiciary and Donald Trump.” Plus, the guy’s record on prisoner rights is good, she noted, so shift the focus in any interrogation to what he thinks of Trump calling somebody a “so-called judge” and on his view of an independent judiciary, not his volunteer work 25 years ago. Cheddar inks another partnership You do have to check Cheddar, the very good sort-of CNBC for a younger crowd, especially strong on the tech sector. It’s smart and fun and airs live for several hours from the New York Stock Exchange floor and Smart Flatiron Building in Manhattan. Now it will be on 60 percent of smart TVs in the U.S. as it launches on XUMO, the live and video-on-demand over-the-top digital service. It’s the first network on XUMO to boast live daily shows on XUMO. Says founder Jon Steinberg, “I want people to open up their TVs, connect to the Internet, and get a taste of Cheddar. With Xumo, we achieve that for 60 percent of the new smart TVs sold in the United States. Now everyone can get the free hours we provide on Facebook right on their TV.” Tiger Woods tanking What is the deal, at least to journalists who cover golf? After a long layoff, Woods returned and has been both miserable and, now, he’s injured again. Says Ed Sherman, a long-time golf writer who co-hosts a golf talk radio show on WSCR in Chicago: “The history of golf is full of great players who said they would stop playing when they were no longer competitive, and they continued to play. I would think Tiger Woods would be the same way, assuming his health allows. It might be his health won’t let him play anymore. The guy hasn’t played a full season since 2013. There is a lot of scar tissue. Plus, the Golf Channel’s Brandel Chamblee said he looked like the oldest 41-year old golfer he’s ever seen.” Adds Sherman, who also writes for Poynter, “Yet having said that, Woods is going to find inspiration from Darren Clarke, who won the 2011 British Open at age 42 when he was supposedly toast. He’s going to look at Davis Love III winning the 2015 Wyndham Championship at age 51 after suffering through years of injury problems. He has to be thinking if they can do, I can do it.” The morning babble “We get all these calls from people off the press, pushing this Bannon story,” said Joe Scarborough on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” pooh-poohing notion that Steve Bannon is running the show. Still, Donny Deutsch, the ad executive-turned-bloviator, claims that Bannon is “in the business of promoting Steve Bannon” and is a leaker par excellence, a “greater self-promoter than Trump.” Witness his mug on the current Time magazine profile. Fox & Friends went after a California state politician who said “half of my family would be eligible of deportation under the executive order.” As co-host Brian Kilmeade said, “Because they don’t belong here, they should be eligible for mass deportation” (though they doesn’t “think they’ll be targeted initially”). Steve Doocy jumped from that claim to suggest validity to Trump’s claim of million of illegal voters, though, “We don’t know the numbers.” CNN took us to the Senate floor, where Democrats had been blabbing all night themselves to delay a confirmation vote on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. As underscored, it was a “Hail Mary” pass to find a Republican to break a 50-450 tie. Well, this made it imperative to check out C-SPAN2 where Sen. Chuck Schumer was talking to a virtually empty chamber shortly before 6:30 a.m. Eastern. He was talking about Vladimir Putin and his inclination to “go to any lengths to silence political dissidents, including murder.” Its relevance to, say, charter schools was unclear but thankfully he gave way to solid, sober Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who is languorous even in the midday sun. He informed that Rhode Islanders don’t think billionaire DeVos understands working people. As he spoke, The Washington Post was offering a Dana Milbank column arguing that “Democrats in the long run may thank the majority Republicans for confirming DeVos. In the fight against President Trump’s agenda, the new administration’s incompetence is their friend.” The droning went on at C-Span2. Back at “Fox & Friends,” there was one of its quintessential B-list debates, on media coverage of Trump, with “journalist and author” Cathy Areu defending the press and The Federalist’s Bre Payton telling Doocy what he wanted to hear. Yes, yes, the press were “lapdogs” to president Obama and “now the reverse is true” as it “serves media elites and audiences.” All very pedestrian.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile 5 ways Android has taken Apple’s ideas and made them better Image Source: Ng Han Guan/AP/REX/Shutterstock Zach Epstein @zacharye February 7th, 2017 at 11:44 AM Share Tweet Apple’s iOS platform and Google’s Android platform both emerged at around the same time a decade ago, but there’s precious little question that one platform in particular was steering the ship in the early days. Google’s Android team had been hard at work building a boring BlackBerry clone, but Google did something that other platform makers failed at miserably. Google took one look at the iPhone Apple unveiled in early 2007 and it instantly knew it was cloning the wrong mobile experience. Meanwhile, big cell phone companies like Nokia, BlackBerry and Microsoft kept chugging along without adapting at all. Google’s reworked Android platform would launch commercially in late 2008 on the HTC Dream/G1, and it wisely resembled Apple’s iPhone far more than it resembled a BlackBerry phone. In the years that followed, Apple and Google would go on to overtake the global cell phone market as other platforms floundered and failed. It’s clear that iOS and Android took inspiration from each other every step of the way, but in this post we’ll look at five ways in particular that Android took Apple’s ideas from the iPhone and made them even better in Android. Don't Miss: The one way Android will never, ever be able to compete with the iPhone High-resolution displays Just like the touchscreen itself, high-resolution displays have become ubiquitous and as a result, it can be difficult to remember a time before smartphone displays became as sophisticated as they are right now. But it all began in 2010, when Apple started a pixel war with the Retina display on the iPhone 4. Today, nearly seven years later, Apple smartphones have the lowest resolution among all flagship devices. Now, it’s important to note that while Apple had been lagging far behind market leaders like Samsung for years when it comes to display quality, the screens on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have narrowed the gap substantially. Although resolution hasn’t improved on either device, other improvements and support for a wider color gamut have brought Apple’s iPhones closer in display quality to AMOLED panels from the likes of Samsung. App Store No, Android doesn’t have better apps than iOS. In fact, the gap in user experience and overall app quality between the two platforms is just as wide now as it has been for years. While Android affords developers far more flexibility, iOS apps are alway smoother and they offer a much more consistent experience. Where app stores are concerned, iOS and Android each have their pros and cons where app distribution is concerned — the Play Store is cluttered and confusing at times, while search is still awful in the iOS App Store — but there’s one area where Android just leapt ahead of Apple by a huge margin: Instant Apps. The new Instant Apps feature google unveiled last year during its annual I/O developer conference is a stroke of genius. In a nutshell, it allows developers to turn a portion of their apps into web apps that can be accessed instantly without any need to purchase or even download an application. So for example, a person can begin using a portion of a paid app instantly without making any purchase. Then, a purchase can be made if the person wants to keep using the app beyond a certain point. Quick Settings Android has always had some settings available in the pull-down “shade” menu, but it wasn’t until Apple’s Control Panel came around that Google stepped things up and created the versatile quick settings panel users enjoy today. Different vendors have made a wide range of tweaks to the Quick Settings menu in their various Android builds, but the endgame is the same: Users have easy access to a customizable menu that allows them to tweak more than a dozen settings from any screen. One of the most frustrating things about the Control Panel in iOS is that it is not customizable. So, if there are settings you access constantly that aren’t included in the Control Panel, you’re just out of luck. Android, meanwhile, has a much wider range of settings that are accessible on the Quick Settings menu. What’s more, the menu is customizable so you can remove settings you don’t often use, add settings you want to be able to configure, and rearrange items in any order of your choosing. Keyboards Apple’s virtual keyboard on the iPhone was a complete game changer, but there’s little question that Apple has been lapped at this point. First and foremost, third-party keyboard support in iOS is still horrendous. Apple’s keyboard offers a terrific typing experience thanks to a great design and class-leading touch response on iPhones and iPads, but people often want more than that. For example, swipe-style typing is hugely popular and Apple’s keyboard doesn’t support it. There are also third-party keyboard with better emoji functionality and dozens of other features that are nowhere to be found on the built-in iOS keyboard. But third-party options are severely constrained, keyboard support is buggy at best. Android, meanwhile, has a terrific built-in keyboard but it also gives third-party developers the freedom to access all of the OS features and functions they want. The result is a keyboard experience that feels and functions like a fully integrated OEM keyboard. Software Updates Software updates? Really?! Apple still gets updates out faster since it releases updates directly to end users rather than to vendor partners, but Android Nougat’s new update mechanism is brilliant. Instead of having to stop everything you’re doing to update your smartphone running Android 7.0 or later, software updates are downloaded in the background over Wi-Fi while you use the phone. Once the download is complete, everything still happens in the background because the new Android build installs to a special separate partition. Then, the next time the phone is rebooted, the new software version boots and the update it done — that’s it.

 Google Home makes a play for mass appeal with Super Bowl ads BI Intelligence Feb. 7, 2017, 11:36 AM 1,241 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Tech giants take on each other in the smart home The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] $1.9 trillion dollars of economic value could be created by the use of IoT devices and asset tracking solutions This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Many consumers still view smart home devices as expensive, gimmicky, and difficult to use, and the market has remained stagnant as a result. But Google and other companies that produce voice-activated speakers appear to be making an effort to change this perception, as evidenced by the numerous Google Home ads featured during Super Bowl LI this past weekend. This is one of the first times a large number of consumers were exposed to the Home, which could potentially drive adoption of not only the speaker, but also the smart home more broadly. Once consumers see the smart home as more than just a luxury, they'll likely begin to purchase connected devices and build out their ecosystems, especially if they already have a voice-activated speaker like the Google Home or Amazon Echo. Here’s what Google is trying to do through its promotion of the Home: Google is primarily aiming to bring the smart home to mainstream consumers through these ads. With ownership of smart home devices remaining low and not growing quickly, these ads are an effort to expose smart home products to mainstream consumers. These consumers have not adopted the smart home en masse, and they still see such devices as a luxury rather than a utility. Large-scale ads, however, are the first step toward shifting consumer attitudes. Once consumers have these devices in their homes, they'll likely want to take full advantage of their utility and purchase other connected devices to build out a full ecosystem. But Google also wants to eat into Amazon’s increasingly dominant market share in the voice-activated speaker market. While the Google Home has gained more abilities after opening to third-party developers late last year, the Echo product line has retained a dominant market share. The low price point of the Dot led to the device being very popular during the holiday season, and the device’s install base drastically increased over the past few months, as Slice Intelligence noted in a recent report. Google hopes to make the Home just as popular as the Echo line, though as BI Intelligence has previously identified, this process will take some time and not be easy for the company. Overall, these ads point to the role that voice can play in triggering smart home adoption. Voice-activated speakers can be found in a growing number of homes not just because of the convenience and utility they offer, but also because they're now available at lower price points — the Echo Dot, for example, retails at about $50, and the Google Home retails at about $129.99, versus $179.99 for an original Echo. Further, as device prices come down and device replacement cycles are slowly overcome, consumers could be even more willing to integrate smart home solutions into their lives, something BI Intelligence argued as early as 2015. As the smart home continues to mature, consumers will increasingly look to pair inexpensive devices with their voice-activated speakers, a phenomenon that will fuel adoption into the mass-market phase. The U.S. smart home market has yet to truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption. There are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home. John Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Smart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the "chasm" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. "Closed ecosystems" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady after winning Super Bowl LI as seen in the Fox Sports VR app. Image: fox sports VR By Adario Strange2017-02-07 16:24:57 UTC Opinion A funny thing happened on the way to my futuristic dive into the Super Bowl in virtual reality — it never happened.  Yes, I have my own, fancy Oculus Rift set up along with a pricey high-spec computer to help me immerse myself in the virtual waters of everything from gaming to animation and, I thought, sports events. SEE ALSO: Facebook's VR social network is surprisingly stunning But it turns out that Fox Sports, in its mainstream content wisdom, decided to offer its VR presentation of the Super Bowl exclusively on the Samsung Gear VR version of the Oculus store, and not the Oculus store for the Oculus Rift.  I know I speak for my Rift brethren out there when I say, WTF?  Focusing on the wrong users At first I thought maybe this had something to do with the mobile VR app Fox Sports developed being perhaps too lightweight and not high-resolution enough for the high-end environment provided by the Rift, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Not only is the Fox Sports VR Super Bowl presentation insanely well-designed, the app, its interface and its array of video and data offerings look about as good as any non-gaming content I've seen on the Rift.  The virtual VIP box framing the Fox Sports Super Bowl LI VR experience. Image: fox sports vr Now, a couple of days later, after I've plumbed the depths of the app, I'm here to say that there's simply no excuse for this amazingly well done, immersive sports experience to not be available to people who have paid upwards of $2,000 to equip themselves with the best available VR.  Yes, we know that there are far more people who own mobile VR headsets like the Gear VR, Cardboard and now Google's Daydream View. Mobile VR is great, but at this point, focusing on it over high-end VR headset users is like walking into Walmart and passing out Hamilton fliers — you'll get a few bites, but you're not reaching people who know and care about the Broadway musical. One of the many interactive game stats screens available in the Fox Sports Super Bowl LI VR experience. Image: Fox Sports vr Denying passionate VR lovers access to a huge VR event like the Super Bowl doesn't make any sense: Oculus users don't necessarily own or even want a low-end headset, plus they may or may not be on Android (the only phones that work with Gear VR or Daydream View). So the result is VR's most loyal users are cut out of the biggest thing happening in the medium. Who thought that was as good idea? Similarly, the premiere of 24: Legacy, which aired on the same network just after the Super Bowl, also had an incredibly well produced VR experience ("The Raid"). Yep. You guessed it. It's only available on the Gear VR.  A scene from 24 Legacy 'The Raid' on the Samsung Gear VR. Image: Samsung VR So, just to make sure you're keeping up, here's what VR users were presented with on Sunday: 1. The Fox Sports VR app is available on Oculus store for Gear VR, but not the Oculus store for Oculus Rift.  2. The 24 Legacy "The Raid" app is only available on Samsung VR app, but to get "that" app you must first download the mobile Oculus app. And no, you can't get any version of "The Raid" app on the Oculus store for the Oculus Rift.  Did you catch that? It's almost like a riddle. (In which the answer is: Do I actually care this much?) Not. Confusing. At. All.  And while this might seem like a one-off event, I've encountered this time and again over the past year when it comes to VR experiences. It seems in their rush to capitalize on the still mostly uncooked world of mobile VR, many major VR productions are simply bypassing high-end VR headset owners (including the Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR) altogether.  Case in point: The NBA's VR production partner, NextVR, remains solely focused (for now) on mobile VR like the Gear VR and Google Daydream, instead of serving the needs of the most dedicated consumers who have invested the most in this emerging technology.  Who's to blame? "It's ultimately up to the developer in terms of what platforms they are building for, whether that be on Rift or Gear VR," an Oculus spokesperson said, after I asked about the uneven distribution of certain apps and experiences between the Gear VR and the Rift. "Often times, there are developers who choose to bring their apps to Gear VR first as it’s the more accessible option for a wider variety of people who may not be invested in the higher-end VR experience yet. Mobile is still the best entry into VR for a person who may not want a full PC setup just yet given it’s still a new technology." VR is still a fledgling technology that needs to lean on the users who support it the most fervently. That approach might make sense if your strategy is simply focused on capturing the most eyeballs possible by any means necessary, but VR is still a fledgling technology that needs to lean on the users who support it the most fervently. Instead, major VR productions are treating the medium as though it's just another app.  But it's not. VR is different.  Whether the experience is sports, gaming or social, VR demands more engagement from the user than any other software experience, and that experience has to be delivered in just the right way, with high quality, or you'll lose an otherwise enthusiastic future VR user.   The small team at Viacom NEXT (a VR-focused team within the broadcast giant) appears to understand this dynamic. Recently, I had the opportunity to experience the team's immersive music video "Chocolate," directed by Tyler Hurd, which premiered at Sundance in January. Rather than pumping the incredibly well-produced VR music video to as many people as possible on mobile VR platforms, the team is focusing (for now) on delivering it to the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive in the coming months. A scene from the VR music video "Chocolate." Image: viacom next "It's a shortsighted decision to prioritize mobile VR," says Rob Ruffler, senior director at Viacom NEXT. "I think it's shortsighted because it's prioritizing the wrong things. The priority today in VR should not be, 'How many people can I get to view this thing, but how good is the experience for the people that do view it." If major VR studios are wondering why more people aren't already singing the praises of VR, I present to them at least one major clue: You guys are making things unnecessarily complicated by muddying the distribution waters and focusing on VR tourists (aka non-sticky mobile users) over dedicated, high-end VR users.  If you want to make mainstream VR successful, holster your greed and focus less on becoming the dominant platform early in the game and spend more time on making it easy to experience incredible VR content.  The new lesson of VR is an old one: content is (still) king…but only if you can find it.   BONUS: This VR paint studio allows you to collaborate live with anyone in the world Topics: 24: legacy, fox sports, fox sports vr, Gear VR, NBA, nextvr, Oculus, samsung gear vr, Super Bowl, Tech, virtual reality, VR About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

It'll now provide real-time updates directly on the app's main screen, Google announced in a blog post on Monday.  SEE ALSO: Google Maps will soon get you where you need to go, then help you park The bottom bar of Google Maps now shows three tabs: Places, Driving and Transit. The Places tab will help you explore food and drink options near you. It includes curated lists like "cheap eats," "best dinners" and more. You can also search for amenities, like pharmacies and ATMs. Image: google The Driving and Transit tabs include shortcuts to your home and work addresses, if you have them set up. Driving incorporates local traffic reports and a shortcut to "driving mode," if you don't need directions. Transit has also been enhanced to include bus and train stations nearby and give real-time schedule options.  Image: google Image: google While Google Maps is currently great at efficiently getting you to your destination, you may still need to use other apps like Yelp to help you decide where to go. But the company has been making a number of updates to better inform you of your options, including incorporating restaurant reviews and multiple transit schedule options.  More recently, Google added features to help you avoid crowds and find parking.  Tuesday's update is another step forward. By trying to guess what you might need and offer you answers before you ask questions, the new Maps experience is much slicker and faster than before.  The update is currently on Android and will be rolling out to users this week.  BONUS: This device can make any pair of headphones wireless Topics: Android, google maps, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

[Denis Linine / Shutterstock, Inc.]    Google Dumps Money Into Immigration Fight Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 11:41 AM 02/07/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5466156 Google parent company Alphabet is spearheading the funding efforts for the legal brief signed by nearly 100 companies objecting to President Donald Trump’s temporary immigration ban. Alphabet is working with a Washington, D.C.-based law firm on the amicus (or “friend of the court”) brief, according to Bloomberg. An amicus brief is a legal document that is officially filed by parties not involved in the case, but have a direct interest in the subject at hand. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit preserved a lower judge’s order to temporarily stop the executive order on restricting immigration, the Trump administration filed an appeal to quickly reverse the stoppage. Ninety-seven companies — the majority of them from the tech industry — then coalesced to file a brief opposing Trump’s appeal. They argue the executive order is illegal and economically wrong for the country. “These companies’ operations are affected by the Executive Order,” the official Amici Curiae brief reads. “The Order represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than fifty years–and the Order inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth as a result.” Participants of the legal brief included Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Uber, and many others. (RELATED: There’s A Quantifiable Reason Why Uber’s CEO Quit Trump’s Econ Team) Google’s decision to lead the way on the coordination front of combating Trump’s executive order isn’t very surprising, since the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Eric Schmidt, was an unabashed supporter of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Schmidt even told company employees at a weekly meeting that he thought the Trump administration is “going to do these evil things.” (RELATED: Facebook Employees Are Boycotting Air Travel Over Trump’s Immigration Ban) The tech conglomerate isn’t just helping to fund the legal action. Google is also financing a crisis fund for four organizations that are battling the Trump administration’s executive orders and providing assistance to refugees and immigrants. The company put $2 million into the reserve, which can be matched with up to $2 million in donations from employees, according to USA Today.

The name beam is a combination of Batch and strEAM. Beam aims to enable efficient execution across a number of distributed execution engines. It consists of a programming model, SDKs, and runners for defining and executing data processing pipelines. Apache Top Level Projects are the highest status in the Apache Foundation. Before achieving this status, a project has to go through an incubator period. Apache Beam was jointly proposed by Google, Talend, Cloudera, dataArtisans, PayPal and Slack as an Apache Incubator back in February 2016. Beam began life at Google, and is used as the Google Cloud Dataflow (GCD) service. Beam uses the same API as GCD. You can implement data processes using Beam via a Beam SDK. There are currently only two - Java and Python, with plans for a Scala SDK to be added in the future. Having chosen your SDK, you implement your data processes as Beam Pipelines. These are translated to the runtime where your processes will be deployed and run by Apache Beam runners.There are four runners available at the moment, for Apache Apex (aimed at Hadoop deployments), Apache Spark (Apache's main open source data processing engine), Apache Flink (a stream processing engine designed to be very memory efficient), and Google Cloud Dataflow. Plans are underway for runners for Apache Hadoop MapReduce, and Apache Karaf. A typical pipeline is shown below: The advantages Beam offers are portability and unified processing. The portability comes from the decoupling of the data processing job and the runtime on which it will be executed. You can use the same code with a different runner and it will execute on the new backend without changes. The unified processing means you can use the same unified model for batch and stream processing. One interesting thing about Beam is how it offers a competitor to Spark. All the data processing engines supported by Beam are rivals for market share, and Spark is currently out in front because of the number of libraries and user acceptance. If Beam can provide a more engine agnostic approach, it could become the obvious choice when creating a data process to access big data.

Google’s Android team had been hard at work building a boring BlackBerry clone, but Google did something that other platform makers failed at miserably. Google took one look at the iPhone Apple unveiled in early 2007 and it instantly knew it was cloning the wrong mobile experience. Meanwhile, big cell phone companies like Nokia, BlackBerry and Microsoft kept chugging along without adapting at all. Google’s reworked Android platform would launch commercially in late 2008 on the HTC Dream/G1, and it wisely resembled Apple’s iPhone far more than it resembled a BlackBerry phone. In the years that followed, Apple and Google would go on to overtake the global cell phone market as other platforms floundered and failed. It’s clear that iOS and Android took inspiration from each other every step of the way, but in this post we’ll look at five ways in particular that Android took Apple’s ideas from the iPhone and made them even better in Android. Don't Miss: The one way Android will never, ever be able to compete with the iPhone High-resolution displays Just like the touchscreen itself, high-resolution displays have become ubiquitous and as a result, it can be difficult to remember a time before smartphone displays became as sophisticated as they are right now. But it all began in 2010, when Apple started a pixel war with the Retina display on the iPhone 4. Today, nearly seven years later, Apple smartphones have the lowest resolution among all flagship devices. Now, it’s important to note that while Apple had been lagging far behind market leaders like Samsung for years when it comes to display quality, the screens on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have narrowed the gap substantially. Although resolution hasn’t improved on either device, other improvements and support for a wider color gamut have brought Apple’s iPhones closer in display quality to AMOLED panels from the likes of Samsung. App Store No, Android doesn’t have better apps than iOS. In fact, the gap in user experience and overall app quality between the two platforms is just as wide now as it has been for years. While Android affords developers far more flexibility, iOS apps are alway smoother and they offer a much more consistent experience. Where app stores are concerned, iOS and Android each have their pros and cons where app distribution is concerned — the Play Store is cluttered and confusing at times, while search is still awful in the iOS App Store — but there’s one area where Android just leapt ahead of Apple by a huge margin: Instant Apps. The new Instant Apps feature google unveiled last year during its annual I/O developer conference is a stroke of genius. In a nutshell, it allows developers to turn a portion of their apps into web apps that can be accessed instantly without any need to purchase or even download an application. So for example, a person can begin using a portion of a paid app instantly without making any purchase. Then, a purchase can be made if the person wants to keep using the app beyond a certain point. Quick Settings Android has always had some settings available in the pull-down “shade” menu, but it wasn’t until Apple’s Control Panel came around that Google stepped things up and created the versatile quick settings panel users enjoy today. Different vendors have made a wide range of tweaks to the Quick Settings menu in their various Android builds, but the endgame is the same: Users have easy access to a customizable menu that allows them to tweak more than a dozen settings from any screen. One of the most frustrating things about the Control Panel in iOS is that it is not customizable. So, if there are settings you access constantly that aren’t included in the Control Panel, you’re just out of luck. Android, meanwhile, has a much wider range of settings that are accessible on the Quick Settings menu. What’s more, the menu is customizable so you can remove settings you don’t often use, add settings you want to be able to configure, and rearrange items in any order of your choosing. Read More Keyboards Apple’s virtual keyboard on the iPhone was a complete game changer, but there’s little question that Apple has been lapped at this point. First and foremost, third-party keyboard support in iOS is still horrendous. Apple’s keyboard offers a terrific typing experience thanks to a great design and class-leading touch response on iPhones and iPads, but people often want more than that. For example, swipe-style typing is hugely popular and Apple’s keyboard doesn’t support it. There are also third-party keyboard with better emoji functionality and dozens of other features that are nowhere to be found on the built-in iOS keyboard. But third-party options are severely constrained, keyboard support is buggy at best. Android, meanwhile, has a terrific built-in keyboard but it also gives third-party developers the freedom to access all of the OS features and functions they want. The result is a keyboard experience that feels and functions like a fully integrated OEM keyboard. Software Updates Software updates? Really?! Apple still gets updates out faster since it releases updates directly to end users rather than to vendor partners, but Android Nougat’s new update mechanism is brilliant. Instead of having to stop everything you’re doing to update your smartphone running Android 7.0 or later, software updates are downloaded in the background over Wi-Fi while you use the phone. Once the download is complete, everything still happens in the background because the new Android build installs to a special separate partition. Then, the next time the phone is rebooted, the new software version boots and the update it done — that’s it.

SAN FRANCISCO — Through a Super Bowl ad, public statements and court filings, Silicon Valley's biggest companies are taking a strong stand against President Trump's travel ban, saying high tech needs immigrants' creativity and energy to stay competitive. Although the companies are risking a backlash from customers who side with Trump, they say the pushback is necessary for an industry dependent on thousands of highly skilled foreign workers. About 58 percent of the engineers and other high-skill employees in Silicon Valley were born outside the United States, according to the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, an industry trade group. “Immigration and innovation go hand in hand,” said Carl Guardino, the group's CEO. “This cuts so deeply into the bone and marrow of what fuels the innovation economy that very few CEOs feel the luxury of sitting on the sidelines. So people are going to stand up and speak up.” The tech industry contends there aren't enough Americans with the specialized skills these companies need. The ban, tech companies contend, would make hiring even tougher and pressure them to move some operations abroad. “A lot of these companies will really struggle if all of a sudden we turn off the spigot,” said Greg Morrisett, dean of Cornell University's Computing and Information Science school. In a court filing late Sunday against the ban, 97 companies, including such major tech players as Google, Apple, Microsoft, eBay, Netflix, Facebook and Twitter, also spoke of the entrepreneurial spirit of “people who choose to leave everything that is familiar and journey to an unknown land to make a new life.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella both came from India. Google co-founder Sergey Brin is a Russian refugee who moved to the United States as a boy. The father of Apple's late co-founder, Steve Jobs, immigrated from Syria. The Silicon Valley Leadership Group estimates that half the companies in the region were co-founded by an immigrant or are now led by a CEO from outside the country. In signing an executive order Jan. 27 that would temporarily ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries, Trump said he was trying to protect Americans by preventing terrorists from slipping into the country. The administration says the president has the constitutional authority to decide who can enter. During the Super Bowl, several companies ran ads that promoted diversity and inclusion, as marketers tried to reach both sides of a consumer base roiled by the election. One of the most overtly political was from Airbnb, a company that matches travelers with places to stay. The San Francisco company showed close-ups of people with different ethnicities. A narrator says: “We believe no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept.” Airbnb followed up with a campaign to provide short-term housing over the next five years for 100,000 people in need, starting with refugees, disaster survivors and relief workers. The company said it will donate $4 million over four years to the International Rescue Committee, joining many tech brethren in making financial contributions. Google set up a $4 million “crisis fund” in January to support organizations that are helping immigrants and refugees, while ride-hailing service Lyft pledged $1 million over the next four years to the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups challenging the ban. Workers from Google and Comcast have staged walkouts over the restriction. “I wouldn't be where I am today or have any kind of life that I have today if this was not a brave country that really stood out and spoke for liberty,” Brin told a crowd of Google employees who walked out in protest last week. Tech companies risk alienating the many Americans who support Trump and his policies. But the risk is lower than that of, say, a company that makes consumer products with plenty of alternatives. It's much harder to boycott a Facebook or Google, where you have friends or your email address, said digital marketing analyst Rebecca Lieb. She added that people are less likely to toss out a $2,000 laptop or pricey mobile phone than change soft drinks. In fact, tech companies might be more wary of backlash from the anti-Trump side. Last week, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit Trump's council of business leaders after an outcry from Uber customers and employees who were upset about the ban. In addition, most tech companies have operations around the world and risk alienating customers abroad if they stay silent. “We interact with a large global ecosystem and our businesses would not be here or be able to thrive without it,” said Aaron Levie, CEO of Box Inc., an online storage service. “So our businesses are extremely sensitive, by default, to things that affect immigration and things that affect our relationship with the broader world.” More Nation/World Sacrificing California spillway may avoid emergency releases Appeals court OKs NYC salt-warning rule for some restaurants Official: $4B bond meant as jab at trend of exorbitant bonds Trump considers writing 'brand new' immigration order After Louvre attack, France foils another terrorist plot TribLIVE commenting policy You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

It replaces the company’s old OnHub device, and has the potential to revolutionize home Wi-Fi. Its combination of cutting-edge technology and stylish design means it’s able to tackle all the problems you normally associate with wireless routers. If you’re struggling with home Wi-Fi, then read on because this may be the solution you’ve been waiting for. Google Wifi and Mesh Networks Google Wifi taps into the trend of mesh networking Are Mesh Nets The Future of The Internet? Are Mesh Nets The Future of The Internet? Mesh nets are powerful decentralized networks that may change the way we use the internet. Here's how they work.

In this article, you’ll learn more about the new type of Wi-Fi system for the home and hear more about three of the most talked about Wi-Fi mesh products on the market, Eero, Google Wifi,... Read More . It’s different than a normal network where you get a direct connection between point A and point B — your phone to your router, for instance. A mesh network contains a “mesh” of interconnected devices (or “nodes”) that are capable of relaying data back and forth to destinations. Instead of that singular connection, you instead connect to the nearest node in the mesh and the data is always transmitted via the shortest, fastest, or most efficient route through the mesh. In the case of a Google Wifi network, it means you get a main router plus additional puck-like devices that act as wireless access points around your home. They give you much better coverage (both in terms of range and performance) and are seen as a single network: you only need to enter the password once to connect to any node on the network. You can achieve similar results using a Wi-Fi extender Wi-Fi Extenders vs. Powerline Adapters: How to Fix Poor Wireless Signals Wi-Fi Extenders vs. Powerline Adapters: How to Fix Poor Wireless Signals If your router's Wi-Fi signals are weak and unreliable and you can't seem to find a solution, the answer may lie in Wi-Fi extenders and/or powerline adapters. Read More , but it’s more complicated to set up and you often have to connect to each router separately. Google Wifi Gives You Better Coverage The immediate benefit of Google Wifi is that it can give you better wireless coverage throughout your home. Google Wifi is available in two options. The single unit has a range of 1,500 feet and is fine for an apartment. The three-pack covers 4,500 feet and is ideal if you need your Wi-Fi coverage to extend upstairs or out into the yard. You can add even more range if you live in a particularly large house. With the three-pack, you’re able to position each Wi-Fi point around your home to achieve maximum coverage: one at the front of the house, one at the back, and one upstairs, for example. The Wifi app will even help with optimal positioning to ensure you have no dead zones (areas where there’s no signal at all). And because a mesh network treats every Wi-Fi point as part of the same network, you only need one ID and password for the whole house. Google Wifi Gives You Faster Speeds Setting up a normal Wi-Fi router is a fine art Wireless Feng Shui: How to Optimize Your House For Best Wi-Fi Reception Wireless Feng Shui: How to Optimize Your House For Best Wi-Fi Reception Setting up a Wi-Fi network should be an easy prospect, shouldn't it? I mean, a house is a closed-in box, and you'd think when you place a device that transmits wireless signals in all directions... Read More . The further a signal has to travel, and the more physical obstacles (such as walls) it has to pass through, the weaker the signal becomes. This is not an issue on mesh networks where you have multiple Wi-Fi points. With a Google Wifi setup, your devices always connect to the nearest node. As you move around the house, your devices seamlessly disconnect from one and reconnect to another. As a result, you always have the fastest and most stable connection available, which is rarely true with a single router setup. That’s not to say that there’s no speed loss when you connect several nodes together. You just won’t notice the effect because each node is still faster than your internet connection (unless you have a very fast connection in excess of 250 Mbps). Google Wifi Is Simple to Set Up Mesh networking sounds complicated, but in the case of Google Wifi it could hardly be simpler. The system is effectively plug and play. After setting up the first Wi-Fi point, the others auto-detect and auto-connect to the network. You don’t need to configure individual routers like you do when you use a Wi-Fi extender. Actual usage of Google Wifi is easy as well. Where you’d normally have to delve into a router’s settings 10 Things You Must Do With a Brand New Router 10 Things You Must Do With a Brand New Router Whether you just bought your first ever router or upgraded your old one to a new one, there are several crucial first steps that you should take right away to set up properly. Read More to choose the best channel and band, each point on the Google Wifi network does this automatically. They are constantly scanning and switching channels and bands to give you the fastest, most interference-free connection. Google Wifi Is Controlled by App To use Google Wifi, you need to have the mobile app installed on your iPhone or Android phone. As well as helping you to get set up and add other Wi-Fi points, the app gives you full control over your network: Give bandwidth priority to specific devices to get the best speeds when you need them, such as when watching Netflix in 4K on your TV. See what devices are connected to your network and how much bandwidth they’re using. Set up a guest password for your friends. Connect and control select smart home devices.

However, thanks to IFTTT, one can streamline many of these processes so that they all become connected to one another. Read More that give you control over your network. Google Wifi Even Looks Great It may seem trivial, but the attractive design of Google Wifi serves as another benefit. Most routers are ugly boxes with flashing lights and antennas poking out in various directions — they’re just asking to be tucked away in a corner or hidden behind a plant pot, which can actually hinder your Wi-Fi speeds How to Fix a Slow or Unstable Wi-Fi Connection How to Fix a Slow or Unstable Wi-Fi Connection One simple trick could speed up your Wi-Fi connection. We explain the issue, how to analyze Wi-Fi networks around you, and how to use the information to speed up your Wi-Fi connection. Read More . The clean, understated puck-style design of the Google Wifi units means they can happily be hidden in plain sight on shelves, desks, or even kitchen worktops. You won’t even know they’re there. It’ll free you up to position them wherever they perform best. The Pros and Cons of Google Wifi Naturally there are a few downsides you need to be aware of as well: You need an Android or an iPhone to use it. You must have, and be connected to, a Google account. Not everyone will be okay with that How Much Does Google Really Know About You? How Much Does Google Really Know About You? Read More . Google Wifi does collect some data about your usage of the product, but this does not include the websites you visit or the content of any traffic. It is more expensive than most routers and methods of speeding up your Wi-Fi network. It doesn’t give you the most advanced features available on other routers. But in pretty much every other respect, it’s a big leap forward. Google Wifi hits the sweet spot between power and ease of use. It’s probably better than the router you’re currently using and is accessible enough for anyone who isn’t confident about setting up their tech. Have you got Google Wifi, or are you planning to get it? Share your thoughts on the service in the comments.

This involved caching the most popular responses to common terms, preloading them in the background and then serving them instantly when you clicked on them on the search page. AMP'd links are highlighted in a separate section at the top in mobile search and always load instantly. However, due to the way it works, the AMP links have an altered URL which isn't very good for sharing purposes. Moreover, getting the original URL of the page was a bit of a hassle and not something most people would be able to do. To solve this, Google will now show a link button in the header bar of all the AMP pages which will serve the canonical URL of the page you are viewing, free from the bits of Google URL that you find in the AMP links. Google has also updated the Google app for iOS to let you share the original URL instead of the AMP URL when you use the share function. This will be available in the Android version of the Google app soon. Going forward, Google will also enable sharing the original URL of the page in the mobile browser using the platform's native sharing interface.

The company is focusing on the "worst of the worst" offenders and partnering with outside fact-checkers to sort honest news reports from made-up stories that play to people's passions and preconceived notions. (Facebook via AP) PARIS (AP) — French journalists are teaming up with American internet giants Google and Facebook to fight propaganda and misinformation online, mirroring similar efforts already underway in the United States and Germany. French daily Le Monde says it is one of eight media organizations working with social networking site Facebook to fact-check questionable content ahead of France’s upcoming presidential election. At the same time, nonprofit First Draft News said Monday it was working with Google’s News Lab is to launch CrossCheck , a verification project aimed at helping French voters “make sense of what and who to trust online.” Google and Facebook have been under increasing scrutiny over their role in speeding the spread of hoaxes, conspiracy theories and propaganda — sometimes referred to by the catchall term “fake news.” Related: Facebook takes aim at fake news with new ‘trending’ formula There’s an argument that fake news helped secure the victory of Donald Trump, whose false allegations about former President Barack Obama helped lay the foundation for his own run for high office. Recent research has questioned the impact of propaganda and hoaxes, but with France’s election only two-and-a-half months away, media-watchers here are anxious to avoid a rerun. “We’ll see a real wave of fake news in the coming days,” said Alain Rabatel, a professor of linguistics at the University of Lyon 1 who has written about fact-checking in French journalism. Le Monde said Monday that its collaboration was “an experiment,” noting that the French media were leery of participating in a stunt to help burnish Silicon Valley firms’ reputations — and that remuneration would have to be discussed if the project kept going. In a telephone interview, Rabatel had guarded praise, saying journalists had to be more than just fact-checkers. “I think it’s good,” he said. “It’s not sufficient.” Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Conner/Getty Images By Erika Owen Posted February 07, 2017 Learning a new language is hard. And if there's a new alphabet involved—like there is with Japanese for English-speaking travelers—it's even harder. But technology is here to help. Google announced on Thursday a new translation feature that will make it easier for travelers who don't speak the language to go on a trip to a Japanese-speaking destination. Google Word Lens—a service available through Google Translate on Android and iOS devices—allows you to point your phone's camera at text, and it'll show the translation on the screen in real time. “The Google Translate app already lets you snap a photo of Japanese text and get a translation for it in English,” Masakazu Seno, a software engineer for Google Translate, wrote. “But it’s a whole lot more convenient if you can just point your camera and instantly translate text on the go.” RELATED Why Do Airplanes Dim Lights on Takeoff? How to Rent Camera Lenses Before Your Next Trip Travel Laundry Detergent Solutions for Messy Travelers The app offers translation for hundreds of languages, and the most recent addition to the live translation is Japanese. The app works offline, so you don't need to have a Wi-Fi connection to use it, but you will need to download a file for each language you'd like to translate. For any languages that aren't included in the live functionality, you can still take a photo of the text in the app and highlight what you want translated. It doesn't get easier than that. Well, unless you're wearing that handy "translation T-shirt." This article originally appeared on Travel + Leisure.

Through donations of time, talent, and resources, business leaders can have a direct, positive impact on improving student proficiency and ultimately strengthening the region’s ability to attract new businesses in the future. LAS VEGAS (PRWEB) February 07, 2017 Nevada business owners and executives are joining Southern Nevada’s leading business organizations to support effective educational programs, improved student outcomes, and create a pathway to a more diverse economy in Southern Nevada at this year’s Business + Education (BE) Engaged Summit 2017. The summit, which takes place on Wednesday, March 29, 2017 from 7:30 a.m. – 1 p.m., at The Smith Center, seeks business participation and support of educational improvements through commitments of time, talent or resources. The Business + Education (BE) Engaged Summit 2017 is a direct invitation to Southern Nevada’s business leaders to become involved in solutions which are improving the public education system. Through donations of time, talent, and resources, business leaders can have a direct, positive impact on improving student proficiency and ultimately strengthening the region’s ability to attract new businesses in the future. The event this year is again co-sponsored by a diverse group of business organizations, including: The Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance (LVGEA), Las Vegas Metro Chamber, Henderson Chamber of Commerce, Latin Chamber of Commerce, Urban Chamber of Commerce, Asian Chamber of Commerce as well as the Council for a Better Nevada and The Smith Center for the Performing Arts. Corporate sponsors include Bank of Nevada, Station Casinos and VegasPBS. The 2017 BE Engaged program will again focus on specific areas of need within the public educational system, and the possible solutions to address those needs. This year’s discussion topics will include a “Workforce Report Card” presentation by the LVGEA that clearly illustrates the important relationship between education and economic development; attracting business leaders as mentors for public school principals dealing with material organizational and cultural changes under AB 394, the Clark County School District reorganization plan; early literacy programs that are improving reading and comprehension proficiency; and efforts to expand Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) curriculum in Nevada. Immediately following the BE Engaged main program, and before a keynote luncheon presentation by Google’s Jaime Casap, business leaders will have the opportunity to network with Nevada nonprofit executives, who will also be seated at each table, and will illustrate their specific programs which are addressing unmet educational needs and improving student outcomes. Many of these programs could expand educational improvements to a wider student population with additional support from business leaders. Google Chief Education Evangelist, Jaime Casap, will be the luncheon’s keynote speaker. Casap was part of the original team that launched Google Apps for universities and K-12 classrooms. As Chief Education Evangelist, Casap brings awareness to the power and potential of the web, technology and Google tools to create powerful learning models. Born and raised as a first generation American to a single mother on welfare in Hell’s Kitchen, New York, Jaime fully understands the power that education has on changing the destiny of a family in just one generation. Now in its second year, The Business + Education (BE) Engaged Summit is led by a team of volunteer community and business leaders, and nonprofit organizations that understand improving educational performance is essential to the growth of Nevada’s economy. “The strength and success of Nevada’s K-12 education system are directly linked to a business owner’s decision on whether to relocate or expand in our state,” said John Guedry, Bank of Nevada CEO. “As members of the business community, we must be part of the solution in improving our public education system to the level it needs to be. As business leaders, we must be involved in finding solutions to improve student achievement and expect graduates who are career or college ready.” Last year’s inaugural BE Engaged Summit resulted in a $1.4 million in-kind donation of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) curriculum and teacher training for Nevada’s public middle schools by the STEM Academy, Inc. Furthermore, many of Nevada’s businesses have partnered providing funding and mentoring commitments in support of nonprofit programs which are addressing educational gaps and leading to improvement in student performance. “In the past, the LVGEA led Southern Nevada’s business community in efforts to reform Nevada’s and Clark County’s educational system, to create the competent workforce that businesses demand and that families moving to our region deserve,” said John Delikanakis, Chairman of the LVGEA Board of Directors. “The LVGEA looks forward to a continued leading role in that effort.” “The Las Vegas Metro Chamber, as the largest business organization in Nevada, has been at the forefront for decades for advocating at the local, state and federal levels for the policies, funding and accountability necessary to improve education for the benefit of students and employers. The Metro Chamber is proud to join with other members of the business community as we work together to do our part to ensure our students are workforce ready, now and into the future,” says Bill Noonan, 2017 chairman of the Metro Chamber and senior vice president of Governmental and Industry Affairs with Boyd Gaming. Tickets for the event can be purchased by calling The Smith Center box office at (702) 749-2000 or going online to http://www.TheSmithCenter.com The cost is $20 per ticket for the BE Engaged program. A separate VIP luncheon, limited to 500 guests, is $50 per person. Ticket price includes VIP luncheon and seating for the morning’s BE Engaged program.

Among those taking part in the Pi day protest put on by Tech Stands Up To Trump are employees from Facebook, Apple and Google. Similar anti-Trump rallies are being organized in Los Angeles and Austin, pointing to growing grassroots activism among the rank-and-file in the tech industry. USA TODAY 127 companies now support brief opposing Trump ban "Are you a tech worker or tech user that is upset that our leaders are mysteriously quiet about Donald Trump? On March 14th, Pi day, let's show our tech leaders that they can not have their cake and eat it too," the Facebook page reads. "We are calling for all workers of companies that have either supported Trump, sat back and said nothing, or have been too worried about their stock price to say anything to walk out at 12 p.m. on March 14th. We have to force the hand of these extremely powerful individuals to stand up publicly for what is right." USA TODAY Google employees stage worldwide walkout over Trump edict Software engineer Brad Taylor told Axios he created Tech Stands Up after the tech industry's muted response to Trump's immigration ban. Nearly 100 tech companies on Sunday night filed a legal brief opposing the ban. USA TODAY Comcast employees stage anti-Trump immigration rallies Tech leaders are being pressured by employees to use their platforms to speak out against Trump administration policies. Last week, about 2,000 Google employees walked off the job to protest Trump. Comcast employees also walked out last week in Philadelphia. Catherine Bracy, co-founder of techequity.us, last week launched techresistance.org "to help provide some scaffolding for all this new civic consciousness among techies." A handful of Facebook employees have committed to fly less or stop flying altogether for the next 90 days to protest the Trump executive order, according to Business Insider. The protest was organized by Facebook vice president of engineering Regina Dugan, who posted about it on her Facebook page. 17744 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jUHffk NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.

The launch of Crosscheck has been timed to coincide with France's presidential elections. The first round of the election takes place April 23, followed by a run-off between the top two candidates on May 7 if no first-round candidate wins a majority. The project is run by First Draft News, which bills itself as a "nonprofit coalition," formed in June 2015 "to raise awareness and address challenges relating to trust and truth in the digital age." The project is being launched in France on February 27, where Crosscheck has made agreements with 16 French news outlets, including AFP, Le Monde and Buzzfeed News. These news websites have pledged to "ensure that accurate reports reach citizens across the country and beyond." Crosscheck is seen as a response to the recent election campaign in the US, where some news media expressed concerns that "fake news" distributed on Facebook persuaded the electorate to vote for Donald Trump over the overwhelming favorite for the Presidency, Hillary Clinton. Many news outlets in Europe and the US are keen to draw parallels between Donald Trump and National Front leader Marine Le Pen, since they share a Eurosceptic, anti-immigration platform. © AFP 2016/ ERIC PIERMONT Ex-French Economy Minister Macron Could Be 'US Agent' Lobbying Banks' InterestsDavy Rodriguez, deputy director of the Front national de la jeunesse (FNJ), the youth wing of the right-wing party, told Sputnik Francais that the media involved in the Crosscheck initiative are interested in promoting their own candidates, at the expense of the National Front. "We, in the National Front, are defending the idea of sovereignty. We are very concerned that giants like Google or Facebook are interested in these issues, and even more so that they are supported by media such as Libération, Rue89, Le Monde and La Voix du Nord. These are our political opponents, they openly oppose the National Front. This is media which supports a specific political camp," Rodriguez said. "The fact that major US corporations are relying on this type of media, to destabilize French politics, is very, very alarming. All the more so, because of fear after the UK voted in favor of 'Brexit' and Donald Trump won the election in the US. We don't think it's normal for large corporations, Facebook and Google, to act in such a way. In any case, they know who their opponent is. The participation of groups such as Libération shows that this was done in order to fight against the National Front." Rodriguez said that he opposes the interference of Google and Facebook in the French election, and cast doubt on the credentials of US companies to warn the French about "fake news." "The US is a country which specializes in fraud and misinformation. We have seen what kind of propaganda was promoted by them during the conflict in Syria, the conflict in Ukraine. We have seen how they carried out destruction and then said, 'this is false information, this is disinformation.' In any case, who can take it upon themselves to say what is true and what is false when they are two and a half thousand kilometers away from what is happening? This is a real problem." Gilbert Collard, French National Front deputy for the Gard constituency, told Sputnik Francais that Crosscheck is an "unacceptable" attack on free speech. "This 'police' is on a par with the media, which sometimes support this or that political camp. We clearly see here a desire to restrain the extraordinary freedom of expression that exists in social networks." © AFP 2016/ THOMAS COEX France's National Front Aims to Win Over Jewish Voters With Trip to Israel"This is an attempt to silence speech, to curtail the language of free speech. I find it absolutely outrageous. This is outrageous, not only because these online resources have assigned themselves the right to act in the role of the police, without having any qualifications to play this role, but they themselves can spread false information." "It seems to me that the media are afraid of losing power and have assigned themselves a kind of power of the Inquisition, which from a democratic point of view, no-one gave them. This is a roundabout way of putting pressure on public opinion and the electorate from above, with the help of the millionaires who own these media outlets, to support a particular candidate or particular opinion. This is largely about the desire to manipulate information and infringe on freedom of information,' Collard said. According to a recent opinion poll conducted February 6 by Ifop-Fiducial for Paris Match, iTélé and Sud-Radio, Le Pen is the leading candidate supported by 25.5 percent of voters.  In second place is former Economy Minister and En Marche! founder Emmanuel Macron on 20.5 percent. Center-right candidate Francois Fillon is supported by 18.5 percent, and Benoit Hamon of Francois Hollande's Socialists is fourth with 15.5 percent support. In spite of concerns over the impact of so-called "fake news" on the US election, a working paper from academics at the universities of Stanford and New York shows that social media played a much smaller role in the US election than some might think. “A reader of our study could very reasonably say, based on our set of facts, that it is unlikely that fake news swayed the election,” said Gentzkow, an economics professor and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), in a press release. ...

They (MSM) are the #1 "fake news" promoters and feel free to spread their disinformation, lies and propaganda, and it's been so for ages! Now, they even have the help and support (and censorship!) of FB and Google (the new rich kids on the bloc) . And some are still demanding more money, for financing more of the same crap! Thank God for alternative view points as on RT, Sputnik, plenty other alternative media outlets out there, that thrive with just a small percentage of all the money the MSM has! The reason these alternative media outlets are on the rise, while the MSM is collapsing, has nothing to do with money, it has to do with reporting facts, asking questions, helping people worldwide to reach their own conclusions about matters that concern us all.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Monday, January 30, 2017, 7:00 [IST] A couple of weeks back, Google rolled out an update to its location and navigation service - Google Maps. This update added the redesigned ride services section to the app. The ride services were already a part of Google Maps, but until this update, Google Maps would just offer the ride estimate for Ola and Uber cab hailing services and to complete the process of booking the ride, users had to use the respective apps. With the most recent Google Maps update, users can book either an Uber ride without opening the app of the cab hailing service. However, this is not the case with Ola. Users who want to book an Ola ride still have to open the Ola app to complete the booking process. The advantage of the integration of Uber service in Google Maps is that users need not even install the Uber app on their smartphone. It just requires users to sign in to the Uber account to book a ride directly from Google Maps.

Creators with fewer than 10,000 subscribers will eventually get the feature as well, but Google isn’t saying exactly when. “Immersive video has been a huge area of focus for YouTube,” said Kurt Wilms, a San Francisco-based product manager at Google’s YouTube, in an interview. “We believe that as video moves forward, we are changing from a one-way conversation to more of two-way conversation between the creator and the viewers. You’re seeing that with a lot of things YouTube is investing in, whether it is VR, some of the things we are doing on Community and, of course, live streaming.” Though live streaming has been on YouTube since 2011 in different forms, up until now it has been primarily for popular accounts using a computer or during special events that relayed a professional broadcast feed. For example, millions tuned in to watch the Royal wedding back in 2011, according to Google, while more than one-sixth of the Internet watched the Red Bell space jump live on YouTube. In a new statistic released by the company Tuesday, the number of creators live streaming daily on YouTube has increased four times year-over-year.  The difference with Tuesday’s announcement is that creators who meet the minimum subscriber threshold will now be able to hit a button in the iOS or Android app and quickly stream to viewers from their phone — a move that directly takes on Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc in the mobile live streaming space. “We’ve been working with hundreds of creators to test the product and we’ve done some pretty cool things to make it useful, incorporate their feedback and ultimately make it a very useful tool for our creators to engage with their fans,” said Wilms. These features include improving the quality of the stream even when signal strength is poor, quickly reacting to and filtering viewer comments, plus adding fun filters on the video itself, he said. Paying for attention Another live streaming feature YouTube is releasing on Tuesday is Super Chat, which will let viewers pay real money to have their comments in the chatroom literally rise above the rest — an option some may find useful if there are thousands of others watching the stream as well. “As chat is flying at a thousand messages per second, viewers can make purchases of these really fun and brightly coloured digital chat messages that really help them stand out from others in the crowd,” said Barbara Macdonald, a YouTube product manager in San Francisco. “Depending on how much money a fan chooses to pay, the message will get more air time.” Super Chat prices start $1 and go up to a maximum of $500. The more money someone pays, the more letters they can use in a colourful message and the longer it will stay pinned to the top of the chatroom. For example, someone paying between $2.50 and $4.99 will get just 50 characters and a light blue bubble, but it won’t stay pinned top the top of the chat. Meanwhile, someone who drops $25 will get an orange 225-character message that will be pinned for 10 minutes, $100 gets a red 270-character message pinned for an hour, while the maximum $500 gets a 350-character message that sticks around for five hours. Skeptics who think people will never pay for a better chance to be seen by popular YouTube creators are wrong, according to Google. Vancouver-based Typical Gamer, who has more than 4.4 million subscribers, made a quick $4,000 in an hour and a half through Super Chat messages while live streaming himself playing the video game Grand Theft Auto 5. Another creator made $900 simply walking around a Target department store in the U.S. as viewers suggested things to do or buy. Related Google Canada and Canada Media Fund to make YouTube channel promoting homegrown content Canadians first to get new YouTube mobile feature that will make sharing videos more social “It lets creators be able to really easily identify who their top fans are, because they are the ones who are sending Super Chats,” said Macdonald. “But one of the best parts about Super Chats is that it is a brand new revenue stream for our creators. It is a non-ad, entirely new monetization feature while they are live streaming.” Google compares the idea of Super Chat to people who pay more money to sit closer to their favourite bands at concerts or attend backstage VIP events before the show. The company said it doesn’t think the feature creates a two-tiered fan system because everyone still has access to the video content and regular chatroom. “All viewers are able to participate, it’s just that some of them can opt to have more air time for their messages and to try to get more recognition,” said Macdonald.

Make them obsolete. In the latest beta update to Chrome, Google said it will be integrating progressive web apps into the Android operating system in a more deeper way, down to the system level. So much so that they will almost be indistinguishable from the native apps stored on your phone. If you have ever used Flipkart’s mobile website or even Freecharge’s for that matter, you are already familiar with progressive web apps or PWAs. They load instantly, even when there’s little to no network, respond seamlessly to your flicks and swishes and feel just like using a native app. In essence, these are very much like mobile apps but doesn’t come with the baggage of taking up precious storage on your phone. “In the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out a new version of this experience in Chrome beta. With this new version, once a user adds a Progressive Web App to their Home screen, Chrome will integrate it into Android in a much deeper way than before,” said the Chromium blog. The web app could previously be pinned on the home screen through Chrome shortcuts, but now these PWAs will be more integrated deep enough for them to appear on the app drawer as well as on the Settings app and allow them to interact with other apps installed in the system. A long press on them will surface notifications. A move like this could potentially disrupt the mobile apps-space. If you have the option of getting the same experience of a native app from a mobile website, why take the pains of downloading it? In fact, with app downloads slowing down globally, PWAs could be the final nail in the coffin. Opera’s VP for South and South East Asia, Sunil Kamath pointed out to Gizmodo India that such a move could be beneficial especially in a market like India. “PWA could be an interesting trade-off for a market like India and 2017 could be a year it takes off. The dynamics are quite suitable for this market. If you go beyond tier 1 cities, the inertia to download an app over a data network is still an issue and the network itself is a bit questionable in India,” said Kamath in a conversation which happened a couple of weeks before Google announced the integration of PWAs in the Android app drawer. Both Google and Microsoft have been hard at work trying to scale down the web to work more like an app. Apps have the advantage of minimal load times while pulling info from the web and displaying it on attractive splash screens. PWAs also do essentially the same, minus the need to install them on your local storage. With Progressive Web Apps and Hosted Web Apps, both Google and Microsoft have been pushing for this paradigm for quite a while. Flipkart already uses Google’s platform for its Flipkart Lite web app with an enhanced mobile experience that completely does away with the need to install the native app. "We know that everyone needs to build mobile-first experiences. With Flipkart Lite, we've developed a powerful, technically-advanced web app that performs as well as our native app. We now feel we have the best of both worlds,” said Amar Nagaram, an Engineering Director at Flipkart at the time told Gizmodo India. Opera too have been at the thick of web apps for quite some time. Former CEO and co-founder Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner said, “ the idea behind progressive web apps has been around for many years and this is yet another effort to push it forward. We believe in this direction and hope to see even wider adoption.” Opera launched the Opera Platform way back in 2003 for exactly this reason. It was a web-based UI for phones. To leverage elements like web widgets, web OSes, smart TVs, etc. “This was all way ahead of its time and it is surprising that it has taken so long for Google to implement it. So for me, the time where Web applications were at the level of native applications was 14 years ago,” he claimed. The slow uptake in the adoption of web-apps may be attributed to higher development costs as compared to a standard mobile website. Tetzchner’s new company, Vivaldi which is coming out with a new browser that is due to hit smartphones sometime this year may also not come with support for PWAs from the beginning, pointing towards the incremental resources needed to enable support for PWAs. Mozilla’s Firefox OS which was largely a cloud-based OS leveraging web apps wasn’t quite successful for this very reason. However, considering the might of Google and Microsoft, along with innovators like Opera pushing hard for the adoption of PWAs, 2017 might just be the year web-apps finally breach the mainstream and become the status quo.

This could have a big impact on other retailers using PLAs to market their wares to consumers. In the last two weeks of 2016, performance marketing agency Merkle noticed that PLAs for Amazon began appearing and seemed to focus on the home goods category, where it ramped up quickly: Where Amazon does show, its impression share for PLAs generally started in the mid-teens and remained there through December 23rd. Amazon’s share then jumped over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (the most recent day that is populated in the Auction Insights report) and is now already high enough to make Amazon a top five competitor for some programs. While Amazon's intentions are not clear – it could simply be running a test – Amazon's use of PLAs seems to have grown in January. According to Internet Retailer, Merkle "found that Amazon only appeared in four of the reports in late December, but by mid-January, Amazon appeared in more than 20 reports," suggesting that if this is a test, Amazon is expanding it. An increasingly important part of Google's business, and perhaps Amazon's too Google PLAs were launched in 2012, but while Amazon has continued to buy AdWords ads, it has not been a buyer of PLAs. According to Merkle's senior director of research, Mark Ballard, "The conventional wisdom around why Amazon had refused to participate in Google Shopping has been that doing so would strengthen Google’s position in the battle to be consumers’ first destination for product searches by making Google’s results more complete. "That and Amazon would have to cut a (bigger) check to Google every month for traffic that Amazon may have eventually captured anyway." Amazon's refusal to buy PLAs hasn't hurt Google. PLA spending rose 30% in Q4 2016, and clicks grew by 43%. For retailers, PLA clicks now account for almost half of their total Google ad clicks. Interestingly, Amazon's absence from the market might have been a good thing for retailers. After all, PLAs give them the ability to target and sell directly to consumers and not having to compete with Amazon and its big dollars has probably made the market less costly than it would had Amazon been bidding up PLAs. But Ballard hypothesizes that Amazon no longer has the luxury of sitting on the sidelines... As more and more searches shift to mobile though, [Amazon's] stance may be less tenable and profitable for Amazon, as Google’s status as the default search provider on the two major mobile platforms has meant that Google’s already commanding lead in the search business has only grown in recent years. With less competing real estate on phone results, PLAs also generate a higher share of ad clicks on mobile than desktop. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that Amazon appears to be more aggressively bidding for PLAs on mobile devices. As Internet Retailer notes, "its impression share of phone PLAs is about twice as high as it is for desktop PLAs." Bad news for retailers? If Amazon commits to buying PLAs and scales up its efforts significantly, it could be unwelcome news for retailers not named Amazon. A greater Amazon presence in the market would almost certainly make it more difficult for retailers to maintain their current share of impressions, and depending on how aggressive Amazon gets, it's possible that some retailers would have to spend more just to maintain their current level, or even a lower level, of impressions. Needless to say, retailers advertising through Google Shopping will want to closely watch Amazon's efforts.

Before you either fix your device yourself or give it to a technician to help you fix it, it is important you try to identify what the problem is or might be, and what the problem isn’t. With this knowledge, the problem will be easier for you to solve on your own or, if you decide to give the phone to a technician instead, it will help you avoid being cheated. A diagnostic app can help you pinpoint the problem causing your device to run slowly. Phone Doctor Plus and Z-device Test are good diagnostic apps to consider. You can find them on Google Play Store. Some Android devices come with diagnostic apps, like Samsung with the Samsung Smart Care app. In this case, you can take advantage of that rather than downloading another from the Google Play Store. CLEAR YOUR CACHED DATA This is more or less a temporary solution if your device’s slowness is caused by the unnecessary or ‘rarely used’ apps you installed. Cache data eats up system resources (takes up storage space on your device) while slowing down your device. You should clear this data from time to time or install a cache clearing app, like Clean Master, from the Google Play Store. You have nothing to fear deleting this data, anything important will simply be re-cached the next time you open the app. This is considered a temporary solution because you’ll eventually have to delete some of these apps you are clearing the cached data of, to more permanently fix the problem of your device running slowly. UNINSTALL AND DISABLE UNNECESSARY APPS If after diagnosing the problem, you find that a certain app or the multiple apps you installed on your device is causing your device to run slowly, you should immediately uninstall it. For apps that you cannot delete (those that come preloaded on your phone and are otherwise called ‘bloatware’), you should disable as many as you are not using to keep them from running in the background, choking your device’s storage and interfering with its speed and efficiency. You can uninstall or disable apps through the app manager found in your device’s settings, and keep these apps from becoming the ‘resource hogs’ that slow down your Android device. NOTE – You should also learn to close all apps you are no longer using. Don’t just open it and change to another app without closing the one you previously opened. This helps to free up your RAM and improve your device’s performance. FREE UP YOUR DEVICE STORAGE Aside uninstalling unnecessary apps, especially if the problem is caused by insufficient storage, you should also delete some of the many files (music, videos, documents etc.) that are filling up your internal storage. Make the sacrifice; delete those files you don’t actually need but keep for sentimental reasons. If you want to avoid, losing certain files completely, you can transfer them to another device (another phone, a laptop, or a tablet) or a flash drive or hard drive. NOTE – You can also consider disabling some of the widgets running on your device that you are not really using, alongside animations and live wallpapers you have running on your phone. Widgets, animations and live wallpapers may be fanciful, but they affect your device’s performance and battery live. PERFORM A FACTORY DATA RESET Over time, a lot goes on in your device’s software so it’s always advisable to give your device a fresh start from time to time. Know that this should not be done often, only from time to time especially when all the other tips don’t work as well as you want them to do. A factory data reset will wipe your device clean and leave the software the way it was when you first turned on the device; so be sure to backup important files before you do this. Some Android devices come with a “Backup and Reset” option in the device’s settings, so you can take advantage of that. Some other devices have a recovery menu for backing up important files. The steps are different for every device, so you can use Google to help you out with the steps for your device.

Google Brain Creates Technology That Can Zoom In and Enhance Pixelated Images GO This is pretty much the dream technology for cop shows Feb 7, 2017 14:42 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Google Brain has now created a new software that will make the dreams of every CSI fan who’s annoyed the main technology used throughout the series doesn’t exist come true. Well, it didn't exist, as it does now because the new Google software can create detailed images from tiny, pixelated images. Zoom and enhance has been the target of so many jokes over the years because everyone with a computer knows that it’s impossible to get a clear picture when zooming in on an average picture. You’d just get loads of larger pixels and not a clear image. Or better said, used to. This new pixel recursive super resolution technology has really cool-looking results, extracting loads of details from a few source pixels. For instance, Google Brain presented some 8x8 pixel images which it then turned into some pretty clear photos where you can actually tell facial features apart. What is this sorcery, you ask? Well, it’s Google combining two neural networks. The first one, the conditioning network, works to map the 8x8 pixel source image against other high-resolution images. Basically, it downsizes other high-res images to the same 8x8 size and tries to make a match on the features. Then, the second network comes into play, called the prior network. This one uses an implementation of PixelCNN to add realistic, high-res details to that 8x8 source image. If the networks know that one particular pixel could be an eye, when you zoom in, you’ll see the shape of an eye there. Or an eyebrow, or a mouth, for instance. The zooming progression Easily fooled The technology was put to the test and it was quite successful against humans. Human observers were shown a high-resolution celebrity face vs. the upscaled image resulted from Google Brain. Ten percent of the time, they were fooled. When it comes to the bedroom images used by Google for the testing, 28 percent of humans were fooled by the computed image. It should be kept in mind, however, that while the idea is nice, the resulting images are pretty much guess work. They’re not real because you really can’t just make an image appear out of nothing. You can, however, use an educated guess and get something that might be close to accurate. An image of a suspect in a break-in, for instance, would get more details, but you won’t be able to say “hey, I know that guy” with complete certainty.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 February 2017 by Military News New Survey Reveals Most MSPs Feel Greatest Competition from Google, Other Cloud Vendors WALTHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Sonian, the leading provider of cloud-based email archiving and insights, today unveiled new survey findings that reveal that 79 percent of managed service providers (MSPs) today feel their greatest competitive threat is cloud providers, as opposed to other MSPs. This represents a significant leap from five years ago, when only 54 percent of MSPs viewed cloud providers as their greatest competition. MSPs of all sizes agreed they lost more deals to Google than any other cloud provider, including Amazon, Hewlett Packard, IBM and Microsoft – and expect Google to be the cloud market leader by 2021. These findings were detailed in a new report released today, “A New World Order: How MSPs are Trying to Survive and Thrive in a Cloud-first World,” based on a Berg Research survey of more than 300 MSPs commissioned by Sonian. The MSP Market in an Increasingly Cloud-First World Not even ten years ago, MSPs served as critical, trusted IT advisors to companies of all sizes, offering unmatched insight into organizations’ data center environments, service portfolios, applications requirements and service and compliance levels, along with the technology to act on these insights. In the past few years, however, MSPs’ position has been threatened by cloud providers, who increasingly sell directly to end users. With cloud vendors now routinely bypassing the channel, MSPs are forced to innovate in order to maintain market share. The MSP Challenge The survey validated that mounting competition from cloud vendors is real, showing that: Small businesses (organizations with 100 – 500 employees) have most drastically changed their perception of cloud providers, with 82 percent saying cloud vendors are their greatest competition today versus just 50 percent in 2011. Though MSPs cited Microsoft as their second largest competitor today, the majority of respondents said that they expect Amazon to become a more formidable force than Microsoft in the next five years. Competition from cloud vendors has forced 50 percent of surveyed MSPs to moderately reduce their costs to acquire new customers, and 18 percent to substantially reduce their costs to acquire new customers. The MSP Opportunity: Security and Analytics To reclaim market value, 55 percent of MSPs believe introducing new services is critical: 67 percent of respondents plan to launch or expand security offerings 65 percent plan to launch or expand pure cloud hosting services 58 percent plan to launch or expand storage offerings Moreover, 51 percent expect that data analytics and business intelligence will increasingly play a key role in delivering value, with 45 percent of respondents noting that business intelligence has served as a large business driver in the past 12 months. „Expanding their service offerings will be critical for MSPs in today’s market to remain competitive,” said Jeff Lippincott, vice president of business development at Sonian. „The new survey findings confirm what we already have seen play out in the industry: that cloud vendors are having a real impact on MSPs’ bottom lines by interfacing directly with end users. To not only cope with this threat but thrive in the market, MSPs must take advantage of the opportunity to invest in new services such as secure data storage, business intelligence applications and hosted email applications. By doing so, they will be able to offer services their customers regard as indispensable.” Tim McKinnon, CEO of Sonian, added: „Sonian’s business model is built off our relationship with MSP partners. As the market evolves and presents greater opportunity for them to offer data storage and business intelligence, our core offerings, we anticipate that our partnerships will only become stronger and stronger.” Research Methodology As commissioned by Sonian, Berg Research surveyed 327 respondents from MSP organizations that sell services to businesses, and some to both consumers and businesses. Respondents came from companies ranging from 100 – 1,000 employees and hold customer-facing roles in various departments, including sales, account management, marketing and business development.

Home > Google News > Misc Google > Google Search Console Alerts For Recommended Wordpress & Joomla Updates Available Google Search Console Alerts For Recommended Wordpress & Joomla Updates Available Feb 7, 2017 • 7:38 am | (13) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Other Google Topics Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Yesterday, Google Search Console sent batches of alerts and notifications to webmasters operating popular CMS (content management systems) such as Wordpress and Joomla to update their version of their CMS if they were out of date. Most people are talking about the Wordpress notification, but it went to many flavors of CMSs including Wordpress, Joomla and others. The email alert reads for Wordpress: Google has detected that your site is currently running Wordpress 4.7.0 or 4.7.1, an older version of Wordpress. Outdated or unpatched software can be vulnerable to hacking and malware exploits that harm potential visitors to your site. Therefore, we suggest you update the software on your site as soon as possible. The email alert reads for Joomla: Google has detected that your site is currently running Joomla 1.5, an older version of Joomla. Outdated or unpatched software can be vulnerable to hacking and malware exploits that harm potential visitors to your site. Therefore, we suggest you update the software on your site as soon as possible. Obviously the version numbers can change depending on which version you are running. The Google Webmaster Help forums and WebmasterWorld forums are on fire with tons of posts about these notices. What should you do? Upgrade. Forum discussion at Google Webmaster Help and WebmasterWorld. Update: Some are claiming that the alerts to some webmasters are wrong and that their Wordpress sites are updated. It might just be a timing and delay issue.

Google explained that AMP pages, which we have on this site, use three different URLs: Original URL: The publisher’s document written in the AMP format http://www.example.com/amp/doc.html
 AMP Cache URL: The document served through an AMP Cache (e.g., all AMPs served by Google are served through the Google AMP Cache). Most users will never see this URL. https://www-example-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/www.example.com/amp/doc.html Google AMP Viewer URL: The document displayed in an AMP viewer (e.g., when rendered on the search result page). https://www.google.com/amp/www.example.com/amp.doc.html Here is the breakdown visually of how Google now adds a little link icon to share the original URL or canonical URL: Here is a GIF of it in action on this site: So now, it is a bit easier to share the right URL - but I wonder how many will actually do that versus use the built in URL share feature? Google did add that "in the coming weeks, the Android Google app will share the original URL of a document when users tap on the app’s share button. This functionality is already available on the iOS Google app." Forum discussion at Google+, Twitter and Google Webmaster Help.

But which are used for URL discovery to be used in web search? Well, John Mueller of Google said Google AdsBot is not one of them that is used for URL discovery. He said so on Twitter when Dawn Anderson asked him, he responded, "as far as I know that's not the case." Here are the tweets: @dawnieando as far as I know that's not the case.— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) February 6, 2017 If I had to guess, these bots are used for search URL discover; Googlebot, Googlebot-News, Googlebot-Image, and Googlebot-Video. These bots are not used for search URL discovery; Mediapartners-Google, Mediapartners, AdsBot-Google and AdsBot-Google-Mobile-Apps. In short, Google tries hard to separate ads with organic even when it comes to crawling and URL discovery. Forum discussion at Twitter.

By Owen Hughes February 7, 2017 14:26 GMT The LG Watch Style (pictured) is set to launch alongside the LG Watch Sport on 8 FebruaryTwitter/ Evan Blass Two new flagship Google smartwatches will launch on 8 February bringing Android Wear 2.0 to gadget-lovers' wrists. LG has been lined up as the manufacturer of the wearable and owing to its strong track record in Android-powered devices, our hopes are high. Thanks to a steady stream of leaks over the past few weeks we already know that the new smartwatches will be called the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style. We've also got a fairly good idea of how the watches will look and operate, not least thanks to a set of user manuals erroneously published online by LG itself. The manuals mostly serve to back up what we already knew – or had least speculated – about the flagship Android Wear 2.0 wearables, which have previously been likened as the smartwatch equivalent of Google's Nexus program. For example, they confirm that both devices will feature Google Assistant – the voice controlled AI that launched on the Google Pixel in 2016 – and that fitness tracking elements will be fairly prominent. Users will be able to boot up Google's digital assistant by saying "OK Google", or pressing and holding the power button, and issuing a command. Google Assistant will be able to set reminders, take notes or even show users their step count and heart rate, which will be measured through the pre-installed Google Fit app. The LG Watch Sport is the larger of the two devices and works without a smartphoneLG The LG Watch Sport is the clear bellwether of the two devices, owing to the fact it features a SIM card slot that will allow it to place calls without the need for a paired smartphone. It comes with a SIM card pre-installed, which can be replaced opening the back of the device using a specially-designed key. The Sport is also the first Android Wear device to use an NFC chip to make contactless payments with it using Android Pay. The manual shows how this will work smartwatch similarly to how it does on Android smartphones, by booting up the app and simply tapping the watch face against an NFC payment terminal. The LG Watch Sport will be capable of contactless payments using Android PayLG Android Pay also has its own physical shortcut button on the bottom right of the watch. This sits beneath the crown/ dial, which operates as the device's power button and navigation button. The LG G Style, on the other hand, appears to be a more fashion-focused timepiece. Because of this, users will be able to pop out and change watch bands easily thanks to a "snap-and-swap" system. The charging systems also differs: whereas the Watch Sport will charge wirelessly on a cradle similar to the Moto 360, the Watch Style will come with a magnetic charging pad. LG has now removed the smartwatch manuals from its website, however you can still access them here via Android Central.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 February 2017 by Military News Neurosurgeon Creates Inirv React, a Life-saving Smart Home Device That can Turn Stoves off When Left on We have worked hard with our engineering team to make this next stretch goal a possibility and will continue to see what other integrations are attainable so everyone can take advantage of these advanced features. Durham, NC (PRWEB) February 07, 2017 Inirv React is the first smart knob and sensor combination that has the potential to save lives. Inirv React is currently running a campaign on Kickstarter and will be live for the next 9 days. The campaign is 325% funded and has introduced various stretch goals that will improve the functionality and convenience of the device. The first stretch goal, Amazon Echo integration, was unlocked when the campaign hit $85,000. The second stretch goal, which was for dynamic position-sensitive LEDs, was unlocked when the campaign hit the milestone of $125,000. Most recently, the campaign has announced a third stretch goal which is for the addition of Google Home integration and will unlock when the campaign hits $175,000. With Google Home integration, users can turn their stove off as well as check if the stove is on through simple voice commands from anywhere in their home. “We want to add Google Home to our list of integration because this will open up the voice command features to more of our backers,” said Inirv React co-founder Ranjith Babu, who is also a Neurosurgeon at Duke University. “We have worked hard with our engineering team to make this next stretch goal a possibility and will continue to see what other integrations are attainable so everyone can take advantage of these advanced features.” Inirv React comes with a set of four smart knobs and a sensor unit that attaches to the ceiling above the stove. This sensor houses the gas, smoke, and motion detectors which are able to pick up hazards before they escalate. If an unsafe condition is detected or there is no motion in the kitchen for a prolonged period of time, the sensor unit signals the knob units via Bluetooth to turn off the burners. Additionally, using the Inirv React app, users not only receive real-time alerts regarding their kitchen environment, but can also turn their stove off remotely if they have already left their home. With the remaining days, Inirv React plans to reach the $175,000 stretch goal and hopefully add a another smart home integration stretch goal. Inirv React can be purchased at the discounted price of $229, which is $60 off the future retail price of $299. To learn more, or to pre-order, please visit bit.ly/InirvReactKS.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation Donald Trump Needs to Totally Dump Google Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Donald Trump Needs to Totally Dump Google Posted at 9:14 am on February 7, 2017 by Seton Motley Share on Facebook Share on Twitter It is certainly understandable that the Donald Trump presidency has left Google – oops, I mean Alphabet – more than a mite discombobulated. Google has just spent the last eight years all-but-running the Barack Obama Administration.  Google people visited the Obama White House at least 427 times.  Dozens of key Google staffers – transmogrified into key Obama Administration staffers.  Google literally wrote ridiculously crony policies that ridiculously favored them and crippled their competitors. But all bad things must come to an end.  The eight-year-long-national-nightmare Obama Administration finally drew to a close.  And as it did, Google went all-in to secure Obama’s Democrat successor – Hillary Clinton.  To ensure that its crony gravy train continued. Lest we forget, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt in June 2016 claimed “We’re not going to touch Trump vs. Clinton.”  Which was..not exactly true.  Schmidt worked directly with the Clinton campaign.  Schmidt was also a member of the “Democratic Victory Task Force.”  Google was caught – at least twice – rigging Clinton search results so as to cover up her massive corruption. But none of it worked.  The Google crony magic was gone – Trump won. Trending Trump Acts As Apologist For 'Killer' Putin During Interview With Bill O'Reilly (VIDEO) | RedState Jay Caruso And Google hasn’t been dealing particularly well: Anti-Trump Protesters Gather at Google Headquarters: “(C)rowd(s) at the Mountain View, California headquarters, as well as offices in San Francisco, New York, Seattle, and around the world,…A person at the (headquarters) rally told CNBC that Google CEO Sundar Pichai and cofounder Sergey Brin spoke there.…” Not dealing so well: “‘Some of us may need to adopt Pence 2017 bumper stickers,’ Google’s cofounder Sergey Brin joked at a company sponsored anti-Trump protest….” Not dealing very well at all: “Google lawyers flooded the California office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, demanding she oppose (Trump nominee) Sen. Jeff Sessions’ confirmation as attorney general.” Eric Schmidt’s opposition has also been…less than understated: “(T)he Trump administration is ‘going to do these evil things.…’” But while doing and saying things like all of that – Schmidt and Google are attempting to do things like this: “Eric Schmidt, Google’s former CEO and chair of Alphabet, has traveled to Trump Tower a least twice to meet with the president and his team, but hasn’t made any real progress.” Google should make absolutely zero progress.  They spent most of the last decade enjoying anti-free market government favors from a Democrat administration.  They strived mightily to ensure that there would be a successor Democrat administration – to continue their crippling cronyism. And Google lost.  To Trump – a man who won in large part by pledging to end just this sort of Washington, D.C. business-as-usual corruption. Google’s minions should be totally removed from anywhere they infest the federal government – and Google should get absolutely no further favoritism from DC. Much has rightly been made of Obama Administration staff holdovers being obnoxious, surreptitious disruptors of the Trump Administration.  They all should be in totality swept out of the government.  Yet bizarrely: Trump Keeping 50 Obama Administration Officials.  Why on Earth would he do that? As but one example – Trump is inheriting Patent and Trademark Office head Michelle Lee.  Whose immediately preceding gig was the first ever head of Patents and Patent Strategy – for Google.  Google’s patent strategy – is to steal as many patents as they possibly can.  I would like to think the Trump Administration would remove Google’s crafter of patent theft – from atop the U.S. patent office. Despite some lame face-saving attempts at post-election outreach, Google clearly remains vociferously opposed to the Trump Administration and the many anti-cronyism cleanups in which this administration is going to engage. Obama Administration Google holdovers – are an awful subset of all of the awful Obama Administration holdovers.  Leaving any of these residual moles in place – will only greatly hamstring and damage the DC improvements this administration will try to make.  ALL of them – absolutely need to go. And any continued Google lobbying efforts – any attempts to maintain any of their government-crony favors – should be summarily rebuffed and dismissed.  While their government-favors – are summarily rolled back and dispatched. Google has already had all things DC their way – for far too long.

Though Apple’s biggest rival already had an intelligent personal assistant, called S Voice, for a number of premium devices it launched in the past, the company decided to develop a more advanced voice assistant that would be a direct competitor to Apple’s Siri and Google’s Google Assistant. The move isn’t surprising at all, for Samsung bought AI and assistant system firm Viv late last year.  Viv is a company by people responsible for the creation and success of Apple’s Siri. Hence, many reports are putting emphasis on the idea that Bixby will be a strong rival against Apple’s famous voice assistant. Interestingly, it was found out recently that the new AI will be nowhere near the prowess of the established assistant in terms of the languages they support. According to ETNews, Samsung’s assistant will support seven to eight languages at launch. The range does not come close to the 20 supported languages of Siri.  Even though Bixby is no match to Siri in the language department, it is till going to impress several markets at launch because it supports more languages than Google’s Google Assistant, which was introduced along with the Pixel handsets. Google Assistant only supports five languages, namely: English, German, Brazilian, Portuguese and Hindi. As for Bixby, it is reportedly supporting all five languages plus Korean and Chinese the moment it is introduced at Samsung's big event, as per Phone Arena.  Related Stories Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumored To Source Batteries From Japanese Firm Edge-To-Edge Smartphone Displays — Explained Recent Samsung Galaxy S8 Leaks And Renders Rundown Bixby will have an integral role in the success of the Galaxy S8 on the market. The new AI assistant is seen as one of the selling points of the device, alongside the major redesign and new features that Samsung is stuffing into the phone. Making the most out of its virtual assistant, Samsung intends to incorporate the voice-activated feature to the S8 interface, individual apps and the Internet of Things to make it ubiquitous.  Meanwhile, Forbes pointed out the big differences consumers should expect from the Galaxy S8 when compared with its predecessor. The first and perhaps the most conspicuous difference is found on the design of the device. Independent leaks have since claimed that Samsung Galaxy S8 will sport an edge-to-edge display. The next difference lies on the processing power of the handsets. The new phone will house Qualcomm's most powerful processor to date, the Snapdragon 835. Finally, the larger battery is without a doubt another aspect that distinguishes the S8 from the S7. Are you excited for Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and its Bixby voice assistant?

Get rid of the humans and use this software, says start-up! While SEO consultants are busy updating their techniques, a YC-backed startup, RankScience, has come up with a ground-breaking software with potential to put SEO consultants out of business Sami Khan   February 7, 2017 19:20 IST Google LogoReuters Ask anyone who is running a website and they will tell you SEO isn't child's play. Mastering the art of search engine optimisation (SEO) is a challenge in itself. Ipso facto, we conveniently delegate the task to a team of dedicated consultants to identify the areas in order to improve your website ranking. Google ranks websites using a shape-shifting algorithm. Keeping up with Google's algorithm is out of question, to say the least.  While SEO consultants are busy updating their techniques, a YC-backed startup, RankScience, has come up with a ground-breaking software with potential to put SEO consultants out of business, TechCrunch reported. RankScience has engineered a fully automated software that run thousands of A/B tests on a website to identify the necessary changes to be made in order to improve the SEO ranking by leaps and bounds. The startup claims that the software can boost the average organic search traffic for a website by 37 percent in three months. "Our software identifies areas of opportunity and things that companies should be testing based on where they're ranking now, what they're competitors are doing, and what opportunities we see. And also this data that we have from across our network — things that we see that are working elsewhere on similar sites," Bedner said. Ryan Bedner, the mastermind behind RankScience, is a programmer who also has worked as an SEO consultant. His expertise in both domains set the foundation for the new software. While there are plenty of SEO software products in the market, nothing compares to RankScience. Most of the SEO softwares only track the trends and heavily rely on human intervention for implementing changes. RockScience uses a CDN (content delivery network) to make the recommended changes. According to RockScience, it only takes "two minutes" for the "one-line code change," to set up the software. And the auto-pilot takes over. However, Bedner says some human inputs are required at the moment. In case you are wondering if automating SEO will land you in trouble with Google, fret not. Bedner assures that the methods are completely "white hat" and compliant with Google's best practices. As its customer base increases, which is currently limited to a couple of dozen, RockScience will have a better understanding of what works on other sites across the network.

Airbnb is following up its Super Bowl ad calling for acceptance with a campaign to provide short-term housing over the next five years for 100,000 people in need. An announcement on the rental service's website says it plans to start with refugees, disaster survivors and relief workers, but wants 'to accommodate many more types of displaced people over time.' SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Through a Super Bowl ad, public statements and court filings, Silicon Valley's biggest companies are taking a strong stand against President Donald Trump's travel ban, saying high tech needs immigrants' creativity and energy to stay competitive. Although the companies are risking a backlash from customers who side with Trump, they say the pushback is necessary for an industry dependent on thousands of highly skilled foreign workers. About 58 percent of the engineers and other high-skill employees in Silicon Valley were born outside the U.S., according to the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, an industry trade group. "Immigration and innovation go hand in hand," said Carl Guardino, the group's CEO. "This cuts so deeply into the bone and marrow of what fuels the innovation economy that very few CEOs feel the luxury of sitting on the sidelines. So people are going to stand up and speak up." The tech industry contends there aren't enough Americans with the specialized skills these companies need. The ban, tech companies say, would make hiring even tougher and pressure them to move some operations abroad. "A lot of these companies will really struggle if all of a sudden we turn off the spigot," said Greg Morrisett, dean of Cornell University's Computing and Information Science school. In a court filing Sunday against the ban, 97 companies, including such major tech players as Google, Apple, Microsoft, eBay, Netflix, Facebook and Twitter, also spoke of the entrepreneurial spirit of "people who choose to leave everything that is familiar and journey to an unknown land to make a new life." Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella both came from India. Google co-founder Sergey Brin is a Russian refugee who moved to the U.S. as a boy. The father of Apple's late co-founder, Steve Jobs, immigrated from Syria. The Silicon Valley Leadership Group estimates that half the companies in the region were co-founded by an immigrant or are now led by a CEO from outside the U.S. In signing an executive order Jan. 27 that would temporarily ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries, Trump said he was trying to protect Americans by preventing terrorists from slipping into the country. The administration says the president has the constitutional authority to decide who can enter. During the Super Bowl, several companies ran ads that promoted diversity and inclusion, as marketers tried to reach both sides of a consumer base roiled by the election. One of the most overtly political was from Airbnb, a company that matches travelers with places to stay. The San Francisco company showed close-ups of people with different ethnicities. A narrator says: "We believe no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept." Airbnb followed up with a campaign to provide short-term housing over the next five years for 100,000 people in need, starting with refugees, disaster survivors and relief workers. The company also said it will donate $4 million over four years to the International Rescue Committee, joining many tech brethren in making financial contributions. Google set up a $4 million "crisis fund" in January to support organizations that are helping immigrants and refugees, while ride-hailing service Lyft pledged $1 million over the next four years to the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups challenging the ban. And workers from Google and Comcast workers have staged walkouts over the restriction. "I wouldn't be where I am today or have any kind of life that I have today if this was not a brave country that really stood out and spoke for liberty," Brin told a crowd of Google employees who walked out in protest last week. Tech companies risk alienating the many Americans who support Trump and his policies. But the risk is lower than that of, say, a company that makes consumer products with plenty of alternatives. It's much harder to boycott a Facebook or Google, where you have friends or your email address, said digital marketing analyst Rebecca Lieb. She added that people are less likely to toss out a $2,000 laptop or pricey mobile phone than change soft drinks. In fact, tech companies might be more wary of backlash from the anti-Trump side. Last week, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit Trump's council of business leaders after an outcry from Uber customers and employees who were upset about the ban. In addition, most tech companies have operations around the world and risk alienating customers abroad if they stay silent. "We interact with a large global ecosystem and our businesses would not be here or be able to thrive without it," said Aaron Levie, CEO of Box Inc., an online storage service. "So our businesses are extremely sensitive, by default, to things that affect immigration and things that affect our relationship with the broader world."

Inirv React is currently running a campaign on Kickstarter and will be live for the next 9 days. The campaign is 325% funded and has introduced various stretch goals that will improve the functionality and convenience of the device. The first stretch goal, Amazon Echo integration, was unlocked when the campaign hit $85,000. The second stretch goal, which was for dynamic position-sensitive LEDs, was unlocked when the campaign hit the milestone of $125,000. Most recently, the campaign has announced a third stretch goal which is for the addition of Google Home integration and will unlock when the campaign hits $175,000. With Google Home integration, users can turn their stove off as well as check if the stove is on through simple voice commands from anywhere in their home. “We want to add Google Home to our list of integration because this will open up the voice command features to more of our backers,” said Inirv React co-founder Ranjith Babu, who is also a Neurosurgeon at Duke University. “We have worked hard with our engineering team to make this next stretch goal a possibility and will continue to see what other integrations are attainable so everyone can take advantage of these advanced features.” Inirv React comes with a set of four smart knobs and a sensor unit that attaches to the ceiling above the stove. This sensor houses the gas, smoke, and motion detectors which are able to pick up hazards before they escalate. If an unsafe condition is detected or there is no motion in the kitchen for a prolonged period of time, the sensor unit signals the knob units via Bluetooth to turn off the burners. Additionally, using the Inirv React app, users not only receive real-time alerts regarding their kitchen environment, but can also turn their stove off remotely if they have already left their home. With the remaining days, Inirv React plans to reach the $175,000 stretch goal and hopefully add a another smart home integration stretch goal. Inirv React can be purchased at the discounted price of $229, which is $60 off the future retail price of $299. To learn more, or to pre-order, please visit bit.ly/InirvReactKS.

The search giant said that pages with intrusive interstitials may not rank as highly in search results because these pop-ups do not make content easily accessible to users. January 10th has come and gone, with Google staying true to its word and implementing this newest ranking signal: “January 10, 2017 update: Starting today, pages where content is not easily accessible to a user on the transition from the mobile search results may not rank as high. As we said, this new signal is just one of hundreds of signals that are used in ranking and the intent of the search query is still a very strong signal, so a page may still rank highly if it has great, relevant content.” Has your site been affected since Google’s roll out of its mobile interstitials penalty? We’ve got insights in our latest #SEJSurveySays poll results. According to a survey sent out to Search Engine Journal’s Twitter audience, 51% say they have not felt the effects of Google’s mobile interstitials penalty, while 43% don’t know yet, and 6% say they have. It seems that the extent of this latest penalty hasn’t been widespread, with a large percentage still unsure or not feeling the effects based on our survey. This may be due to Google needing to do a fresh crawl of the web before a considerable impact is seen: @Marie_Haynes @JohnMu we need to recrawl the web afaik. That takes time — Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) January 17, 2017 If you have been affected and you’ve taken action to remove the intrusive pop-ups on your page, you may need to wait until Google recrawls your page to remove the demotion in your rankings. You can also use Google Search Console’s Fetch and Submit tool to submit individual pages and get a head start on your page recrawl. Note that pop-ups that allow users to choose their country or preferred language are being considered as intrusive interstitials. So you might want to look for an alternative way to present these options to users, such as using hreflang or switching to a banner.

Commentary Breitbart’s Super Bowl take: Tom Brady, victim of social media torture By James Warren • February 7, 2017 Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Good morning. Here's our morning roundup of all the media news you need to know. Want to get this briefing in your inbox every morning? Subscribe here. If only it were The Onion. But it's Breitbart News. "Liberals explode with vitriol as #NotMySuperBowlChamps trends on social media" is the headline atop this profound cultural revelation: "As the New England Patriots took yet another Super Bowl win, liberals from coast to coast exploded with vitriol on social media, furious that a team with tangential links to President Donald Trump came out on top Sunday. Since that final touchdown, the hashtag #NotMySuperBowlChamps and other similar tags have been trending." (Breitbart) Huh? "The left-wing sports media has been out for blood for the better part of a year because Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick, and team owner Robert Kraft all came out as unapologetic fans of President Trump. And now that they’ve won the Super Bowl, the left has turned apoplectic." It even bought into one tweet whose author conceded he was joking with a faux anti-left diatribe. He later wrote, "Even Breitbart thought I was being serious. I guess parody doesn't work when it's so close to the loony reality." (lamknight7) "But if I had to guess, this looks like it was made up out of whole cloth by Breitbart. Shouldn’t they be reporting on all the terrorist attacks you guys are ignoring?" said Andrew Rudalevige, a Patriots fan who's a political scientist at Bowdoin College in Maine. "Given that the goal here is to blame anything Trump can't control — like the media, like the judges — for everything that goes wrong, yes, they're serious," said Keith Olbermann, who's starring in a series of web videos called "The Resistance" for GQ. "As even the kind of quick perusal of the Goebbels approach that the late Andrew Breitbart and his cheesier successors would've made, the propaganda has to get wilder and wilder, but more importantly it has to get faster and faster, as you move forward." Some White guys have all the luck "Disney CEO Robert Iger may extend tenure again — few believe internal executives are poised to ascend and contend it would be tough for an outsider to take over in less than 16 months." (The Wall Street Journal) And some women and minorities think the system is rigged?! Quelle surprise, as the French say. Oops For a very early print edition Sunday, The Boston Globe assumed that the giant deficit faced by the New England Patriots would stand. "A Bitter End" fronted that edition. (USA Today) "While the cutline reflected that the game wasn’t over, it was below the fold. So, readers who got the early edition of the Globe were treated to a headline that boldly implied the Patriots lost." Fox's O.T. bonus "Because ad sales are about managing contingencies, Fox had pre-sold a number of bonus spots on the odd chance that Super Bowl LI would require a little temporal wiggle room, and as that prospect became a reality, other brands began making inquiries of their own." (Ad Age) "We always have overtime agreements in place, and did so this year," said Fox Networks Group Exec VP-Ad Sales Bruce Lefkowitz. "We were also garnering commitments in real-time. We would have liked the greatest Super Bowl in history to go on forever, and were prepared if it did." Headline of day "This White House list contradicts Trump’s claim the news media ignores terror attacks" (BuzzFeed) Yes, more confirmable falsehoods. Watching the government's overseas media This is from BBG Watch, a long-time, and at times decidedly contentious, newsletter by activists in an outside the Broadcast Board of Governors, which oversees media that includes the Voice of America: "Correction: An earlier version of this commentary had a reference to tweets and retweets allegedly posted on by a manager in the Voice of America Persian Service. We were subsequently informed that the Twitter account, which showed as having been started in March 2013 and, until it was shut down by last week, belonged to an impostor and not to any manager or staffer in the VOA Persian Service." "...How such an allegedly impostor VOA Persian Service director’s Twitter account could have existed for so long and be followed by the VOA Persian Service itself, as well as VOA journalists and managers, without anybody at the VOA and the BBG alerting the public that it was a fake account, is still a mystery and a stunning admission of management failure at the Voice of America and the Broadcasting Board of Governors." The take from Cambodia William Monroe, a retired former State Department official who lives half the year in Cambodia, saw a piece here about the use of social media by the right-wing. He chimes in: "Cambodia offers an interesting example of the powerful impact of social media — in expected and perhaps unexpected ways. The original view was that social media in Cambodia (use of which is surging) would help opposition parties get their message out in an environment where the government/ruling party essentially controls the media." "They have had in fact some success in this, but as the attached article argues, clever leaders can also use social media to great effect as well — at worse as 'another tool of authoritarian power.' The author may overstate the danger in the US, but worldwide this is a fascinating phenomenon to watch." (East Asia Forum) Real reason tech firms fighting Trump immigration move It's not that tech firms get much talent from any of the seven countries. But, "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 24 percent of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce in computer-related occupations is foreign-born, compared with 16.7 percent of the general U.S. workforce. That's only possible because the U.S. is so strong in the international competition for tech talent." (Bloomberg) Now a court says Google must fork over emails "Just south of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal's district, a Pennsylvania (3rd Circuit) federal judge has come to (nearly) the opposite conclusion on law enforcement's access to emails stored overseas. The first case deals with Microsoft, this with Google, in particular "two FBI SCA (Stored Communications Act) warrants seeking emails that Google says aren't stored in the United States." (TechDirt) "Google, however, also says the sought emails could be at any of its data storage sites — which would include those in the US. It all depends on when it's asked to retrieve the communications." Alas, this new decision part company with the appeals decision, which concluded that emails in an Irish data center are not subject of warrants issued by U.S. law enforcement. "The court explains Google's process for handling user data, which is built for efficiency, rather than what's central to the FBI's demands: efficiency of retrieval in response to law enforcement requests." Here's the latest ruling. Trump, Bannon vs. The Times As Trump and Steve Bannon fulminate about the awful media, notably The New York Times, they might look at both a news story and an analysis by longtime Supreme Court and legal affairs writer Adam Liptak. Smart, measured, non-judgmental, fair. On the legal issues at hand on the immigration flap: "A ruling by the court on Mr. Trump’s travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries could help answer some crucial legal questions: How much independent constitutional authority does the president have over immigration, and how much power has Congress given him?" "The likely answer to both questions: a lot. But other parts of the Constitution may temper or defeat that power. Among them are the due process and equal protection clauses and the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion." Bannon would be hard-pressed to find anything remotely as strong at, let's say, Breitbart News. Trying to keep sane "Outside of work, I don't speak very much about my job reporting on crime and violence in my hometown of Chicago anymore," writes The Chicago Tribune's William Lee. "I'm sure this is a relief to my weary friends and family." (Lee) "The truth is that I stopped talking shop outside of work for the same reason chefs don't discuss the unsavory things they witness in their work kitchens — some topics just aren't very appetizing, and few things are less enticing than the city's much discussed violence." And, as a result, "As a result, my home is a news-free zone on my off days; I'll only scan a newspaper, allow for short visits to chicagotribune.com and avoid TV news broadcasts altogether. I'm not alone, knowing plenty of other journalists who cover crime and some cops who avoid news on their own time." "Now, my mind is an endless log of murder victims' names, faces and intersections where the shootings occurred. I can feel the pain of family and friends like I couldn't as a young man." White House "rattled" by Melissa McCarthy's Sean Spicer As they should be, "White House rattled by McCarthy's spoof of Spicer." (Politico) You did see the "SNL" segment, did you not? "More than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts, it was Spicer’s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president’s eyes, according to sources close to him." "And the unflattering send-up by a female comedian was not considered helpful for Spicer’s longevity in the grueling, high-profile job, where he has struggled to strike the right balance between representing an administration that considers the media the 'opposition party,' and developing a functional relationship with the press." Does Gorsuch's claim of assisting criminal defendants matter? There was a very thoughtful pushback on a pushback on a pushback on a pushback on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC show last evening. It involved her clear sympathy for a Wall Street Journal story, mentioned here yesterday (with skepticism), that made a lot (too much) out of Neil Gorsuch's claims of having done volunteer criminal justice work while at Harvard Law School. Dahlia Lithwick, a fine legal affairs reporter for Slate, said this question was ultimately irrelevant to considering him. "This is a referendum on norms, a referendum on a stolen seat," Lithwick said, "and I always think these questions of 'Are you a good person?' as represented by these handful of behaviors never goes well. I've learned to call it sort of the cardiologic model of confirmation hearings." Maddow came back at her friend to say she felt it is in no small measure a matter of White House and Gorsuch biographical integrity. But, on this matter, Lithwick seemed far closer to getting it right during what remained an insightful exchange. "I hope this is not the main event at a confirmation hearing that might be the last best chance to talk about an independent judiciary and Donald Trump." Plus, the guy's record on prisoner rights is good, she noted, so shift the focus in any interrogation to what he thinks of Trump calling somebody a "so-called judge" and on his view of an independent judiciary, not his volunteer work 25 years ago. Cheddar inks another partnership You do have to check Cheddar, the very good sort-of CNBC for a younger crowd, especially strong on the tech sector. It's smart and fun and airs live for several hours from the New York Stock Exchange floor and Smart Flatiron Building in Manhattan. Now it will be on 60 percent of smart TVs in the U.S. as it launches on XUMO, the live and video-on-demand over-the-top digital service. It's the first network on XUMO to boast live daily shows on XUMO. Says founder Jon Steinberg, "I want people to open up their TVs, connect to the Internet, and get a taste of Cheddar. With Xumo, we achieve that for 60 percent of the new smart TVs sold in the United States. Now everyone can get the free hours we provide on Facebook right on their TV." Tiger Woods tanking What is the deal, at least to journalists who cover golf? After a long layoff, Woods returned and has been both miserable and, now, he's injured again. Says Ed Sherman, a long-time golf writer who co-hosts a golf talk radio show on WSCR in Chicago: "The history of golf is full of great players who said they would stop playing when they were no longer competitive, and they continued to play. I would think Tiger Woods would be the same way, assuming his health allows. It might be his health won't let him play anymore. The guy hasn't played a full season since 2013. There is a lot of scar tissue. Plus, the Golf Channel's Brandel Chamblee said he looked like the oldest 41-year old golfer he's ever seen." Adds Sherman, who also writes for Poynter, "Yet having said that, Woods is going to find inspiration from Darren Clarke, who won the 2011 British Open at age 42 when he was supposedly toast. He's going to look at Davis Love III winning the 2015 Wyndham Championship at age 51 after suffering through years of injury problems. He has to be thinking if they can do, I can do it." The morning babble "We get all these calls from people off the press, pushing this Bannon story," said Joe Scarborough on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," pooh-poohing notion that Steve Bannon is running the show. Still, Donny Deutsch, the ad executive-turned-bloviator, claims that Bannon is "in the business of promoting Steve Bannon" and is a leaker par excellence, a "greater self-promoter than Trump." Witness his mug on the current Time magazine profile. "Fox & Friends" went after a California state politician who said "half of my family would be eligible of deportation under the executive order." As co-host Brian Kilmeade said,"Because they don't belong here, they should be eligible for mass deportation" (though they doesn't "think they'll be targeted initially"). Steve Doocy jumped from that claim to suggest validity to Trump's claim of million of illegal voters, though, "We don't know the numbers." CNN took us to the Senate floor, where Democrats had been blabbing all night themselves to delay a confirmation vote on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. As underscored, it was a "Hail Mary" pass to find a Republican to break a 50-450 tie. Well, this made it imperative to check out C-SPAN2 where Sen. Chuck Schumer was talking to a virtually empty chamber shortly before 6:30 a.m. Eastern. He was talking about Vladimir Putin and his inclination to "go to any lengths to silence political dissidents, including murder." Its relevance to, say, charter schools was unclear but thankfully he gave way to solid, sober Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who is languorous even in the midday sun. He informed that Rhode Islanders don't think billionaire DeVos understands working people. As he spoke, The Washington Post was offering a Dana Milbank column arguing that "Democrats in the long run may thank the majority Republicans for confirming DeVos. In the fight against President Trump’s agenda, the new administration’s incompetence is their friend." The droning went on at C-Span2. Back at "Fox & Friends," there was one of its quintessential B-list debates, on media coverage of Trump, with "journalist and author" Cathy Areu defending the press and The Federalist's Bre Payton telling Doocy what he wanted to hear. Yes, yes, the press were "lapdogs" to president Obama and "now the reverse is true" as it "serves media elites and audiences." All very pedestrian. Let's hope tonight's CNN 9 p.m. health care debate between Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz is rather more engaging. Corrections? Tips? Please email me: jwarren@poynter.org.

The handset is now available, in select regions, and, according to Samsung, it radiates “quality” and “luxury”.  If you're thinking of upgrading your phone, TV or PC anytime soon, Samsung is running a 0% finance offer at the moment which gives you 0% finance for up to 24 months on orders over £249 placed. The offer ends on January 23rd, however, so you need to be quick in order to get it on time. --------------------- In the mobile space 2016 was an interesting year, a lot of cool stuff happened, and some stuff not so cool - like the Galaxy Note 7 exploding all over the place. However, in terms of the "best" phones of the year, there weren't a great many options. Of course from the Apple camp there was the iPhone 7 series; not bad, but fairly incremental, and the major overhaul is coming in 2017 by all accounts. Outside of the iOS stable, Windows Phone appears to be dead, leaving Android to clean house. Even here, however, for genuinely excellent smartphones in 2016 it pretty much narrows down to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 EDGE, the LG G5, the OnePlus 3T, and the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. And it's worth pointing out that Samsung's Galaxy S7 duo and the LG G5 both launched earliest in the year - February - so are bascially the oldest phone's of the year and are STILL kicking pretty much everything else's ass bare the offerings from Google and OnePlus. In the run-up to the big reveal, both  Galaxy S7 devices proved possibly Samsung's worst-kept secret to date, not that this is meant as a slight against Samsung - pretty much every manufacturer is unable to keep things wrapped up tight these days and in-development products always leaks onto the web in abundance. Consequently, once again much of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge design, and many of the features, are not a surprise to anyone who had been keeping an eye on things in the six months or so ahead of the launch. As per the rumours, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are not tremendously different design-wise from the Galaxy S6 series, and this is no bad thing because those devices were absolutely gorgeous, made from high-end materials, and offered a premium feel in the hand - in my opinion some of the best handsets Samsung has ever made. All good stuff. But there are still some noteworthy differences and new features to make the Galaxy S7 edge stand out from its forebears. Gloss "Pearl Black" Galaxy S7 EDGE Launches In South Korea Following a rumour trail Samsung has now officially launched the new glossy "Pearl Black" colour variant of the Galaxy S7 EDGE. Of course specs wise it is exactly the same as existing models, it is simply a new colour finish which is shiny compared to the existing matte Onyx Black, however, there is one caveat and that is it only comes in a 128GB storage variant. Sales will go live in "select markets", including South Korea, from December 9, however, Samsung is yet to reveal what other markets will receive the new handset. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Design & Display No prizes here for guessing that the Galaxy S7 edge features Samsung's unique edge display design - that's where the display panel curves around the two longer sides of the phone using flexible OLED screen technology and contoured glass. It's a signature look, and a very attractive one at that, adding a bit of unusual visual interest to make the phone more than your typical smartphone slab. However, get the Galaxy S7 edge alongside the Galaxy S7 and you'll notice another major difference - the phone's size. Last year's Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge were more-or-less the same in terms of the physical device size and display size, with a few extra millimetres here and there to accommodate the display curvature. That's all changed for 2016, with the Galaxy S7 edge being a significantly bigger model than the regular Galaxy S7 and packing a 5.5in display compared to the non-edge model's 5.1in screen. The rumours of some additional curves to the Galaxy S7 edge back panel were true, although it's a very small, subtle change that could easily be missed - on the whole it's the spitting image of its predecessor, including the welcome use of glass and metal in the same places and a selection of similar metallic colour options. Just as with the Galaxy S6 series, the build quality here is as superb as the visual design and it's a very robust feeling phone to get to grips with. Also worth noting is that the camera bump has been reduced quite significantly, although it's still not flush. If you've been following the Galaxy S7 series rumours for a while you'll know that water and dust proofing was rumoured, but, as is often the case, there were some conflicting rumours saying it wasn't so. Fortunately, the naysayers were wrong, and the waterproofing that's been missing since the Galaxy S5 has made a welcome return here. It's an IP68 certification, officially good for up to 1.5m of water for up to 30 minutes, although this is really just a legal disclaimer more than anything. At the end of the day, we want waterproofing for rain, spills, and for those rare occasions where you drop your phone in a sink/toilet/river - and in all these scenarios it should be fine. It's also worth mentioning the waterproofing has been achieved through coating of the components of the phone with protective layers, so there are no port covers or rubber grommets to contend with. The display itself is Samsung's usual high end Super AMOLED with a QHD resolution (2560 x 1440 pixels), that's the same resolution as the smaller Galaxy S6 edge display, though naturally the larger screen size means a slightly lower pixel density than both last year's model and the non-edge Galaxy S7; the Galaxy S7 edge's pixel density is 543ppi. Not that any of this is a problem of course, these are all high enough pixel densities to produce incredibly sharp picture quality, while the Super AMOLED provides the rich colour and contrast we've come to expect from Samsung flagships, as well as very good brightness, sunlight performance, and viewing angles. A new feature for the Galaxy S7 edge is the always on display (or AOD, for short)...well, it's new for Samsung's flagship series, anyway - we have seen this elsewhere before though. Of course this doesn't mean the display is literally always on, at least not completely, but it does mean that you can pick some information to be displayed even when the phone is in its sleeping state in a low-power mode. This utilises OLED tech's unique advantage - selectively powering only certain pixels. A shortlist of available display options for AOD includes calendar, clock, and notifications, although we suspect it probably has wider applications than that. As if the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge display specs weren't impressive enough just on paper, prominent display testing and analysis source DisplayMate has published its in-depth examination of the screen technology in use on both handsets. The findings are pretty glowing, to say the very least, with DisplayMate delcaring Samsung's phones as having the brightest displays it has ever tested, together with the most accurate colour it has ever tested too! "While the Galaxy S7 screen size and resolution remain the same as the Galaxy S6, its has been significantly improved for most display performance metrics. The most noticeable one is a Maximum Brightness that is 24% higher than the Galaxy S6, which is quite a significant improvement in high ambient light. The Contrast and Contrast Rating for High Ambient Light have also significantly improved," states the report. "The display on the Galaxy S7 matches and even exceeds the performance of Galaxy Note 5 that we tested in 2015 and rated it as the Best Performing Smartphone Display that we had ever tested. This is a particularly significant enhancement because the 5.1 inch Galaxy S7 display is considerably smaller so the display components had to be scaled down by 20 percent in area from the larger 5.7 inch Galaxy Note 5, and then still deliver the same Maximum Brightness from the smaller pixels." Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Hardware & Battery Another revived feature is the inclusion of a microSD card slot, which is great for multimedia collections. Samsung hasn't reintroduced a removable battery pack, however, as this is a unibody phone, but the cell has been bumped up from last year's 2600mAh to an impressive 3600mAh, just as rumours suggested. Obviously this will need testing, but a battery pack that size should offer very good performance, plus we've found the last few Samsung flagships have offered excellent battery life generally and even better with the excellent Super Power Saving mode. The Galaxy S7 EDGE battery life is noticably better than its predecessor and easily one of the best battery performers from the current crop of flagships. For a start, it's a bigger cell than the Galaxy S6 EDGE at 3,600mAh instead of the old 2,600mAh. But it also seems plenty of optimisations have been made, with the phone clocking up a 17 hours and 48 minute result in our continuous video playback test. To put that in perspective, the Galaxy S6 EDGE result was 13 hours, so you get nearly five hours more life out of the Galaxy S7 EDGE - that's most of a working day! Of course you've also got plenty of connectivity capabilities built-in, all that you might expect, including NFC, 4G LTE, and Wi-Fi. It has a microUSB port but it's not the new Type-C version. Both storage options are pretty ample with the base model being 32GB going up to a full 64GB if you're splashing out. Certainly we can see the sense in the modern app and content market of ditching a 16GB lower-tier, but although the presence of 256GB of microSD support is a welcome one it's only really any good for multimedia as Samsung hasn't implemented Android Marshmallow's native Adoptive Storage feature - in other words it can't use cards for storing apps. While the flexibility is nice, we can't help but wonder why Samsung wouldn't either open up support for Adoptive Storage OR introduce a 128GB top-tier storage model above the 64GB one. Without either option, some power users may be in for a tricky time, but most users shouldn't have too much of a problem. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Processor Samsung has pulled its usual trick of shipping different processor models in different regions - the Samsung Exynos and the Qualcomm Snapdragon. Officially the firm has said that CPU performance will be 30% faster than the Galaxy S6 series while the GPU has a 64% uplift. Samsung does have an interesting and rather PC-like solution to performance-related heat this time as well - the handset contains a heat pipe filled with water, and when the SoC heats up the water turns to vapour before being cooled via a heatsink. Smart. Interestingly, Youtube channel JerryRigEverything has now released a video showing the Galaxy S7 edge being dismantled on camera - in case you were wondering what its insides looked like. As well as being quite cool generally, the video showcases the heat-pipe setup from around the 4:30 mark. Video of Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Replacement - Charging Port Repair - battery fix Having spent a bit of time with a few other high-end 2016 Android phones using similar processor setups, I can say that the Exynos 8890-based Galaxy S7 EDGE is definitely in a similar ballpark. In general operation things are silky smooth for navigating Android and hopping between apps, and even when playing intensive 3D games this phone definitely packs a punch. I can't say I noticed any latency issues or lag whatsoever, even when trying to deliberately push the device out of its comfort zone, although it must be said the back panel did heat up a fair bit. Benchmarks tests do show that the Snapdragon 820 edition does ever-so-slightly outperform the Exynos hardware, in particular when it comes to graphics, but the main takeaway here is the difference between the two in most scenarios is a handful of frames-per-second; importantly not enough to be noticeable in actual real-world use. A quick glance at most benchmarking test results and databases online shows that the Galaxy S7 EDGE Exynos model is still one of the top performing smartphones on the market, and I for one think this is reflected in actual operation. NOTHING seems to shake this handset, it just waltzes through whatever you throw at it effortlessly. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Camera Typical of Samsung's flagship series both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge feature the same camera setup and, again, the rumours were spot on here with a 12MP sensor. That's a lower megapixel rating than previous models, but this is entirely deliberate as Samsung, like many other Android OEMs, has focused on improving other areas of the camera hardware. The sensor uses a higher-rated 1.4um pixels, up from the Galaxy S6, to help with noise reduction, alongside a very wide f/1.7 aperture (last year's was f/1.9 - lower ratings are wider and therefore preferable in allowing in more light), and super-fast dual-pixel phase detection.  Sensor: 12MP, 1/2.6" Aperture: f/1.7 Pixel Size: 1.4 µm Focal Length: 26mm Flash: Dual-LED Features: Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS), dual-pixel phase detection autofocus, simultaneous video and still capture, touch focus, HDR (auto), face and smile detection, panoramic capture, motion panorama, wide angle selfie, "hyperlapse", motion photo Video: 4K, 1080p, 720p Secondary Specs (Sensor, Aperture, Focal Length): 5MP, f/1.7, 22mm I've consistently been impressed by Samsung's camera setups for years now and with the Galaxy S7 this doesn't show any signs of changing. Yes, the sensor has a lower 12MP rating than the Galaxy S6's 16MP setup, but then again so does every major flagship on the market right now because, across the board, OEMs have finally twigged that more MP doesn't mean better image quality all on its own. Thus, plenty of other aspects of the imaging setup have been tweaked instead, including a very large aperture, pixel, and sensor size, resulting in much sharper details and less noise. The Galaxy S6's imaging capabilities were already impressive, but this is even more so.  The dynamic range is very capable as you can see between the shaded roof area and the brightly illuminated street. I also remain very fond of Samsung's approach to photography which is similar to its displays, that is; it is not afraid of punchy colour saturation and contrast. The result of this is really vibrant images, whether that's capturing a really bright blue sky on a sunny day, lush green vegetation, colourful flowers, or the crisp contrast on that statue head pictured below.  As you can see from this coffee bean shot, close-up work still gets plenty of detail and crispness. Capture speed is lightning quick thanks to the dual-pixel phase detection autofocus and this together with the detail-intensive sensor/aperture AND OIS means there's very little chance of picking up any blurriness. The camera interface is nice and simple to use too. Just as with the last few generations of Samsung flagships, here again I am a big fan of the ease-of-use with Samsung's camera hardware and software. Too often there are mobile camera configurations which, while actually sometimes a bit more capable in terms of image fidelity, are frustratingly complex to actually get the best results. I am far happier with Samsung's compromise, it makes me willing to actually use the camera and feel confident I will get good pictures from it, where with rivals, even if I know I can get a decent photo, I also know I will have to faff so much I rarely have the patience to even bother. It must be said, that even these rival cameras which are technically better in terms of image quality (for example, Microsoft's high-end Lumia PureView models) are not very far ahead of the Galaxy S7 at all, while the Galaxy S7 is tons more fun to use and consistently able to produce images you're proud of. For those who do want to fine-tune their photography the Galaxy S7 does include a "Pro" mode for manual control for key features like focus, brightness, ISO, exposure, and more. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Software Of course the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE runs Android Marshmallow with a new build of TouchWiz over the top of it, but with that said it doesn't seem massively different from the build currently rolling out to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 EDGE. As with that build, there are enhancements to the EDGE display functions, which now allow for gesture controls and a wider selection of apps to be used - there's also more room on the edge for more apps, shortcuts and info to be displayed. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Price & Availability Major UK networks have pricing plan details for both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The following network deals are for 24 month contracts for the 32GB Galaxy S7 edge and on all mentioned networks it can be purchased in either Black Onyx or Gold Platinum colour options. EE - £9.99 Up-front and £54.99 per month O2 - £9.99 Up-front and £51 per month Vodafone - £9 Up-front and £56 per month Three - £49 Up-front and £47 per month - Pre-order by March 6 to receive handset by March 8; three days earlier than general release on March 11. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Conclusion A tremendously pleasing smartphone to use. It's been a while since I test-drove something I didn't want to give back, but the Galaxy S7 EDGE fits into that category quite comfortably. It looks sharp, feels reassuringly expensive and robust in the hand, the camera experience is an absolute joy. Performance is what you hope for from a flagship; it's fast, smooth and responsive, while the battery life is amongst the best available. The software is as close to stock Android as Samsung has ever come and as a result is one of the most hassle-free Samsung Galaxy devices I've used to date. Fancy picking yourself up a bargain?

More videos Identity theft on the increase Veda, a credit information bureau, found cases of identity theft rose 80 per cent from 2015 to 2016. "KB" owns two businesses and left Australia for a two-week holiday in Italy.  On arrival at Rome International Airport a payment on KB's credit card was declined. KB discovered an automated alert by Veda had been sent to his credit card providers, the National Australia Bank, American Express and Citibank. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Timothy Pilgrim, Australian Privacy Commissioner, found Veda had breached KB's privacy.  Photo: Jeremy Piper KB's businesses were also affected as he had provided details of his Citibank Visa credit card for payment to his suppliers. He received calls from suppliers advising him they had tried to charge the credit card but payment did not go through. They advised that until they were paid, goods would not be supplied. It turns out KB has a similar name and resides in the same apartment building as a person the court had recorded a $7000 debt against. Veda's automatic matching systems drew a connection between the judgment and KB and recorded information about the judgment on KB's credit file. Advertisement Veda's systems then provided an automated alert to KB's registered creditors and it wasn't until KB returned to Australia and called Veda to order a copy of his credit report that he was able to identify the incorrectly listed report. KB advised Veda of the mistake and requested the urgent removal of the listing but Veda said KB had to approach the court for correction and indicated it would not take action until it heard from the court.   KB had to engage a lawyer to assist him in corresponding to the court and having his credit file corrected. Compensation  KB had to turn to the privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim to receive compensation. The privacy commissioner found Veda interfered with KB's privacy by not taking reasonable steps to ensure the credit information it collected and disclosed was accurate, up to date and complete, using or disclosing credit reporting information that was false or misleading.   Often you don't know they've put a black mark against you until it's too late. Peter Strong Veda was ordered to issue a written apology, commence a procedural review and pay KB $15,830. "It appears that Veda incorrectly assumed that the information provided by the court contained typographical errors, and as a consequence, wrongly included the court judgment on the complainant's credit file. It took no steps to confirm that was the case before including the listing on the complainant's credit file," the privacy commissioner found.  He found Veda placed "an undue burden" on individuals to identify errors in their credit reports and draw them to its attention.  "It was not reasonable in the circumstances for Veda to assume that the identifying information which it had collected from the court contained typographical errors, without taking any steps to confirm that this was the case," the privacy commissioner found.  "Listing a judgment on an individual's credit file can have serious consequences for the individual in question, and is a step that should not be taken lightly."  The onus is on small business owners Philippa Hill, spokeswoman for Veda, says "the error occurred due to multiple identical pieces of critical information". The error was "subsequently removed" from KB's file.  Hill says that in addition to court judgments, there are multiple things that can impact the credit rating of a business, including how fast they pay their invoices, any commercial defaults on their credit file, inquiry patterns and the history of how the owner runs their other businesses. "A lender may, with consent, look at an individual's personal credit file in deciding whether to extend credit to a business owner. Small business owners should ensure they are aware of what is on their personal credit file." Getting through is impossible The lack of recourse to credit agencies, such as Veda is difficult for small businesses according to Peter Strong, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Australia. "This isn't a government agency you can go to and complain about, it is the private sector, so what do you do?", he says. "There's no recourse that you can have besides going to court so it is quite a concern."   Strong says the privacy commissioner's findings against Veda are "extraordinary". "Often you don't know that they've put a black mark against you until it's way too late.  That could bankrupt a business, if you're getting a bad name with your suppliers when you have done nothing wrong, it is a real red flag. Getting through to them is really impossible." Not the first breach This isn't the first time Veda has come under scrutiny from the privacy commissioner. Last year the commissioner found Veda had breached privacy rules when it sold commercial products to consumers who simply wanted a copy of their credit report, which, by law, they're able to access for free once a year.

By Jordan Robertson. Added by Agency Staff on 7 February 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Chuck Robbins, Cisco, Facebook, Gartner, Google, Naresh Singh, SnapRoute Tweet Of all the lasting effects of Edward Snowden’s leaks, there’s one photo that leaves a particularly strong mark. In it, US federal government employees in t-shirts and blue jeans are seen intercepting network equipment from Cisco at a shipping facility. The feds in the photo, their faces obscured, were reprogramming the machines to spy on people’s activities. The image captured a deeply held paranoia within Silicon Valley’s biggest Internet companies: in an era of increasingly sophisticated nation-state hacking, how can we trust that network infrastructure isn’t compromised before it’s dropped off at the company loading docks? This fear has created a sense of urgency for Apple, Google, Facebook and other technology giants that have been devising their own alternatives to Cisco, which controls more than half of the market for network equipment. After the photo was published, Cisco filed a public complaint with the White House, arguing that spying by the National Security Agency was hurting US companies. Cisco said it doesn’t work with governments on back doors for its products and maintains tight checks on its processes and supply chain to assure customers of their security. While Cisco’s dominance isn’t in danger of slipping any time soon, the industry’s creeping concerns over cybersecurity have created an opening for new businesses and equipment-design skunkworks inside large companies. In the three years since the Snowden leaks, networking software and equipment startups raised US$6,4bn, a 47% increase over the prior three years, according to researcher CB Insights. “We’ve lost confidence in the vendors in the wake of the Snowden revelations, and that is a weakness and an opportunity,” said John Kindervag, a vice president at market analysis firm Forrester Research. One company that’s benefiting is SnapRoute, which was founded by a former manager of Apple’s global data centre network. The start-up makes a cheaper, simpler network switch than the ones Cisco sells. And unlike most switches, it’s open-source, allowing customers to look for bugs, performance glitches or back doors that might allow a government to peek inside. SnapRoute plans to announce a $25m round of funding on Tuesday from AT&T, Microsoft, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Norwest Venture Partners. The start-up counts Facebook among its customers. Facebook is also a founding member of the Open Compute Project, which develops and shares open-source data centre designs. It launched the project in 2011 after revealing details about a data centre it built in Prineville, Oregon using only Facebook-designed servers, power supplies and backup systems. Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft are now members. So is Cisco. It’s playing along with a potential competitor because Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins has said the company needs to be “part of every technology discussion that our customers want to have”. The high cost of traditional networking products was the main reason for Amazon.com’s investment into creating its own equipment. “It was cost that caused us to head down our own path,” James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished hardware engineer for Amazon Web Services, said at a conference in November. “Networking gear is really expensive.” Besides looking to save a lot of money on premium equipment, companies are placing a higher value on transparency. Cisco guards its code and designs, making them difficult to repair when things break. Bloomberg Businessweek reported in September that a Web hosting company filed for bankruptcy protection after a series of Cisco switches failed and a major customer left, while Cisco worked for months on a fix. Cisco has declined to comment on that case, saying only that it tries to fix problems quickly. By 2020, spending on open-source and self-built switches and other network technologies will account for at least 20% of the global data centre market, up from less than 2% last year, according to researcher Gartner. Big Switch Networks, Cumulus Networks, Pluribus Networks and SnapRoute are among the companies cultivating a niche that’s putting pressure on leaders Cisco and Juniper Networks and their proprietary code, said Naresh Singh, an analyst at Gartner. The giants are already under pressure from software-based networking alternatives like SnapRoute’s, and the adoption of open-source tools from mega users, such as Facebook and Goldman Sachs, poses an even bigger threat to their businesses, Singh said. Cisco said some companies baulk at using open-source network equipment, citing maintenance “complexity and hidden costs”. SnapRoute founder Jason Forrester said the idea for his start-up came from a key discovery he and his colleagues at Apple made when they began designing their own networking software and switches. Forrester (no relation to the market research firm) left Apple in 2015 but declined to talk in detail about his work there. “Switching wasn’t as hard as Cisco and others led customers to believe,” he said at SnapRoute’s offices in an industrial part of Palo Alto, California, located 16km from Apple’s campus. Switches from SnapRoute are $30 000 to $40 000 cheaper than comparable brand-name models, Forrester said. And whereas switches from Cisco and other big suppliers can have tens of millions of lines of code, SnapRoute’s has just 22 000, he said. This means fewer features, so SnapRoute may not be an attractive option for some companies. But the simpler code makes it easier for customers to sift through in search of hidden spying devices.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Reported with assistance from Ian King Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 22‘Please call me’ man hits back at Vodacom 8Set-top box dispute goes to arbitration 5ICT white paper a big risk to SA [podcast] 4Watch: Chaos erupts in parliament 3Uber CEO quits Trump advisory council Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Sebastian Anthony (UK) - Feb 7, 2017 1:38 pm UTC Google Brain reader comments 172 Share this story Google Brain has devised some new software that can create detailed images from tiny, pixelated source images. Google's software, in short, basically means the "zoom in... now enhance!" TV trope is actually possible. Enlarge Google BrainFirst, take a look at the image on the right. The left column contains the pixelated 8×8 source images, and the centre column shows the images that Google Brain's software was able to create from those source images. For comparison, the real images are shown in the right column. As you can see, the software seemingly extracts an amazing amount of detail from just 64 source pixels. Of course, as we all know, it's impossible to create more detail than there is in the source image—so how does Google Brain do it? With a clever combination of two neural networks. The first part, the conditioning network, tries to map the the 8×8 source image against other high resolution images. It downsizes other high-res images to 8×8 and tries to make a match. Left column: source image. Other columns: various outputs produced by the neural networks. There's a bit of variation. Fourth celebrity from the bottom is particularly scary. Google Brain Input: left column. Fourth column: the original image. Other columns: various super-resolution techniques. NN = nearest neighbour (looking for a high-res image in the dataset that closely matches the 8x8 image) Google Brain Google Brain Various different super-resolution techniques. The three right-most columns are the Google Brain method. Google Brain The second part, the prior network, uses an implementation of PixelCNN to try and add realistic high-resolution details to the 8×8 source image. Basically, the prior network ingests a large number of high-res real images—of celebrities and bedrooms in this case. Then, when the source image is upscaled, it tries to add new pixels that match what it "knows" about that class of image. For example, if there's a brown pixel towards the top of the image, the prior network might identify that as an eyebrow: so, when the image is scaled up, it might fill in the gaps with an eyebrow-shaped collection of brown pixels. To create the final super-resolution image, the outputs from the two neural networks are mashed together. The end result usually contains the plausible addition of new details. Google Brain's super-resolution technique was reasonably successful in real-world testing. When human observers were shown a real high-resolution celebrity face vs. the upscaled computed image, they were fooled 10 percent of the time (50 percent would be a perfect score). For the bedroom images, 28 percent of humans were fooled by the computed image. Both scores are much more impressive than normal bicubic scaling, which fooled no human observers. One of the best videos of all time.

The added details—known as "hallucinations" in image processing jargon—are a best guess and nothing more. This raises some intriguing issues, especially in the realms of surveillance and forensics. This technique could take a blurry image of a suspect and add more detail—zoom! enhance!—but it wouldn't actually be a real photo of the suspect. It might very well help the police find the suspect, though. Google Brain and DeepMind are two of Alphabet's deep learning research arms. The former has published some interesting research recently, such as two AIs creating their own cryptographic algorithm; the latter, of course, was thrust into the limelight last year when its AlphaGo AI defeated the world's best Go players.

The inside story of the rise and rise of Uber Posted Feb 7, 2017 by John Biggs (@johnbiggs) 0 SHARES Next Story HPE becomes a Mesosphere reseller Advertisement Brad Stone’s new book, The Upstarts, recounts the surprising rise – and possible fall – of the sharing economy. By looking at Uber and AirBnB, Stone brings life and drama to the origin stories of how a few lucky guys made the right decisions at exactly the right time. What follows is an excerpt detailing the rise of Uber. Back in the summer of 2013, just as Silicon Valley investors were moving from optimism to outright exuberance, Travis Kalanick set out to raise Uber’s fourth round of financing. Colleagues say Kalanick set the terms of the financing round himself. He initiated discussions with half a dozen large investors and ran the process as an auction, searching not just for the most capital at the highest valuation, but for a powerful partner who could facilitate Uber’s coming global expansion. Yuri Milner’s fund, Digital Sky Technologies, was involved in the bidding, as was the venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners. But ultimately Kalanick’s attention settled on the dominant technology company in the land—Google. Kalanick started talks with Google’s investment division, Google Capital, but gravitated to its older venture capital group, Google Ventures, or GV, and one of its partners, David Krane. Krane was an early Google PR manager turned investor with a penchant for wearing colorful designer sneakers. He wooed Kalanick with a vision of Google’s sixty thousand employees whose collective energies and 20 percent free time at work could be deployed to aid the Uber cause. Kalanick was intrigued by the idea of aligning himself with Google but wanted reassurances from the top and asked for a meeting with founder and CEO Larry Page. So one evening in August 2013, Kalanick checked into a suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in East Palo Alto, paid for by Google, and woke up the next morning for a ten o’clock meeting with the most powerful man in Silicon Valley. Krane had orchestrated an experience that would blow Kalanick’s mind. When Uber’s CEO came down to the lobby, a prototype driverless car from the Google X lab idled in front of the hotel, waiting to ferry him to Mountain View. Sitting in the front seat was a Google engineer who could answer all his questions. It was Kalanick’s first ride in a self-driving car on real roads. At the Google campus, Kalanick met with Page, Google senior lawyer David Drummond, and Krane’s boss at GV at the time, Bill Maris. Page assured Kalanick that the companies could work together to develop Google Maps, which Uber relied on for navigation in its apps, but he didn’t say much or stay very long. The more important legacy that day was Kalanick’s developing awareness of the technology that might radically change Uber’s business. “The minute your car becomes real, I can take the dude out of the front seat,” Kalanick told Krane excitedly after the meeting. “I call that margin expansion.” In Kalanick’s estimation, payments to drivers were contra-revenue—a deduction from the top line. The inevitable future of robot cars was going to be awfully good for his business, he surmised. Krane thought he’d sealed an exclusive investment for Google Ventures after a subsequent four-hour meeting with Kalanick and Uber’s head of finance, former Goldman Sachs exec Gautam Gupta. But it wasn’t done quite yet. That night, Kalanick called Krane and told him he also wanted to include a second investor in the round: TPG Capital, the San Francisco private equity firm that had engineered leveraged buyouts of such companies as Continental Airlines, J. Crew, and Burger King. Kalanick wanted the experience and connections of TPG’s legendary founding partner David Bonderman, then a board member at General Motors, and thought he could help Uber with its regulatory problems around the world. Google invested $258 million in the ridesharing company. David Drummond joined the Uber board, while Krane joined as a board observer. TPG invested $88 million, buying shares directly from founder Garrett Camp and obtaining a provision that allowed the firm to get additional shares if Uber’s valuation ever fell below $2.75 billion, says a person familiar with the deal. Clearly nervous about investing in a startup, the private equity firm was hedging its bets; it also received an option to buy another $88 million worth of stock at the same price within six months. David Bonderman joined the Uber board as a director while his colleague David Trujillo, who had orchestrated the investment, joined as a board observer. (Bench- mark also invested another $15 million, and the rapper and entrepreneur Jay Z agreed to invest $2 million—then wired Uber $5 million, hoping for a larger stake. Although Kalanick was impressed by the brash move, he returned the difference.) Uber’s coffers were now brimming. After the round closed, Kalanick climbed aboard TPG’s Gulfstream jet with Bonderman, TPG co-founder James Coulter, and Trujillo, as well as investor Shervin Pishevar and his partner Scott Stanford, to visit countries in Asia and gauge the company’s expansion opportunities there. The world seemed wide open. Yet nearly every assumption Kalanick and his investors were making about the future in the fall of 2013 turned out, in the end, to be at least partially incorrect. Google was reluctant to cede the results of its driverless car research to another company and would soon look more like Uber’s mortal enemy, not its ally. Within a year, David Bonderman would leave the board of General Motors, which in 2016 would make a sizable investment in archrival Lyft. And remarkably, according to multiple people familiar with the transaction, when the time came for TPG to purchase its second $88 million allotment of Uber shares at the same valuation, the private equity firm wavered and waited until the last possible moment before attempting to exercise the option. Characteristically stingy about giving out Uber stock and diluting the ownership stakes of existing investors, Kalanick declined the transaction. Calculating for the dramatic rise in Uber’s value between that round and the end of 2016, TPG’s lack of faith ended up costing the firm hundreds of millions in unrealized gains. The biggest miscalculations may have been Kalanick’s own. Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Asia would prove more challenging and costly than he had ever anticipated. He especially misread the atmospheric shifts in Silicon Valley’s fund-raising climate. “Emil,” he had said gleefully to Emil Michael, his new vice president of business development, after closing the investment from Google and TPG, “we’re never going to have to fund-raise again.” Emil Michael was disappointed to learn that Kalanick thought Uber’s financing efforts were over—he considered fund-raising one of his talents. Born in Cairo, Michael had immigrated with his family to the United States as an infant, graduated from high school in New Rochelle, New York, and earned an undergraduate degree from Harvard University and a law degree from Stanford. He had a brief stint at Goldman Sachs before decamping to Silicon Valley in 1999, right at the peak of the dot-com bubble. During his ten years in the industry, Michael had cultivated a reputation as being effective, loyal, and upbeat. He first met Kalanick in 2011, when he was taking a hiatus from high tech to work in the White House as a special assistant to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Kalanick tried to recruit him to join the startup, but at the time Uber looked like a luxury town-car service, not a worldwide transportation juggernaut. Michael was skeptical that it could ever be a big business. But Michael remained friendly with Kalanick and by the time he joined Uber, in the fall of 2013, he recognized that Uber’s future was brighter than he had originally believed. While Uber Black remained one and a half times more expensive than a traditional yellow taxi, UberX was, on average, 25 percent less expensive and was starting to dominate the emerging rideshare wars. Lyft and Sidecar had introduced ridesharing, but when Uber started aggressively rolling out the service, first in the United States in 2013 and then in Europe in 2014, the two rivals struggled to keep up. Uber had a more established brand and more money in the bank as well as upscale product lines, like Uber Black and Uber SUV, whose profits could be used to subsidize UberX rides and offer financial incentives to new drivers. Uber was growing 20 percent each month and, thanks to UberX, had gone from nonexistent to ubiquitous nearly overnight in San Francisco, Los Angeles, DC, and Boston. That fall, Uber had moved out of its cramped offices on Howard Street to more spacious digs a few blocks away, on the ninth floor of 706 Mission Street, around the corner from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Kalanick’s desk was across from Emil Michael’s, and the two would often peer at each other over their computer screens to marvel at new growth statistics. “We’d have these moments, asking each other, ‘Did you see this thing?’ ” Michael says. “It just kept going.” Some U.S. cities, such as Austin, Las Vegas, Denver, and Miami, resisted the arrival of unregulated ridesharing; amusingly, New Orleans sent Uber a cease-and-desist letter before it was even operating there. But Kalanick still had his trusty playbook as well as the political theorem known as Travis’s Law, which dictated that politicians accountable to the people could be pressured to accommodate any service that was markedly better than the alternative. In October 2013, most of Uber’s four hundred employees flew to Miami on another workation, staying in rooms in the ritzy Shore Club in South Beach. When employees weren’t at dinners or parties around the hotel pool, which had the giant U from the Uber logo illuminated on the water, they walked the beach handing out Uber postcards and affixing pro-Uber posters to light poles. The company’s campaign to drum up popular support to legalize ride-sharing in South Florida had a website, an Instagram page, and a Twitter hash tag: #MiamiNeedsUber. Miami was a challenging market for Uber. Private for-hire limos and sedans were required by law to wait an hour before picking up passengers and had to charge more than seventy dollars for the ride. The ordinance was backed by the region’s taxi fleets and meant to keep them safe from loosely regulated competition from limos and town cars. It didn’t stand a chance against sustained popular demand for ridesharing. Lyft and then Uber would open for business in Miami-Dade a few months after the visit by Uber employees. Though the companies’ services were still technically illegal, courts only occasionally levied fines against drivers, and the police didn’t shut down either service. By 2015, lawmakers were ready to change the rules. “Demand is too great,” Miami mayor Carlos Gimenez told the Miami Herald. “I’m not going to drag Uber and Lyft back into the 20th century. I think the taxi industry has to move into the 21st.” Uber was entering adolescence, winning political battles, growing, and adding executive talent. A few months before Emil Michael joined the company, Kalanick had also recruited a new chief technology officer, Thuan Pham.

Joining Uber as a senior executive meant a grueling interview process that included a cumulative thirty hours of one-on-one conversations with Kalanick. Pham reorganized Uber’s technical team, accelerated the hiring of engineers, and oversaw a complete revision of its dispatch algorithms and database storage systems to keep up with a business that was doubling every six months and showing no signs of slowing down. Pham’s impact at Uber was evident on New Year’s Eve, typically a night of frantic activity that had overwhelmed Uber’s systems for three straight years. “Thuan, if we have a system breakdown, I’m going to have an aneurysm and my death will be on your hands,” Kalanick told him earlier that day. But for the first time, Uber’s systems survived the night relatively unscathed. A few days later, Kalanick took Pham and his team out for a celebratory dinner and offered a rare bit of praise. “You did a great job,” Uber’s CEO said. Characteristically, the praise came with a new challenge. “From here on out, anything you can predict, I expect you to handle.” Over the next few months, Kalanick executed two ideas that further propelled the growth of UberX. The first, helping Uber drivers finance the lease of new vehicles, originated with former Goldman Sachs commodities trader Andrew Chapin, who was working as a driver operations manager in Uber’s New York office. Chapin had observed that the biggest obstacle facing many prospective Uber drivers was the lack of a vehicle; a lot of them didn’t own cars because they were immigrants with bad credit or no credit. Chapin thought Uber could help drivers obtain car leases and then divert a certain percentage of their earnings toward paying them off. The arrangement would pay dividends for the company, not only by putting more cars on the road but by ensuring that drivers devoted their energies to Uber rather than to rival ridesharing or delivery services. “The demand is there, but if we don’t help our partners and drivers get cars on the road, then it just doesn’t matter. We’re just not going to be able to grow,” Kalanick said that year. To canvass for interest in such a program, Uber executives visited car companies and auto-loan financers around the country. Their initial reaction was skepticism. “The car companies were like, ‘Yoober? Who are you guys? Aren’t you the town-car company?’ ” Emil Michael recalls. Kalanick, Michael, and investor Bill Gurley visited the Detroit offices of Ford Motor Company, often referred to as “The Glass House,” and met with executive chair- man William Clay Ford Jr., who was also noncommittal. Kalanick got a photo of himself with Ford, the great-grandson of founder Henry Ford, plus a tour of the company’s historic displays in the lobby, where Gurley recalls the Uber CEO got lost in reading about the automaker’s storied past. Ultimately, the big carmakers, GM, Toyota, and Ford, would sign on to the program, as would dealerships and auto lenders, and in time Uber would bring the financing in-house and make loans through its own subsidiary, Xchange. The program would be criticized for offering subprime loans with onerous terms and for repossessing vehicles when drivers didn’t make their payments on time. Michael argued that the program helped credit-challenged drivers who simply had no other options. “You are taking people who are already getting killed on loans and doing something better for them,” he says. “Of course the interest rate is high, but at least they have a chance.” While driver loans helped stimulate the supply of Uber cars, a second move helped to spark demand and was just as controversial. In early 2014, hoping to improve business during the annual winter slowdown, when people curtailed their nights out, Kalanick cut UberX fares by up to 30 percent in U.S. markets like Atlanta, Balti- more, Chicago, and Seattle. The theory was that if prices went down, customers would use the service more and bypass rental cars, public buses, and subways. With more passengers, drivers would spend less time idling between rides, replacing the lost income from the fare cuts by completing more rides. While the plan made sense, subsequent fare cuts would create unrest among drivers, and Uber would eventually have to reverse them in cities where lower prices didn’t spark higher demand. But it also accelerated the growth of UberX and, perhaps just as important, forced the less highly capitalized Lyft to introduce its own fare and commission cuts. Uber had discovered what startup gurus like to call the virtuous circle, the links between various parts of its business. Lower prices led to more customers and more frequent usage, which led to a larger supply of cars and busier drivers, which enabled Uber to further cut prices and put more pressure on competitors. Even Uber’s most fervent supporters had not grasped the true potential of the business. Uber wasn’t just taking passengers out of yellow cabs, it was growing the overall market for paid transportation. “I knew Uber was going to be big, but I didn’t know it was going to be so outlandish,” says venture capitalist Bill Gurley. “When we started testing lower price points, that’s when it was really ‘Oh my God.’ The price elasticity was impressive.” The increasing pace of the business surprised Kalanick himself. “I didn’t understand the scope of the Uber opportunity and I didn’t understand how the private equity and venture worlds would go to massively unprecedented places in order to be a part of that opportunity,” he says. Nothing could stop Uber now, it seemed, except perhaps itself. THE UPSTARTS by Brad Stone. Copyright © 2017 by Brad Stone.

PINPOINT THE PROBLEM It could be an app, multiple apps, the storage or the system itself slowing down your device. Before you either fix your device yourself or give it to a technician to help you fix it, it is important you try to identify what the problem is or might be, and what the problem isn’t. With this knowledge, the problem will be easier for you to solve on your own or, if you decide to give the phone to a technician instead, it will help you avoid being cheated. A diagnostic app can help you pinpoint the problem causing your device to run slowly. Phone Doctor Plus and Z-device Test are good diagnostic apps to consider. You can find them on Google Play Store. Some Android devices come with diagnostic apps, like Samsung with the Samsung Smart Care app. In this case, you can take advantage of that rather than downloading another from the Google Play Store.   CLEAR YOUR CACHED DATA This is more or less a temporary solution if your device’s slowness is caused by the unnecessary or ‘rarely used’ apps you installed. Cache data eats up system resources (takes up storage space on your device) while slowing down your device. You should clear this data from time to time or install a cache clearing app, like Clean Master, from the Google Play Store. You have nothing to fear deleting this data, anything important will simply be re-cached the next time you open the app. This is considered a temporary solution because you’ll eventually have to delete some of these apps you are clearing the cached data of, to more permanently fix the problem of your device running slowly.   UNINSTALL AND DISABLE UNNECESSARY APPS If after diagnosing the problem, you find that a certain app or the multiple apps you installed on your device is causing your device to run slowly, you should immediately uninstall it. For apps that you cannot delete (those that come preloaded on your phone and are otherwise called ‘bloatware’), you should disable as many as you are not using to keep them from running in the background, choking your device’s storage and interfering with its speed and efficiency. You can uninstall or disable apps through the app manager found in your device’s settings, and keep these apps from becoming the ‘resource hogs’ that slow down your Android device. NOTE – You should also learn to close all apps you are no longer using. Don’t just open it and change to another app without closing the one you previously opened. This helps to free up your RAM and improve your device’s performance.   FREE UP YOUR DEVICE STORAGE Aside uninstalling unnecessary apps, especially if the problem is caused by insufficient storage, you should also delete some of the many files (music, videos, documents etc.) that are filling up your internal storage. Make the sacrifice; delete those files you don’t actually need but keep for sentimental reasons. If you want to avoid, losing certain files completely, you can transfer them to another device (another phone, a laptop, or a tablet) or a flash drive or hard drive. NOTE – You can also consider disabling some of the widgets running on your device that you are not really using, alongside animations and live wallpapers you have running on your phone. Widgets, animations and live wallpapers may be fanciful, but they affect your device’s performance and battery live.   PERFORM A FACTORY DATA RESET Over time, a lot goes on in your device’s software so it’s always advisable to give your device a fresh start from time to time. Know that this should not be done often, only from time to time especially when all the other tips don’t work as well as you want them to do. A factory data reset will wipe your device clean and leave the software the way it was when you first turned on the device; so be sure to backup important files before you do this. Some Android devices come with a “Backup and Reset” option in the device’s settings, so you can take advantage of that. Some other devices have a recovery menu for backing up important files. The steps are different for every device, so you can use Google to help you out with the steps for your device.   Comments: This article has 0 comment, leave your comment.

With support from Google News Lab， as well as Facebook's verification tools， the collaborative project named CrossCheck seeks to "help the public make sense of what and who to trust." "Dedicated tools and media literacy efforts" of Facebook will help with the project's verification process and "keep relevant audience up to date with confirmed and disputed information relating to the election." The CrossCheck project gathered seventeen French and international news agencies and media groups like AFP， France Medias Monde and BuzzFeed News， as well as the network community called Global Voices， which relies on writers， translators， bloggers and citizen journalists to report on popular topics in citizen media worldwide. "Each participating newsroom will contribute their own experience， resources and regional knowledge to speed and strengthen the verification process， and to ensure that accurate reports reach citizens across the country and beyond，" according to a statement released on First Draft News. The official announcement encouraged the public to submit disputed websites and content on the French presidential election to CrossCheck for further investigation， while final answers would be published on a dedicated website. Media and technology experts would check out the credibility of certain reports， debunk hoaxes， rumors and false claims， as well as ensure accurate reports on controversial and confusing stories， the statement added. The French presidential election is slated for April and the project is an attempt to prevent inaccurate and unproven information to influence the election campaign and results. Social media networks like Facebook and Twitter have been criticized for allegedly propagating fake stories on their platforms during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. | PRINT | RSS SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google this week made it simpler for mobile device users to share AMP articles. AMP articles are specially formatted for viewing on mobile devices and load faster than standard web sites. The way Google delivers AMP articles to Google Search requires the use of headers in the URL. The headers, while necessary, extend the length of URLs and makes them awkward to share. Moving forward, articles displayed in the AMP view in Google Search on Android devices will include an anchor button that exposes the canonical URL for easier sharing. Users can long press the URL and then share it as they are used to via the browser's standard sharing tools. Google says this feature is rolling out to the Google Search app for Android in the days ahead. Further, Google says the Android Google app will be able to share the original URL when users tap on the app's share button, a feature already available to iOS devices, in the weeks ahead. Google Search is free to download from the App Store. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

There is no argument about Google being a reliable and popular search engine How Do Search Engines Work? How Do Search Engines Work? To many people, Google IS the internet. It's arguably the most important invention since the Internet itself. And while search engines have changed a lot since, the underlying principles are still the same. Read More . But if you are interested in one that suits your specific interest, search type, or desire to help others, then check out these awesome seven alternatives. For Privacy Concerns If you are looking for a search engine that cares about your privacy, one of these two options might be just what you need. 1. DuckDuckGo When it comes to keeping your personal information safe, DuckDuckGo flies to the top of the search engine list. As their policy states, they do not collect or share your personal details, store your search history, or track you, even when you are using private browsing mode. Like Google, DuckDuckGo offers categories at the top to narrow down your search, like web, images, or videos. And depending on your search term 8 Search Tricks That Work on DuckDuckGo but Not on Google 8 Search Tricks That Work on DuckDuckGo but Not on Google Google Search is king. But DuckDuckGo has earned a loyal fan following. It has a few unusual features that even Google doesn't have. Read More , those may change from products to recipes to news. The search engine also contains a couple of filters that you can apply. What you will notice about DuckDuckGo when you first search is that the results page is not paginated. So rather than scrolling a short way and clicking to move to the next page of results, you will see them all on one page with a Load More option. Alternatively, you can jump to specific sections of results that are displayed at the top. So depending on your search results display preference in relation to your privacy concerns, DuckDuckGo is certainly worth a try. 2. StartPage by Ixquick StartPage by Ixquick is another great choice if privacy is your concern. This search engine protects your privacy by not recording your IP address, has a high SSL encryption score, and has received seals and certifications in the privacy industry. Since the search results you receive from StartPage come from Google Search, the basic differences are appearance and settings. With StartPage your filtering options are displayed on the left for timeframe. Your settings can be accessed from the three-line icon on the top right. You can adjust settings for language, theme, search features, results appearance, and privacy. If you really want to stick with the results you get from Google, but still want to go the more private route with your searches, check out StartPage by Ixquick. For Multimedia Google does have a nice way to locate multimedia options within search results by clicking that category at the top. But, if you prefer a more concentrated search for images, videos, and sound effects, then look at these specific search type options. 3. Vimeo for Videos Owned by Google, YouTube is a huge resource for videos of all kinds. But Vimeo has its place in that market too. So you do not have to limit yourself when searching for that instructional, informative, or simply hilarious video clip. Vimeo offers an easy-to-use interface with a handy sorting feature. You can also narrow down your results with filters for category, upload date, duration, price, and license. And like Google’s YouTube, you can follow other users, like and comment on videos, and save your favorites. The most noticeable difference between YouTube and Vimeo is the number of results you will receive for your search. YouTube still leads the way, but just remember that Vimeo is a solid option as well. You can also meet your video search needs with interesting search engines like: blinkx — Search for videos by keywords and also content (conceptual search). Bing Video — Search includes YouTube, Yahoo, Vimeo and other video hosting sites. AOL Video — A powerful search engine which uses its own player for the videos in the results. 4. Yahoo for Images When it comes to searching for images, whether for business or pleasure, an important search feature is filtering. Yahoo’s image search does very well in this aspect. To begin, your results will show you many image options from Flickr and the web. You can then filter your image results by color and size, which is convenient. In addition, you can choose a media type such as photo, GIF, portrait, and clip art and even pick a license option, making it perfect for commercial use. While you can select the Images category by searching Yahoo’s main search engine, you can also head directly to the Yahoo image search site. So just keep this search engine in mind the next time you seek that perfect image. 5. FindSounds for Sound Effects For finding sound effects for your company or personal use, FindSounds is a terrific search engine. You can filter your results before you even begin your search using the convenient checkboxes and drop-down boxes. Pick your file format, number of channels, minimum resolution, and minimum sample rate. From animals to vehicles and everything in between, you can easily search by category in addition to entering a search term. And when your results display, you will see just enough details surrounding the sound effect. Then choose between playing the clip or finding similar ones. Finding sound effects using Google is always an option The Secrets Of Google Advanced Search: 5 Websites With Tips For You To Learn From The Secrets Of Google Advanced Search: 5 Websites With Tips For You To Learn From The Web is a maze and you need more than a few standard operators to wade through it. To come out successfully on the other end, you need to power search. Your weapon of choice... Read More , but with FindSounds you have a specific sound bite engine for speeding up your search. For Giving Back If you are not picky when it comes to your search engine choice and simply use Google for convenience, then try an option that helps you give back. These two engines 9 Smart Search Tools for Safari You Need To Try 9 Smart Search Tools for Safari You Need To Try From search engines that donate revenue to search tools that allow you to find what you need faster, Safari has several great and useful extensions. Read More might just make you feel good with every search. 6. Ecosia When you use Ecosia for your searches, you can take pride in helping the environment. The company donates at least 80 percent of their monthly profits to plant trees in locations like Peru and Madagascar. Due to Ecosia, over six million trees have been planted as of this writing. When you use Ecosia for your search engine, you will see a counter at the top showing how many trees you have helped to plant. The company uses their ads to generate the revenue. However, even if you do not click an ad, you are still assisting the company by increasing their user base. If you are interested in joining an environmental movement with your searches 10 Search Engines To Help The Environment 10 Search Engines To Help The Environment Read More , then definitely check out Ecosia. 7. Lilo Lilo is another search engine that uses its revenue to assist causes. The company supports environmental, social, health, and educational projects with 50 percent of their advertising revenue. And to take Lilo one step further, the search engine does not collect your personal information or allow for ad-tracking. Every time you perform a search with Lilo, you earn a drop of water that equals one point and corresponds to the money you are generating. Plus, you can decide which projects you would like to help. If you like the idea of giving back and would love to assist various projects with a simple search, give Lilo a try. Will You Keep Using Google or Move On? Whether it is for privacy, specific searches, or helping charitable causes, there are certainly reasons that these options are better than Google in their missions. Are you a die-hard Google user and do not plan to change? Do you plan to give one of these a try or do you use one already? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google now shows site’s actual URLs instead of just AMP URLs By Rei Padla - February 7, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter AMP pages definitely make searching and browsing for information easier and faster these days. Google continues to make further changes and now anyone can view and share links more easily by directing them to a publisher’s actual website. Instead of going to a copy of the content and data saved by Google, you are now directed straight to the source. Usually, Google makes a copy of a page and serves it to the browsers. The process has been effective as it is faster. Google renders the pages from their servers from its own servers. However, new issues arise that it is a challenge for people to directly go to a publisher’s website. It’s not really difficult but site owners and publishers aren’t benefitting as much from this. Links still redirects to the publisher but when sharing them, you may not see the exact link as you can only see what was generated by Google. The new update now shows the exact link from the publisher. On the URL field, you will still see the Google URL but a button on the upper right side shows the direct URL of the publisher when tapped. Hold down the anchor button and you can quickly share the link on Facebook, Twitter, or on any where you want to share the content. This enhancement is now live on the iOS version of the app. It will soon be ready for the Android version in the next few weeks. We have a feeling more pages will be “AMP-lified” in the coming days. As more AMP results come up, it’s important that users understand them. When Google pre-renders that pages, you will see the AMP document in a hidden frame. This then makes it possible instant loading of information. The AMP Viewer header bar is also an important part of the results page because it shows a number of important things like the Google AMP Viewer URL and original AMP source. The data are served from the AMP Cache URL that is why they load faster than ever for your convenience.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple New features galore arrive on the ZTE Axon 7, but Daydream VR is the most exciting Andy Boxall Digital TrendsFebruary 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share zte android nougat update news google daydream viewMore We’re about to give you another reason to buy the Axon 7 smartphone. ZTE says Android 7.0 Nougat will be available for the device from February 7, which means not only will it have the latest software version and some great new features, but also support for Google’s Daydream VR. Currently, this is primarily a feature on the Google Pixel phones, which cost several hundred dollars more than the Axon 7. Now, VR fans have a much cheaper way to get in on the Daydream fun. It’s worth it. Daydream VR is close to the experience offered by Samsung’s Gear VR, and way beyond the Cardboard viewer many will associate with VR on other Android phones. The Axon 7 slips into the front of the Daydream VR headset, but it’s not quite the same perfect fit as a Pixel phone. ZTE initially had some problems here, as the elastic strap securing the front of the headset to the body pressed down the Axon 7’s power button causing it to repeatedly turn on and off. To get around this, the update disables the power button when the Daydream software is running. More: All the best Android 7.0 Nougat tips and tricks We tried Daydream using the Axon 7, watching some YouTube VR videos and some games, where the phone’s excellent audio performance really stood out. It’s the stereo, front-facing speakers that do it. Compared to a single side speaker, it’s a much better experience. The Daydream app itself is easy to use, and the separate laser pointer-style controller makes navigation much more intuitive than the Gear VR’s side touch panel. Adding Android 7.0 also brings a few other features to the Axon 7. Side-by-side apps, an enhanced battery saver, and new emojis are all included. Also as part of the software update, ZTE will add Hiya’s phone spam protection and caller ID system, which is ready to get rid of robocalls and let you know who’s calling before you pick up the phone. It’s the first time a phone sold in the U.S. has free spam-call protection. Hiya operates from a library of 1.5 billion numbers, and has call blocking and an auto-block system. All this is great news, but once 7.0 Nougat arrives, the $400 Axon 7 will become the most cost-effective way to enjoy Daydream VR — and that’s even better. We already rate the phone highly, so it’s great to see ZTE continue to support it with a crucial software update that also adds several really desirable features. Axon 7 owners should be on the lookout for a notification of its arrival, and get in their orders for a Daydream headset.

The Chinese smartphone maker last May launched the Axon 7, the first so-called “Daydream-ready” device on the market — however, without Nougat the Daydream support was redundant. Google’s own Pixel-branded phones and Lenovo’s Moto Z line of handsets were the first to fully support Daydream, though a few weeks back Google announced that ZTE’s Axon 7 and the ASUS Zenfone AR would be coming soon. With the arrival of Nougat on the scene from today, Axon 7-owners can now enjoy some Google Daydream goodness. Notably, the Axon 7 is the cheapest no-contract Daydream phone on the market just now, with Google’s Pixel phone starting at around $650, and the Moto Z at $700. The ZTE Axon 7 starts at $400. Bear in mind, Google’s Daydream View headset will normally set you back another $79, though it is currently enjoying a $30 price cut until the end of February.

Snap’s Sole Dependence on Google Cloud Poses Risks for Both February 7, 2017February 7, 2017 by Kiril Kirilov 24shares Snap and Google Cloud Snap is set to become Google Cloud’s largest customer through a deal to purchase at least $400 million of cloud services annually until 2022, the company’s S-1 filing reveals. The deal includes a licence platform agreement with Google for cloud infrastructure services. Though Snap has used Google cloud infrastructure since at least 2013, the new move hints it would become by far Google Cloud’s most important customer, something potentially risky for both parties. “We rely on Google Cloud for the vast majority of our computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of the Google Cloud operation would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business,” says Snap in their Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. This essentially admits the company lacks diversified IT infrastructure and closely ties further progress to Google Cloud services, restrictions, and advantages. A genuine strategic customer The deal obliges Snap to buy Google services worth at least $2 billion by 2020. Google’s reported non-advertising revenue was $3.4 billion in the last quarter, including hardware and Google Play business. Snap’s pledged $400 million a year would make it contribute some 5 to 10 percent of overall Google Cloud earnings, turning it into a genuine strategic customer. “Any transition of the cloud services currently provided by Google Cloud to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and will cause us to incur significant time and expense. We have committed to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years and have built our software and computer systems to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by Google, some of which do not have an alternative in the market,” the filing reads. Risks for Both It is hard to pinpoint the Google services without market alternatives, but Snap are clearly committing to Google for all core infrastructure. The company admits it might lose customers, advertising revenue, or partners if Google services were disrupted or altered. On the other hand, it states that switching to other service providers would be expensive and time consuming. By becoming so reliant on Google Cloud services, Snap exposes their entire business to risk from putative change in Google service. Such change could include limiting Snap access to the Google Cloud platform, hiking prices, offering more advantageous terms to competitors, altering Google’s terms of service in ways that harm Snap’s operations, or outright contract severance. Snap thus becomes hostage to Google Cloud for the next five years at least. Another aspect that could limit Snap’s future growth is that access to Google remains restricted in China. This in turn means Snap could experience serious difficulties entering the lucrative China market. The company itself acknowledges as much: “we also face regulatory challenges that may affect our ability to grow in certain markets. For example, we have very limited access to the China market, as we have not yet established an operating presence in China to support Snapchat. Access to Google, which currently powers our infrastructure, is restricted in China.” Moreover, as Snap admits in the SEC filing, Google themselves might become a competitor. Companies like Apple and Facebook have shown the way this can happen. Though Snap’s own research finds that “In a comparison with Facebook, Google Display Network, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube, we ranked first in overall satisfaction, fourth in plans to increase advertising spend, and third in likelihood to recommend to a colleague,” these findings do not allow Snap to take their market share for granted. In an extremely competitive market, even a newcomer could gain good market share very rapidly – and the possibility remains that newcomer could even be a new Google service.

It may be time to revisit your strategies before it’s too late. 2017 is expected to be big for SEO. Important trends such as Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), RankBrain, mobile-first indexing, and the latest developments in Google’s algorithms will continue to set the course over the next 12 months. This will make a lot of old strategies and techniques obsolete, and will shift the ground for those whose SEO strategies are not up-to-date. If your performance is waning already, here are seven top reasons why that might be the case, and how to change what you’re doing to get back on track. Most Common Reasons SEO Campaigns Fail (And What to Do About Them) 1. Your website is outdated A few main aspects of your website may be the cause for it to rank poorly. These are: Website Architecture A website structure that is too complex and requires users to make three or more clicks to get to the page they’re interested in is a common reason for increased bounce rates. Difficult navigation between pages and drop-down menus with too many links are the other main culprits. Some best practices you should aim for when working on your website structure are: Main pages should be available from a header on the homepage Site structure should follow a logical and predictable order Use breadcrumbs to help with navigation Optimize HTML and CSS code to improve crawlability By improving your site structure you may be awarded sitelinks by Google’s algorithm, which in turn will significantly improve your performance in SERPs. Website Speed Site speed is an important ranking factor. Just by improving the loading time for your site, you may see improvement in ranking. One of the best ways to assess speed is Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool. Run a test for your domain to see suggestions for improvement. Common things that can be improved are: Upgrade your server or invest in better hosting Use external hosting (e.g. Dropbox or AWS) for large files Resize and compress images Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver images Minimize redirects Clean up your code Responsiveness (Mobile-First Indexing) Mobile is quickly overtaking desktop in how people are searching and browsing the internet. That makes the responsiveness of your site and its speed particularly important. This is reflected in a few recent moves by Google: the creation of the AMP project in 2015 and, more recently, the announcement on mobile-first indexing. To stay on top of these trends, your website should conform to the speed requirements in the previous section as well as: Use responsive design or be a dynamic serving website Work with AMP principles Be built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) Be visually pleasing and feature easy navigation and links HTTPS Finally, moving your website from HTTP to HTTPS to offer greater security may provide you with an additional boost in ranking. And by moving to HTTPS you can then also transition to HTTP/2 which may soon become a “must” too! 2. You Haven’t Nailed On-Page SEO Some common on-page SEO elements and best practices which you may be missing or need to update could be dragging your website down. Here are the most important ones: URL A poor URL structure is confusing to both users and search engines. Make sure that your URLs are: Clear, simple, short, and descriptive (avoid numbers) Follow a logical order that mimics your website structure — make URLs guessable Include main keywords (but not excessively) Separate different words in URLs with hyphens, instead of underscores, but do not overuse hyphens either Meta Tags Adding good and relevant meta tags is important for the way your page will appear in SERPs. Your title tag and your meta description are the two most important aspects of your meta tags. To improve your meta tags: Include the primary and secondary keyword in the title tag + brand name Don’t go above 60 characters in your title tag Use unique title tags for every page Aim for relevance, avoid keyword stuffing Make the H1 heading different from the title tag Link Structure On-page SEO is not complete without a good link structure and without cleaning up your broken links. The more internal links you have that go deep and are relevant, the better for users and for your ranking. Here are some things to keep in mind for your internal links: Link between pages and posts on your site including to “deep” content Use relevant links Make anchor text comprehensive, natural, and relevant (do not over-optimize) Use follow links Do not link excessively You should also take care of broken links, especially if you have hundreds of pages on your website. Broken links hurt the indexing of your page, drive away users, and increase the bounce rate. Schema.org and RankBrain Machine learning, or RankBrain, is now Google’s third most important ranking factor for websites. This means that the easier it is for the algorithm to interpret your page, the better your page is likely to rank. To anticipate and meet the growing demands that RankBrain will be placing on websites, you should consider implementing a schema markup on your website. Schema markups are a way of structuring the data on your website so that it can be understood universally by search engines. Schema works as a “map” that indicates to search engines what type of information is contained in each element of your page. By knowing what things on a website mean, search engines can better pick out the content that will be useful and helpful to users in response to their search queries. 3. You’re Not Building Links Properly Beyond internal linking, building inbound links is vital for your site. It is considered the second most important ranking factor, with content being the first. Implementing just any inbound link strategy won’t cut it — links need to be of good quality, coming from authority domains. Consider the following when working on your link building strategy: Vary anchor text when publishing guest posts Do not participate in link networks Disavow any low-quality links pointing to your site Focus on generating content on your website that is valuable and can be used as a resource by others so that they will want to link back to it Discover your competitors’ backlinks and learn about their techniques and sources Build relationships, ask for links, and suggest that mentions are turned into links Of course, outbound links from your website are also an important asset you can use to offer further value to your users and increase their appreciation of your content. They can also be an asset in establishing partnerships with other high-value websites. 4. Your Content is Not Performing Your content remains the most important ranking factor. You can get all other factors right, but without high-quality content, your SEO will continue to fall flat. Common reasons your content is not performing and ranking are: Thin, Short, or Duplicate Content The Panda update of Google’s algorithm primarily targeted websites with thin content that added little value to visitors. So invest in producing content that your readers love and make sure to optimize it for relevant keywords. Avoid using duplicate content as a rule, though by now Google can easily tell which instances of duplicate content are intended to manipulate and which are for greater visibility, for example. You may also experience issues with duplicate content because of how your URLs are set up but there are ways to fix these. Irrelevant Content Along with being longer and fuller, your content also needs to be relevant to user intent. Through Hummingbird, RankBrain, and other algorithm updates, Google is increasingly aiming at understanding user intent and is getting better at taking it into consideration. When choosing keywords to optimize for, consider what the user intent behind those keywords could be. For example, user intent could be navigational, informational or transactional, and your content should ideally match that intent to yield results. 5. Your Content is Not Converting If your site is ranking and driving traffic, but your content is not converting, that’s still an SEO failure — your content should serve your business purpose. To create content that converts users, you should pay attention to: Marketing Personas and The Buyer’s Journey The lack of buyer personas in your content marketing strategy will make it difficult for you to create content that speaks to the different groups of people that would be interested in becoming customers. To improve the conversion of your content: Create detailed buyer persona profiles Create a model of your buyer personas’ journey down the funnel Create loads of content that speaks to each person and is tailored to the particular stage of their journey Mirage Content If you don’t understand your customers well or if your writers do not have enough expertise, you are at risk of creating mirage content. This type of content lacks depth, expertise, precision, and specifics. Mirage content may seem to work for a while because it typically makes a big promise, but it always ends up disappointing. That’s because it usually does not feature concrete problems and their solutions. The main advice for avoiding mirage content is: hire or work with writers who have expertise in your field, good analytical skills, and write in a compelling way. Alternatively, if you don’t have the expertise, interview experts and then turn these interviews into expert content. 6. Your Keyword Strategy Isn’t Working A carefully developed keyword strategy can help you match user intent closely. Some common problems that may occur with keyword strategies are: Targeting keywords that are too competitive Not enough search volume for target keywords Not using long-tail keywords Overusing keywords Not using your analytics to make informed decisions Strive to create a keyword strategy that doesn’t simply focus on keywords with high search volume. These are harder to rank for, on the one hand, and often have a significantly lower conversion rate when compared to long-tail ones. Long-tail ones are also closer to, again, user intent and natural expression. You may also want to consider implementing a hub and spoke keyword strategy. This strategy is based on the idea of a hub (short-tail keyword focused content) being in the middle of numerous spokes (closely related long-tail keyword focused content). The hub piece contains the full information about a topic and also serves as an index that links to various sub-topics or ‘chapters’ that go into greater detail and explain particular concepts — the spokes. If implemented with care, this strategy works well because it: Provides exhaustive information on a topic Offers structured content with a lot of internal linking — this allows search engines to easily understand which piece is the hub and which is the spoke Improves visitor retention — users can move easily from hub to spoke and back, which in turn increases the clickthrough rate, and reduces the bounce rate Increased click-through signals to Google that this content is of high quality which helps it rank higher for the short-tail keyword, creating a self-reinforcing cycle 7. You’ve Been Penalized by Google Ultimately, your SEO campaign may be failing because you’ve been penalized by Google. There are tens of reasons you may get penalized, though the most common ones are because of: A Panda penalty targeting low-quality content A Penguin penalty targeting bad backlinks A Mobilegeddon penalty targeting websites that are not mobile-friendly A Top-heavy penalty targeting websites that feature too many ads above the fold How do you find out if you’ve been penalized? A sudden drop in rankings for your brand name or organic traffic is one indication that you may have been penalized. Your PageRank has dropped for no particular reason or your entire page has been removed from Google’s cached results. What should you do? If you’ve gotten penalized, don’t panic. Try to establish the cause for your penalty. Depending on the nature of your penalty, you may even need to suspend other SEO activities temporarily and focus your efforts entirely on getting the penalty lifted. Conclusion SEO is changing to reflect the changes in search behavior, developments in search algorithms and AI, and the explosion in the production of content. It is becoming more and more integrated with other marketing approaches in order to yield a fuller experience to users. SEO trends in 2017 will be about greater alignment with user behavior. To stay on top, revisit all the main areas of your digital strategy and evaluate what’s working and what isn’t. The most important thing to win at SEO is to keep working on it regularly, instead of letting it catch dust and having to catch up hurriedly the next time Google updates their algorithm.

Sure, Google’s use of machine learning might not be anything new, but understanding how it’s using this technology is vital for the sector which can sometimes struggle to satisfy its notoriously fickle and savvy customer base. NB: This is an analysis by Daniel Bensley, travel industry lead at Qubit. To me, this report highlights a wider challenge for the industry around our approach to AI and machine learning techniques. Whether it’s Google changing its search ranking metrics or technology’s impact on jobs in the sector, headlines around AI are often more likely to spark fear rather than excitement. The fact of the matter is that everyone, across all sectors, needs to better understand how to harness this technology to identify, reach and engage with customers. For the travel industry, in particular, the benefits can be enormous if the technology is understood. Supercharge segmentation The travel sector has regularly outspent all other industries on pay-per-click ads, yet with sometimes as many as 80% of customers abandoning their shopping carts on travel websites there is clearly a wide gap between acquisition and satisfaction. Put simply, travel brands have spent too much time and money trying to attract eyes to their websites instead of thinking about how they can delight customers when they arrive on the site. Naturally travel’s sale cycles tend to be longer and involve a greater degree of research than other sectors, but there is still plenty of room for improvement for operators looking to provide a more relevant, satisfying experience for customers – this can only be achieved by building a better understanding of who your customers are and what they need. Segmentation in travel is nothing new – the sector is in a fantastic position since customers are only too happy to hand over information about who they are and what they are searching for. But many operators are still only scratching the surface, building basic, core segments, using limited data such as “First-time customers vs Repeat customers” or varied stages of the purchase journey. Machine learning can add to and analyse data about a visitor’s behaviour and needs far quicker than any human can, in order to create a hyper-detailed picture of that customer and build deeper, more sophisticated segments. For example, a customer may let you know they’re based in the UK and searching for a family holiday for two adults and two children. A deeper analysis of previous purchase behaviour, combined with real-time customer feedback could tell you that this customer is in the ‘intent to purchase’ phase and likely to be interested in short haul flights, within the school holidays and would respond best to speaking to a call centre adviser. Armed with these insights, a travel brand can then choose how to best engage with this customer in a much more meaningful way than before. With so many variables to factor into travel marketing, machine learning represents a tremendous opportunity for businesses to become far more accurate and targeted with their segmentation efforts. Uncover new opportunities Those headlines that examine the opportunities of AI tend to focus on the end of the funnel – a host of brands have rolled out chatbots to assist customers in finding low-cost flights, while VisitOrlando attracted plaudits for its bot that went a step further and could point interested travellers in the direction of popular brunch spots and craft beer bars. This is obviously the sexier end of the AI spectrum, but in my opinion, the real opportunity is far less visible and much more powerful. AI and machine learning can not only supercharge travel brands’ existing segmentation practices by answering questions about who your customers are – it can help spot entirely new opportunities by identifying more nuanced patterns in this data that would otherwise go unnoticed by a human analyst. Brands can then choose what they want to serve up to these new segments. As we approach St Valentine’s Day you may see customers searching for city breaks during the evening of February 13 are open to spending more than those browsing during for couples getaways in late January. You can make up your own mind on whether these are forgetful last-minute spouses desperately searching for a last-minute gift – machine learning’s role here is to flag the new pattern. You can then decide how you can better serve these desperate customers and point them in the direction of temporary offers for romantic getaways that suit their needs and boost your average order value at the same time. AI shouldn’t be approached as a panacea for the travel sector, but it shouldn’t be feared either. As it stands, machine learning is an incredibly useful tool that allows travel operators to seize opportunities they don’t know exist yet, but like any tool it’s important to not jump in and start using it before having a clear understanding of how you want to use it and the outcomes you want to see. You also need to ensure you’re feeding your AI platform the right data – provide useless information, expect useless results. Ultimately we do need to be careful in developing AI, but not for the reasons many believe. The danger isn’t that we lose control, lose our jobs (it will free us up to do more meaningful tasks) or that Google decides your website isn’t important enough. The true danger is that we let this tech revolution pass us by without tapping into its true potential beyond headline-grabbing bots. AI’s untapped opportunities are legion – if it screws up, then we’re to blame. NB: This is an analysis by Daniel Bensley, travel industry lead at Qubit.

There were none in the article. Reply 7 days ago   Andy We use it for inferring intent for each customer. It means we can then automatically change the sort order (of hotels or holidays, for example) and make them “probably” much better suited to an individual user. There are so many combinations that it would not be possible to do this with normal segmentation or by using hypotheses. Still much room to improve but the results are good and we see more and more uses for the data models that are refined and altered in real time. Reply 5 days ago   Dorian Harris @Andy I get the theory, I’ve just never seen it work in practice, so it would be good to see what you’re working on. From the AI solutions I have experienced first hand, iTunes ‘Genius’ recommendations fall a long way short of genius and Amazon’s ‘you may also like’ throws out loads of rubbish. From what I can see, even Google isn’t a pure AI solution – it’s a rule based system, uploaded in bulk every so often. Here at Skoosh we developed a rule-based fraud system which out-performed all the AI based solutions offered by banks, again despite the fact that banks have far more data to work with. The only time where AI out-performed manual solutions for us was on data-matching which is a completely different use-case to product recommendations.

Reply 7 days ago   Martin Cowley eRoam delivers complex itineraries in seconds to the 18-35 fit traveller using AI to match transport, accommodation, activities etc to the traveler’s profile. Profile is either manually entered or accessed by e.g. Facebook. The content is continuously scanned and made more relevant using social media and other sources to identify what is currently ‘trending’. The content is instantly bookable. It has both B2C and B2B applications. I’ll be happy to arrange a demo if interested. It’s the only way to show you the reality of eRoam’s capability.

Appreciate the feedback. Let’s stay in touch! 13 hrs ago   Martin Cowley Another very good, timely article on this important subject following Atle Skalleberg’s excellent piece on the convergence of man and machine. Dorian, it most certainly isn’t. Check out http://www.eroam.com. Just one example of how AI is already transforming our industry and delivering superior, relevant, instantly bookable content to consumers.

By Jason Cipriani | February 7, 2017 -- 12:00 GMT (04:00 PST) | Topic: Mobility ZTE Axon 7 owners, today is a good day: Android Nougat is now available for your phone. When ZTE first announced the $400 Axon 7, one of the headlining features the company touted was its compatibility with the then unreleased Google Daydream VR platform. Despite meeting all hardware requirements, the Axon 7 lacked the required software - part of which was Android 7.0 Nougat - in order to work with Google's virtual reality platform. review Google Pixel XL: Nexus is dead, long live the Pixel Google's push into becoming a hardware company by creating its own smartphone is off to a fantastic start. Read More However, as of February 7, Axon 7 users can download and install an operating system update that brings with it Android Nougat and checks off all the boxes to make the device compatible with Daydream. Users will still need to purchase a Daydream View headset, which is currently on sale for $50. With the update, the Axon 7 joins the Moto Z and Google Pixel as the only phones with support for Daydream. Competing manufacturers have announced compatibility, but have yet to release necessary software updates. In addition to gaining Daydream, Axon 7 users gain other advantages of Android Nougat such as split-screen apps, better battery life management, and more emojis. ZTE also announced a partnership with Hiya, a caller ID platform that specializes in identifying spam and robocalls. The Axon 7 will now offer Hiya's services at the system level, instead of requiring users install a third-party application as is typically the case. Hiya will attempt to identify and block unwanted spam calls without any interaction on the users part.

How To Make The Most Of Valentine’s Day With Android For Couples Rumor: Galaxy S8’s Bixby AI To Support Up To 8 Languages February 7, 2017 - Written By Dominik Bosnjak The Bixby AI assistant expected to be featured in the upcoming Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus will allegedly support up to eight languages, according to a report published by ETNews on Tuesday. The South Korean outlet is claiming that Bixby will understand seven or eight languages, including English, Korean, and Chinese. If this report is accurate, Bixby will support three more languages at launch than Google Assistant currently does. At the moment, Google’s AI companion understands English, Brazilian, Portuguese, German, and Hindi, and some of these languages may also be supported by Bixby. Previous reports suggested that Bixby will be integrated into all default Samsung Galaxy apps that will come pre-installed on the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. The assistant will allegedly be able to use the camera of Samsung’s upcoming Android flagship to perform a visual search of its surroundings, identify particular objects, and find online retailers that are selling them. Samsung’s AI assistant is also rumored to feature Samsung Pay integration, meaning users will be able to tell it to make purchases. Bixby was likely developed by an AI startup Viv which Samsung acquired in October. Samsung’s recent financial report revealed that the South Korean tech giant is looking to differentiate its future high-end smartphones through both hardware and software, and an advanced AI assistant like Bixby seems like a reasonable way to accomplish the latter. Bixby is also expected to make its way to other Samsung devices in the future and if previous trademarks filed by the company are any indication, Samsung’s AI companion may even be integrated into TVs and Internet of Things (IoT) devices like smart speakers. Overall, most reports suggest that Samsung is looking to create an entire ecosystem around Bixby instead of just using it as a unique feature of the Galaxy S8. More information concerning the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus will likely follow soon seeing how Samsung is currently close to unveiling its upcoming flagship duo. Recent reports suggest that the largest phone maker in the world will officially announce both variants of the Galaxy S8 on March 29, while the devices should be hitting the shelves in mid-April.

In a speech at Central Command headquarters in Florida, the President claimed the press has deliberately minimised coverage of the “genocide” perpetrated by Islamic State. He said: “Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11, as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino. Carlos Barria / Reuters Trump speaks during a visit to US Central Command “And all across Europe we’ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it’s happening. “It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported. In many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.” Trump did not immediately offer up any evidence to back up his claim but the White House later released a list of 78 worldwide attacks it described as “executed or inspired by” so-called Islamic State since September 2014. The "you ain't no Muslim bruv" Leytonstone tube attack is on Trump's list of terror attacks which he says weren't covered by the press https://t.co/rQvLKQYYVb— Robin Henry (@Robin_Henry) February 7, 2017 Most on the list did not get sufficient media attention, the White House said, without specifying which ones it considered underreported. An analysis of the 78 incidents by The Huffington Post UK found the assertions to be largely untrue. Most strikingly it contained incidents such as the 2015 Paris attacks, the Orlando nightclub shooting and the downing of a Russian airliner in the Sinai Peninsula in 2015, all of which were extensively covered internationally. CNN: Trump released a list of terror attacks he says the press covered up/didn't cover. On the list was the Pulse attack in Orlando.,— Ray Lawson (@Lawsonbulk) February 7, 2017 Using simple searches in Google News revealed only seven of the 78 attacks resulted in fewer that 50 news articles. None of those seven incidents involved fatalities and two involved no casualties at all. In total there were at least 1,704,403 results for all 78 attacks, with some such as the attack on tourists in Sousse, Tunisia, in 2015 displaying more than 10,000 articles. Six of those listed brought up over 100,000 Google News search results. White House Spells Out The ‘Truth’ Spelling mistakes were widespread in the White House document, with the word attacker misspelt “attaker” 27 times. Best thing w/ @WhiteHouse terror attack list is that Trump's guys can't spell for shit. I'm not surprised. @POTUS prob can't spell his name— Ketchupy Pangolin (@sauce4you) February 7, 2017 Denmark appears once as “Denmakr” and San Bernardino as “San Bernadino”. There are more typos in the White House's "unreported terror attacks" list than there are unreported terror attacks— Chris York (@ChrisDYork) February 7, 2017 The list doesn’t contain attacks carried out by far-right and white nationalist individuals and also omits any committed in Israel. Nor did it reference the now-infamous and non-existent ‘Bowling Green Massacre’. Trump is using the threat of terrorism to push through his controversial ban on people entering America from seven mainly Muslim countries. Last week, a federal judge blocked the executive order but the Justice Department filed an appeal arguing the travel ban was a “lawful exercise of the president’s authority to protect national security”. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East. Courts must act fast!— Donald J.

Executives at BT, which also happens to own the UK’s largest mobile operator EE as well as wholesale business Openreach, have written to the European Commission (hereafter known as the Gaggle of Red-tapers) to show its support in Google’s on-going anti-trust battle with the bureaucrats. Google is accused of using its dominant position to suffocate competition as handset manufacturers and operators have to pre-install Google apps. Google has been formally accused by the Gaggle of Red-tapers of locking out competitors in the mobile web browsers and search segments, an area which has clear overwhelmingly dominated since Google’s entry. “Google has come up with many innovative products that have made a difference to our lives,” said Margrethe Vestager, the top Red-taper for competition, back in July. “But that doesn’t give Google the right to deny other companies the chance to compete and innovate.” BT’s intervention is believed to be a play to ensure Apple doesn’t get too much of a firm-grip on the mobile market, as it already has a mighty thump considering the premium demographics which it counts as customers. It would appear the anti-fragmentation activities of Android are a compromise which operators such as EE are willing to accept, as long as it keeps Apple in its place. “We can confirm that our legal team has written to the European Commission regarding their investigation,” said a BT spokesperson in an email to Telecoms.com. “We told them (the Gaggle of Red-tapers) BT is free to pre- install its own or third-party apps on devices alongside pre-loaded Google apps. We also said that, as an app provider, we value the ongoing stability and compatibility of operating systems, whether they are ‘open source’ or ‘closed source’. This is why we welcome anti-fragmentation initiatives such as Google’s.” While the Google team may be trying the patience of the Gaggle of Red-taper in the world of mobile operating systems, it is finding some friend in the data protection office. On the company’s blog, it has announced the Gaggle of Red-tapers data protection authorities have approved Google Cloud services’ contractual commitments comply with EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, making it simpler for customers to use G Suite and Google Cloud Platform for international data transfers. In theory, customers will now be able to rely on Google Cloud model contract clauses for the international transfer of data. Considering how sensitive authorities and companies are in Europe on data protection and privacy issues, this is a big win for the company, especially considering the threat to privacy which is currently being faced in the US, where intelligence agencies are pushing their jurisdiction further outwards. Google is one of a few cloud providers which has been given the official thumbs up from the Gaggle of Red-tapers, which could turn out to be a useful weapon as the top four cloud providers jostle for dominance in the fast expanding world of cloud computing. Elsewhere in the cloud business, the team has also welcomed a new customer in the form of Snap. New customers would not usually be considered big news, but the numbers involved represent a significant win for the team. Snap has recently signed a contract with Google which commits the company to spend at least $400 million per year for cloud services, over a five-year period. Over the first four years of the contract, Snap has the option to defer up to 15% of the commitment to the following year, however the difference must be eventually paid. It is essentially $2 billion in the bank for Google, which is a nice buffer to have. Google may be facing its fair share of legal battles, but it doesn’t seem to be having an adverse effect on the business. In fact, you could say Google is thriving.

Not just Toshiba - the global nuclear industry is in crisis everywhere Exposed: Coca Cola's big 'fight back' against tackling plastic waste Trumpocalypse now! But can we believe the Doomsday Clock? Chris Busby 6th February 2017 Tweet The election of President Trump is driving the planet towards oblivion - according to the elite scientific body behind the Doomsday Clock, writes Chris Busby. But isn't Trump's commitment to reduce East-West antagonism and ally with Russia's President Putin against terrorism reducing the risk of nuclear war? So far, Trump is sticking to his promises. Let this one be no exception! So what is the real Doomsday threat? It is the US and British obsession with Russia, the tail of the cold war guard dog of the spy novels, which seems to have taken on a life of its own, long after the dog itself became obsolete and unnecessary. "This is the way the World ends-not with a bang, but a whimper." TS Eliot; The Hollow Men, 1925 The 'Doomsday Clock' has just been moved 30 seconds closer to midnight by 'scientists', complete with video (see below) and a scary film music accompaniment. The Doomsday Clock appeared in 1947 at the beginning of the nuclear arms race. Everyone was reeling from the photographs of the vapourisation of Hiroshima. It was thought that atomic war would wipe out everyone on earth. This almost happened when I was a young man, culminating in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis which the top page of Google informs us was a "direct and dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War." I didn't need to go to Google to find this out. It was a defining moment in my life, and the lives of my friends. Women then were refusing to have children because they didn't want them to live in a world of fear and probable atomisation. We moved to the Welsh mountains in a pathetic attempt to do something, anything, and stocked up with food. In America there was a brisk trade in fallout shelters. It was my friend, the late Ernest Sternglass, who stopped the atmospheric testing, by getting to JFK with the calculation that several million children had died from exposure to fallout Strontium-90, building up in the milk and their bones, seeds planted for the global cancer epidemic which began 20 years later [1]. The Doomsday clock about nuclear annihilation, is a simple illustration of the fact that life on Earth had been around for billions of years but that Clever Old Man had developed a system that could switch it off with an hour-long firework extravaganza. Now it has been extended to global warming, virus pandemics, and more or less anything that the media have decided makes a good story. The clock has been advanced to two and a half minutes to midnight. By Scientists. Let's think about this a bit. Scientists! What scientists? The clock is not a scientific concept. It is an emotional cry for help. What are these scientists using as data for their decision? In the last ten years, for all sorts of reasons relating to the destabilization of the world through various obviously organised operations (Twin Towers, Al Quaeda, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, Syria etc.) a kind of continuous bombing operation or poor countries has contributed to profits of arms manufacturers. Added to all this is the US abandonment of the arms limitation agreements and the re-investment in missile development. We see NATO creeping closer to Russia, and the absurd attempts by the US to bring Ukraine into the operation. Is this why the clock has been moved? No. It is Donald Trump. On the top page of Google (again) we see that the Guardian, Telegraph and 'Science' blame the movement of the clock hands on the election of Mr Trump. ABC seems to think it is global warming. But global warming, even in worst case scenarios (and I have myself followed this and made my own calculations) wont wipe out life on Earth, except indirectly by creating resource wars which might go nuclear. And a virus pandemic would always have some survivors. Total nuclear exchange would not: so that is what we are dealing with. It is a very real possibility. But not because of Donald Trump. What I see in the election of Trump, and in Brexit also, is a spontaneous creation of civil society, in countries which have seen their lives ruined by globalisation and what has been called 'the new world order'. Outrageous, flamboyant, petulant? For sure. But world destroyer? What I see in Mr Trump is an independent flamboyant showman, along the lines of an earlier US President Andrew Jackson, a man who also despised and tried to destroy the US establishment. I have a lot of time for people like this, being a version myself; I watched the media system doing their uttermost to paint Trump as a madman. Trump clearly thinks outside the system of smoke and mirrors that passes for western media news, the constructions on the web and TV and newspapers which are increasingly spun and slanted with nonsense and demonstrable lies about the state of the world. So if I was running the Doomsday clock, the election of Trump would make me put the clock back rather than closer to annihilation. He doesn't trust the US security services. Does anyone? He disassociates his Presidency from the collection of dodgy characters previously running the US global domination operation, including all the presidents in living memory. The votes for Trump and not for Hilary were the eventual revolution against the fat-cat control of America and its continuous war against the people on the planet, fought as if the world were a battleground that it had to dominate. The war machine built up in the post World War II period until the demise of Hilary Clinton is well known to readers of spy novels and if not, can be seen by anyone who looks at the history. It was fuelled by paranoia about Communism (even a child would say that this is a just idea and indeed is at the base of Christianity) and the immense amounts of power and wealth associated with developing and manufacturing weapons. Russian aggression? Where is the real threat coming from? When the Soviet Union broke up and could no longer justify the huge US military budget, other enemies had to be found. Bombs had to be dropped on someone, in order to order new ones. Hence the continuous and endless wars about 'democracy' and 'freedom'. Let's look some scenarios. How big an exchange would represent apocalypse? A baseline is that there were a huge number of nuclear weapons tested in the atmosphere in the period 1952-1963. The peak in radioactive fallout was from 1959 and 1963. This did not wipe out humanity, although there was a mini nuclear winter in the 60s. The European Committee on Radiation Risk [2] estimated some 60 million extra cancers together with a few million dead babies (about 0.2% of births) as consequence. But we are all (just about) still around. Nuclear exchanges between India and Pakistan, or Israel and Iran will not do. The number of warheads involved would result in some mega-Hiroshimas, the global fallout contamination would jump, but not an end of the world. The combined yield of the approximately 100+100 warheads (say 200kT each) just about equal the yield of the 1962 Tsar Bomba 40Mt test on its own. And Iran has no nuclear weapons: but even if it had, an Israel-Iran exchange would be even more feeble than India Pakistan. North Korea? The same. As for China, it has no real enemies, and the Chinese have always been traders rather than invaders. China is doing alright and doesn't need to attack anyone. So what is the real Doomsday threat? It is the US and British obsession with Russia, the tail of the cold war guard dog of the spy novels, which seems to have taken on a life of its own, long after the dog itself became obsolete and unnecessary. It is the sabre-rattling encroachment of NATO on the borders of Russia. It is the deployment of sophisticated (and enormously expensive) antimissile systems in countries like Rumania and Poland. It is the crazy NATO and US generals who want to (and have) put troops and battle-tanks and helicopters in the Baltic States (where I live), on the basis that the expansionist Russians are intent on marching over the borders of Latvia and taking back their lost empire. Which they easily could, by the way, since the Russian military far out-guns the pathetic armies of NATO running about on the Baltic and Polish borders. A worms' eye view from the Baltic I live near Riga. Since I moved there in 2010 I have seen the NATO infestation of the country. Big new tanks with the Latvian Flag rumble though the villages, and helicopters thud overhead disturbing the badgers and deer in the forest. Russia has no need to invade Latvia; it can get what it wants or needs. In fact it is the other way round. Latvia needs Russia. But the media whip up a frenzy of fear, that there will be a Russian invasion, like the one in Ukraine. There is even a book about this insanity, written by a general, retired Deputy NATO commander Sir Richard Shirreff. Like most things in politics, this is about money. The people who make the money control the Media which demonises Trump because he won't follow the master plan to globalise the planet, drive down unit costs by moving production to the lowest wages and control it's diminishing resources (oil) whilst making huge amounts of money for the military and the arms manufacturers, Raytheon, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas et al. involved in the endless global battlefield. I was invited to the Perdana Foundation's Criminalize War conference in Kuala Lumpur, and spoke with Tun Mahatir Mohammed, whose brilliant idea it was [3]. Since then Ditta Rietuma and I have made presentations from conferences in Latvia and Sweden about the dangers of nuclear war, what is driving it, and specifically about this most dangerous confrontation between the USA and NATO and Russia. Now, let's hope Trump makes good his most important election promise ... The election of Trump, who (sensibly) sees no reason why the USA should continue to pay for NATO, is a good thing. His promise to de-escalate tensions between the US and Russia was popular and surely the best of all reasons to vote for him! Finally: one thing. The real Doomsday clock passed midnight long ago. The mad race to extinction fuelled by the market-forces laissez faire western system created a monster: a system which is not really controlled by anyone, but drives itself with only one imperative-to become richer and more powerful, so as to become richer and more powerful. The monster has no soul; it was not constructed to look after life on the planet. Following nuclear fallout, and nuclear energy accidents, Depleted Uranium, and now fracking, background radioactivity continuously increases. The fertility rate is falling. IVF is advancing. Cancer is an epidemic in real terms. This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper.     Chris Busby is an expert on the health effects of ionizing radiation.

Follow 164K Hot Topics: Jeff Sessions Elizabeth Warren Sean Spicer Immigration Google's Dictionary: 'Fascism' Can Only Be 'Right-Wing' By Tom Blumer | February 6, 2017 | 8:17 PM EST Share it Tweet it 0 shares A recent item at The Onion, the online humor site which is now rarely genuinely funny, claimed that "Fearful Americans (Are) Stockpiling Facts Before (the) Federal Government Comes To Take Them Away." Naturally, it was occurring because Americans are "alarmed at the prospect of unconstitutional overreach by the Trump administration." Ha-ha-ha — as if "constitutional overreach" didn't occur at a record pace during Barack Obama's eight years in office (yes, it did). It would appear that those of us who are alarmed at the genuine power-grabbing overreach seen at the titans of tech and at social media companies really need to start stockpiling dictionary entries relating to important words so we can store and retain their real meanings. One alarming example of this need has been delivered by Google's search engine. <<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>> DONATE Google's current dictionary definition of "fascism" returned in searches on that word now limits its application exclusively to "right-wing" governmental systems and views. The limited available evidence indicates that the search behemoth changed its definition last year just before Donald Trump clinched the Republican Party's presidential nomination, and that the web site has been directly associating Trump with fascism in its search results for well over a year. Simply typing "fascism" into Google's search bar returns a listing presented as if it came from an official dictionary (HT Daily Caller): Google's justification for this unilateral limit in the definition of the word it provides to U.S. users is very thin. As the Daily Caller's Derek Hunter observed on Saturday (link in is original; bolds are mine throughout this post): ... Merriam-Webster defines the word “fascism” as “a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.” The secondary definition is “a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control.” This definition reflects the fact that Nazis were, in fact, both fascists and of the political left. They were the “National Socialist German Workers Party,” which favored a heavy-handed government in business and the personal lives of its citizens. Dictionary.com's primary definition is similar, and, by inference, universally applies to both right and left with the relevant characteristics: (sometimes initial capital letter) a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism. Unfortunately, that site also subsequently lists a very muddy and quite offensive "British Dictionary" definition, indicating that 1984-style Winston Smiths have memory-holed the word's original, commonly understood meaning in the UK: 1. any ideology or movement inspired by Italian Fascism, such as German National Socialism; any right-wing nationalist ideology or movement with an authoritarian and hierarchical structure that is fundamentally opposed to democracy and liberalism. 2. any ideology, movement, programme, tendency, etc, that may be characterized as right-wing, chauvinist, authoritarian, etc. British Definition 1 appears to assume that Italian Fascism and the German National Socialism initially modeled upon it were right-wing in nature. The left has tried to perpetuate this false narrative since World War II. The facts clearly show that Italy under "hardline Communist Benito Mussolini" and Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany were authoritarian left-wing governments. This bogus recasting of history, which has until recently been limited to far-left academics and pundits but has now gained wider credence, directly contradicts reality. In his 2009 book Liberal Fascism, Jonah Goldberg reminded the world of several inconvenient truths the left hates to admit, namely that "the original fascists were really on the left, and that liberals from Woodrow Wilson to FDR to Hillary Clinton have advocated policies and principles remarkably similar to those of Hitler's National Socialism and Mussolini's Fascism." British Definition 1 has a bonus for lefties, in that its final sentence gives believers in "liberalism" permission to call anyone who opposes them "fascists." Definition 2 also gives anyone permission to call anyone on the right a "fascist." Both elements of Dictionary.com's British definition are absolute, beyond-the-pale rubbish. The supreme irony here is that Dictionary.com, after listing the U.S. and British definitions, concedes that as used in "culture," Nazi Germany, which anyone who is intellectually honest must acknowledge was a left-wing state, was fascist. But then it inexplicably tells readers readers that fascists today are "usually described as right-wing": The definition's reference to communism's opposition "in theory" to having a "charismatic leader" is a sick joke. Apparently someone forgot to tell the dominant communists of the past century who have ruled on the basis of their personality, including Fidel Castro, Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Ho Chi Minh, Mao Zedong and others, about this theoretical contradiction. Returning to Google's definition, there is some evidence from forum posts (here and here) that Google changed its definition of "fascism" in May of last year after having previously employed the primary Dictionary.com version. The forum posts indicate that the change was made on or about May 23. Donald Trump clinched the Republican Party's nomination for President on May 26. If the change-date references in those posts are correct, that's quite a coincidence, going into what was obviously going to be an intensely contentious 2016 presidential campaign. For those who believe that Google is above wordsmithing and manipulation in the name of politics, Stephen Moore at Townhall observed in December of 2015 that "If you Google 'fascist,' the first thing that pops up on the screen is a photo of Trump." During the 2016 presidential campaign, Google was credibly accused of rigging its auto-suggest feature to limit the visibility of Hillary Clinton's health problems after a New York Times reporter complained that rumors about her health came from "conspiracy theorists." The key point made during this controversy was that the auto-suggestions at other search engines were far more logical in completing partially entered search terms. The Daily Caller's Hunter also noted an important additional missing element in Google's current definition of "fascism": Political conservatives advocate for small, less intrusive government where power rests with the states and individuals, and the federal government lives within its Constitutional restraints. Progressive liberals advocate for just the opposite: a powerful central government with authority vested in a strong leader who has the ability to impose decrees from Washington on everything from health care to education. Google curiously adds “right-wing” to its definition and omits the “severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition” part. By the traditional Merriam-Webster definition of “severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition,” the violent mobs protesting and rioting over President Trump’s actions are the ones engaging in fascistic tactics. ... Many members of the mainstream media have unquestioningly adopted the new Google meaning without explaining why, leaving their audience with the impression that speech or advocacy contrary to liberal orthodoxy is fascistic when, by definition, it is not. At the very least, Google's move, whenever it happened, has been quite convenient for leftists and their media friends who want to justify how they label their political opponents.

Published on February 07, 2017. Every corner of marketing and technology is being shaped by AI. Credit: Bakal/iStock Most Popular It's not enough for marketers to collect petabytes of data; it takes a sharp mind to make sense of it all. Actually it takes a nonhuman one. That's why artificial intelligence has invaded the marketing world, with Facebook, Google, Salesforce, IBM, Amazon and others building machine learning into their platforms. Now marketers must understand the lingo if they're going to survive the machines. To help, here's a guide to the terminology around A.I. Machine learning When a machine teaches itself with minimal programming needed. Google showed off the powers of machine learning when it created a computer that learned the rules to the ancient game Go. Machine learning can be helpful in direct marketing and email marketing, in particular, by ingesting sense of vast sets of consumer data and using it to determine things such as the best times to send emails. Proponents say it can also identify the clients or customers that would be most receptive to given messages. And machine learning is used in ad targeting to help deliver messages to those audiences. Image recognition AI looks for patterns in images. Machines can obviously analyze many more images than humans, and with machine learning they can identify what's in the images and reveal patterns that people would never detect. Brands can use image recognition technology, for example, to find every photo online in which their logos appear. That could help brands locate their most loyal customers and tease out other actionable marketing insights. "Computer vision" is a term associated with image recognition, and refers to computer programs that analyze and categorize digital images. Clusters A fancy word for a group of people—or anything—sharing a common characteristic. AI programs can identify clusters within mountains of data, uncovering patterns that humans alone couldn't perceive or connections that people alone wouldn't draw. Clusters can lead to developing audiences or segments for marketing purposes, creating a group of people with common traits and targeting them with ads. Unstructured data A term for disorganized pools of data that appear random and unconnected. Machine learning can make sense of the data, and it can identify clusters within it and other patterns that could be useful when making marketing decisions. Marketers gather all kinds of data, even if it doesn't seem relevant at the time, because they never know when something interesting is going to pop up. Natural Language Processing The technology that enables machines to interpret what people are saying in words or in text. Sophisticated AI can decipher speech, not just understanding the words but the context. Advanced natural language processing, or NLP, could detect sarcasm and other subtle human tones. Natural language processing is essential to the automated customer service of the future. Chatbots The programs running inside messaging apps and on websites that help consumers perform simple tasks. Chatbots were popularized by apps like Facebook Messenger and Kik, and they operate like apps within the messaging services. Brands and publishers build chatbots to do things like deliver news stories and facilitate e-commerce transactions. The smarter chatbots become, the better they understand language, the more useful they can be. Chatbots could become the personal assistants of the future, booking flights, making reservations and handling schedules. Deep Learning A more advanced branch of machine learning, where a computer teaches itself with only minimal amounts of programming. With deep learning, marketers can make the most use of data and apply it to make predictions about consumer behavior. Neural Networks Artificial intelligence programs modeled after the human brain. They incorporate deep learning and natural language processing to perform functions like recognizing handwriting and faces in photos. Dynamic Pricing One of the common tasks that deep learning-based programs can perform, setting prices based on consumer data. Dynamic pricing means that each consumer is presented with a price based on their own particular circumstances, depending on the time of day, their financial situation and other factors. Dynamic pricing can come into play in rates for plane tickets, for instance. AI can help craft personalized prices that are most likely to ensure a sale at the most efficient rate. Recommendations/Content Curation AI is useful in figuring out what goods to recommend to shoppers based on data, the way Amazon volunteers products that a visitor to its site might want. When a consumer visits a sneaker website, for instance, AI can help determine which the person might like based on their past browsing habits and other factors. A website could be customized for each visitor, much as Facebook's algorithm personalizes the feed users see, tapping AI to order its content in the way most likely to appeal. Weak/Narrow AI AI that's limited to specific tasks. Basically all of the AI found in marketing is weak. Most AI overall—the code behind everything from virtual assistants to self-driving cars—is actually considered weak. The next evolution is artificial general intelligence, bringing us closer to the long-anticipated, futuristic robots that could outperform any human at any task.

NetEase, China’s second-largest operator of online games, has approached Google about forming a venture to launch Google Play in China, The Information reported, citing people familiar with the discussions, without identifying them. Google’s spokesperson in Hong Kong declined to comment, while NetEase officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Talk had been swirling for years in internet circles about Google returning parts of its business to the world’s most populous market, ever since it withdrew its search engine from China after clashes with Chinese censors over search results, and following a 2010 cyberattack on users of its Gmail email service. Google needed a Chinese partner that could help it navigate the intricacies of operating in China, Alphabet’s chairman Eric Schmidt had previously said. “Partnering with Google to launch the Google Play store in China means that NetEase can also launch its apps in the store to gain traffic and user base,” said Kitty Fok, managing director for IDC China. Google Play will still have to abide strictly by the Chinese government’s censorship rules, she said. Google Play surpassed Apple Inc’s App Store in 2013 as the world’s largest market place for obtaining mobile applications, with 2.2 million apps published and 50 billion downloads, according to Phonearena.com Still, the developer of Android-based apps will have a lot to catch up on in China. China’s most popular store for downloading mobile applications is MyApp, run by the country’s largest operator of social network and online games, Tencent Holdings, according to market intelligence company Newzoo. Mobile Assistant by Qihoo 360 Technology, the online security and utility company, is second, while app stores by Baidu and Xiaomi are third and fourth, Newzoo said. “Google and NetEase face the challenge of having to convince device manufacturers to pre-install the Chinese version of Google Play on smartphones in China to gain market share,” Fok said. “Google Play already has the largest number of global apps in its store internationally. The joint venture could also help more Chinese developers make their apps available to international users of Google Play.” This isn’t Google’s first attempt to return to China. Sogou, China’s third-largest internet search engine and a unit of Sohu Inc, was discussing a partnership with Google, whereby the US company would use its algorithm to conduct the searches, while Sogou will screen the search results to comply with China’s censorship rules. Although Google has not provided its services to users in China after its departure in 2010, the company maintains offices in Hong Kong and Taiwan, where it sells digital advertising to Chinese companies who wish to advertise internationally. Google is also in constant dialogue with Beijing as the company seeks to eventually re-enter the Chinese market, Schmidt said previously. Google co-founder Sergey Brin also previously stated that certain units of Alphabet, as Google’s holding company is called, may return to China, hinting at the company’s ambitions to once again operate in the country. Google also partnered with Chinese telecommunications and device manufacturer Huawei in 2015 to produce its Nexus 6P smartphone, a move that industry insiders suggested could soften China’s stance towards the US company.

He ruled that Google promoting Google Maps to the top of its search results above competitors’ products did not produce an appreciable abuse of dominance. “So far as ground two is concerned,” continued Lord Justice Jones, “the applicant submits the OneBox disproportionately favoured Google Maps. Firstly, as the party against whom allegations were raised, it was for the respondent to show that the abuse was objectively justified. However, the respondent was unable to show that… [they] had not discharged the burden of proof.” The OneBox is the box which pops up in response to certain geographical search queries made on Google. It features a Google Map and often address details. Although Streetmap did put forward a number of things it said Google could have done to redress the situation, Lord Justice Jones concurred with the earlier judgement in dismissing all of these. Addressing the court on behalf of Streetmap before Lord Justice Jones gave his judgement, Tom Sharpe QC said: “What [Mr Justice Roth] should have done - ‘this is an important element of a case being pleaded, I should hear evidence about it because the burden is... square on Google’ - but he didn’t.” Mr Sharpe told the court that Mr Justice Roth had effectively got the burden of proof wrong and left Streetmap “in the unenviable position of having to prove a negative” and added that that “was an improper and unfair burden on Streetmap which it was unable to discharge.” He added that Google “produced nothing and the judge filled the vacuum” on its behalf. “Google [had not denied] it was dominant in the online search market,” said Lord Justice Jones. “[Mr Justice Roth] accepted that the market for online search and for online maps were two separate markets. It was not suggested the respondent, Google Maps, was dominant in the separate market for online maps.” The judge added: “Any potential effect on that related market had to be appreciable, and he found no appreciable effect had been demonstrated…. The respondent’s conduct was objectively justified.” Permission to appeal against Mr Justice Roth’s original judgement of February 2016 was refused. ® Tips and corrections 82 Comments Whitepapers Mapping the Demands of Real-World Apps - One IO at a Time Averaging doesn't provide an accurate picture of true application performance based on data gathered using InfoSight and analyzed.

Safer Internet Day 2017 is being celebrated globally on Tuesday, with the theme `Be the change: unite for a better internet`.  "We need to simplify and amplify ways by which users in India can stay safe. Safer Internet Day provides for an important opportunity to engage and encourage young users across the country to learn more about keeping themselves as well as their peers and families safe online," Chetan Krishnaswamy, Director (Public Policy) Google India told reporters. Google has been working on tools including spam detection and `Safe Browsing` measuring billions of signals across sites and apps to make the web and the constellation of Android apps as well as devices safer, he added. `Safe Browsing` feature warns users against unsafe websites found infected with malware, virus or a phishing trap.  Google has also developed the `app analyser`, a modified version of `Safe Browsing` that specifically hunts for dangerous apps in Google Play, other app stores, and on the web, and warns users on identifying any unsafe application.  As an effort to promote digital literacy and spread awareness around internet safety, Google India on the occasion of `Safer Internet Day` distributed awards among the winners of the second edition of the Web Rangers initiative in India.  As part of this Web Rangers contest, young kids were asked to create and run their own online safety campaigns in the form of social campaigns, posters, videos and apps. "Google remains committed to providing all users a safe online experience, and help make the broader web of sites and apps more secure as well," said Sunita Mohanty, Director (Trust and Safety) Google India.  Google executives present on the occasion suggested that users should take quick Security Checkup -- an easy way to review and manage Google Account`s security settings and keep the Google Account more secure.   First Published: Tuesday, February 7, 2017 - 16:42 More from zeenews   India Jallikattu held in Alanganallur, 47 injured Chinese soldier who crossed over to fly back home after 5 decades Give evidence to back allegation against Chidambaram in Aircel-Maxis deal: SC to Swamy More from India World South Koreans abducted by Pyongyang growing: Expert group Islamic State group executes five Egyptians accused of aiding army Pakistan Senate committee dissatisfied over government's attitude on CPEC More from World Sports Is it the end for Arsene Wenger?

Safe Browsing feature warns users against unsafe websites found infected with malware, virus or a phishing trap.

"Google remains committed to providing all users a safe online experience, and help make the broader web of sites and apps more secure as well. We're constantly improving our automatic protections, but we also want to make sure our users are empowered with the controls to adjust their security settings to ensure a safe experience," said Sunita Mohanty, Director, Trust and Safety, Google India. Google has developed the App Analyser, a modified version of Safe Browsing that specifically hunts for dangerous apps in Google Play, other app stores, and on the web, and warns users on identifying any unsafe application. In addition, Verify Apps, a separate protection, runs directly on Android devices, proactively checking more than six billion apps and 400 million devices every day. Launched in 2015, Web Ranger's Program aspires to empower young Indians to make responsible choices online and provide them with the right tools and knowledge to make these choices. The program has already reached more than 25,000 students ambassadors and teachers covering 12 states and 90 cities across the country. These participants have been trained on Internet safety to further spread the message and empower young minds and encouraging young people in their schools and communities to consider issues such as the effects of cyber bullying, managing one's own digital footprint and online tricks and scams. The contest, announced in November 2016, saw wide enthusiasm among kids from all around the country including young kids representing government schools to become 'Web Rangers- Guardians of the Internet galaxy'.

The theme of Safer Internet Day 2017 is 'Be the change: unite for a better Internet'. "We need to simplify and amplify ways by which users in India can stay safe. Safer Internet Day provides for an important opportunity to engage and encourage young users across the country to learn more about keeping themselves as well as their peers and families safe online," Chetan Krishnaswamy, Director (Public Policy) Google India told reporters. Google has been working on tools including spam detection and 'Safe Browsing' measuring billions of signals across sites and apps to make the web and the constellation of Android apps as well as devices safer, he added. 'Safe Browsing' feature warns users against unsafe websites found infected with malware, virus or a phishing trap. Google has also developed the 'app analyser', a modified version of 'Safe Browsing' that specifically hunts for dangerous apps in Google Play, other app stores, and on the Web, and warns users on identifying any unsafe application. As an effort to promote digital literacy and spread awareness around Internet safety, Google India on the occasion of Safer Internet Day 2017 distributed awards among the winners of the second edition of the Web Rangers initiative in India. As part of this Web Rangers contest, young kids were asked to create and run their own online safety campaigns in the form of social campaigns, posters, videos and apps. "Google remains committed to providing all users a safe online experience, and help make the broader web of sites and apps more secure as well," said Sunita Mohanty, Director (Trust and Safety) Google India. Google executives present on the occasion suggested that users should take quick Security Checkup - an easy way to review and manage Google Account's security settings and keep the Google Account more secure.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Android Security Bulletin for February starts rolling out By Rei Padla - February 7, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We’re on the second month of the year and so far, so good. At least, if we’re talking about the regularity and timing of Google releasing Android security patches. This isn’t the full Android update but just security patch levels as of February 5, 2017. We learned about the last one straight from LG before the official Google announcement.That’s still a good sign because it meant that Google and OEMs have coordination. This patch level delivers a fix for a critical security vulnerability. There’s no report yet of remote code execution but to be safe, the Android team wants every user to take on the issue on possible affected devices. This one is released as an over-the-air (OTA) update. The two security patch level strings include the Partial security patch level string (2017-02-01) and the Complete security patch level string (2017-02-05) being addressed. Eligible Google devices will soon receive OTA update with the latest security patch level. Here is a list of download and OTA links as shared by 9TO50Google: • Google Nexus 6P.

OEMs are struggling Fiery Samsung's feeling drained 7 Feb 2017 at 10:34, Andrew Orlowski The rollout of Android 7.0 on some Samsung devices has smacked them right in the battery. Meanwhile in the background, further competition issues around the Google mobile OS are brewing. Testing by GSMArena reveals a dramatic loss of battery life on the Samsung S7 Edge (Exynos 8890 version) using the platform update. Battery life fell by three hours on its Wi-Fi browsing test, and five hours on the video test. HTC and Sony only began to roll out Nougat last month and both were also hit by technical issues. Normally, a buggy platform update wouldn’t make headlines. Few but the most enthusiastic users perform OTA (over the air) updates anyway, and a fix soon follows. But this year it’s different. With its new Pixel phones, Google has begun competing head on with its Android customers - and Samsung is its biggest rival. It’s spending heavily to promote itself as an Android OEM, something it never did with its Nexus phones. The problem? Google needs to persuade the competition authorities that it maintains a level playing field. We have no comparative data about the effects of Android updates on Pixel hardware, but new Android platform releases appear on Google’s own phones before anyone else’s, and Google’s own Pixels appear to have a point release ahead of the competition. Furthermore, Google added features to its own Pixel range that it didn’t make available to other Android phone makers - like the Google Assistant - a new development since last April, when the European Commission went public with its Android objections. Google has found it increasingly difficult to get big platform updates onto devices that have already shipped. Many devices are not upgradeable to major new releases, Edison analyst Richard Windsor points out. The Commission believes Google may have abused its position by tying products and services in three separate markets in which it enjoys a monopoly: mobile app stores, search and “licensable smart mobile operating systems”. The consumer organisation for Europe, BEUC, filed a complaint against Google with the European Commission – reportedly the first antitrust complaint it had ever filed. If Google is perceived to favour Pixel over rivals, that spells further trouble. ® Tips and corrections 34 Comments Whitepapers Mapping the Demands of Real-World Apps - One IO at a Time Averaging doesn't provide an accurate picture of true application performance based on data gathered using InfoSight and analyzed.

Frequently, the only hint at the original link is a brief mention at the top -- share the page you're looking at and you'll give people Google's AMP cache, not the actual site. You won't have to wonder where the original link went for much longer, though. Google is fulfilling a promise by adding a simple way to share the source for an AMP story. When you're looking at an article you tapped in search results, the AMP header bar will have an anchor button that shows the original link. You can even hold down that button to trigger your browser's native sharing feature when available. Just when you'll see the feature depends on what platform you're using, and where you're surfing. People using the Google app on iOS can see it right away. Android users, meanwhile, will see this updated approach through native functions (including the Google app) sometime in the "coming weeks." It's a simple addition, but it'll help shake the notion that Google is hijacking pages and promoting its own technology over the articles you're reading.

Home Industry Uber’s next bet is Elevate as Travis Kalanick hires veteran NASA engineer to develop flying cars Uber’s next bet is Elevate as Travis Kalanick hires veteran NASA engineer to develop flying cars In 2010, an advanced aircraft engineer at NASA’s Langley Research Center named Mark Moore published a white paper outlining the feasibility of electric aircrafts that could take off and land like helicopters but were smaller and quieter. The vehicles would be capable of providing a speedy alternative to the dreary morning commute. By: Bloomberg | Published: February 7, 2017 4:03 PM Now Moore is leaving the confines of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, where he has spent the last 30 years, to join one of Google’s rivals: Uber Technologies Inc. In 2010, an advanced aircraft engineer at NASA’s Langley Research Center named Mark Moore published a white paper outlining the feasibility of electric aircrafts that could take off and land like helicopters but were smaller and quieter. The vehicles would be capable of providing a speedy alternative to the dreary morning commute. Moore’s research (PDF) into so-called VTOL—short for vertical takeoff and landing, or more colloquially, flying cars—inspired at least one billionaire technologist. After reading the white paper, Google co-founder Larry Page secretly started and financed two Silicon Valley startups, Zee Aero and Kitty Hawk, to develop the technology, Bloomberg Businessweek reported last summer. Now Moore is leaving the confines of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, where he has spent the last 30 years, to join one of Google’s rivals: Uber Technologies Inc. Moore is taking on a new role as director of engineering for aviation at the ride-hailing company, working on a flying car initiative known as Uber Elevate. “I can’t think of another company in a stronger position to be the leader for this new ecosystem and make the urban electric VTOL market real,” he says. Uber isn’t constructing a flying car yet. In its own white paper published last October, the company laid out a radical vision for airborne commutes and identified technical challenges it said it wanted to help the nascent industry solve, like noise pollution, vehicle efficiency and limited battery life. Moore consulted on the paper and was impressed by the company’s vision and potential impact. Watch This Also: Nikhil Goel, Uber’s head of product for advanced programs, says the company wants to organize the industry to help spur development of flying cars. “Uber continues to see its role as an accelerant-catalyst to the entire ecosystem, and we are excited to have Mark joining us to work with manufacturers and stakeholders as we continue to explore the use case described in our whitepaper,” Goel wrote in an e-mailed statement. Moore acknowledged that many obstacles stand in the way, and they’re not only technical. He says each flying car company would need to independently negotiate with suppliers to get prices down, and lobby regulators to certify aircrafts and relax air-traffic restrictions. But he says Uber, with its 55 million active riders, can uniquely demonstrate that there could be a massive, profitable and safe market. “If you don’t have a business case that makes economic sense, than all of this is just a wild tech game and not really a wise investment,” Moore says. Uber’s vision is a seductive one, particularly for sci-fi fans. The ride-hailing company envisions people taking conventional Ubers from their homes to nearby “vertiports” that dot residential neighborhoods. Then they would zoom up into the air and across town to the vertiport closest to their offices. (“We don’t need stinking bridges!” says Moore.) These air taxis will only need ranges of between 50 to 100 miles, and Moore thinks that they can be at least partially recharged while passengers are boarding or exiting the aircraft. He also predicts we’ll see several well-engineered flying cars in the next one to three years and that there will be human pilots, at least managing the onboard computers, for the foreseeable future. His move to Uber is a risky one. Moore says he’s leaving NASA one year before he’s eligible for retirement and walking away from a significant percentage of his pension and free health care for life “to be in the right place at the right time to make this market real.” (Though it’s probably safe to say that Uber, with some $11 billion on its balance sheet, is making it worth his while.) Moore seems to be disillusioned with NASA, saying the agency is leaving promising new aviation markets to the private industry. “It’s the federal government who is best positioned to overcome extremely high levels of risks,” he says. While NASA is larded with layers of bureaucracy and management, Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has been closely involved in hatching his company’s flying car plans, Moore says. That is, when he’s not distracted with his own political crises, such as his role on President Donald Trump’s advisory council, which he relinquished last week after criticism from customers, drivers and employees. Kalanick’s bet on Uber Elevate is another indication that while Silicon Valley seems on the surface to be consumed with politics and protests these days, the march into the future continues apace.

Google has collaborated with digital fashion house Ivyrevel to demonstrate Coded Coutre, an innovative app to make dresses from user data. Ivyrevel, supported by the H&M group has collaborated with Google to create an app that makes a data dress. Google takes the user’s permission to track the activity of a user over a duration of a week. Do you eat out, or chill with friends at home? What places do you regularly visit? Are your meetings more casual or formal? How active is your lifestyle? What were the typical weather conditions over the duration of the week? These are the kinds of questions that the application answers automatically, and then churns the data into a digital dress, that is most appropriate for all the situations that a user might normally find oneself in. Aleksandar Subosic, co-founder of Ivyrevel, says “”It’s such an exiting moment. We’re about to change the fashion industry by bringing the customer’s personality into the design process through data technology. To get a unique piece of clothing today you need to either buy a custom-made design piece or design it yourself, but that is generally not an affordable option and most people lack the design experience. The Data Dress enables women around the world to order a dress made entirely for them, that reflects the way they live their lives.” The implementation specifically uses the Snapshot API to track a user over the course of the week. Users simply have to carry their phone around for the application to work, and they can see their dresses evolve on a daily basis. The resulting data dress will be available worldwide. The materials, silhouette, and personal embellishments get modified according to the lifestyle of the user. The dresses still embody the polished and bold Ivyrevel style. Ivyrevel is beta testing the application with select global style influencers, and even giving away some digital dresses for free. The application is expected to launch publicly later this year.

The company on Monday made few minor changes to its AMP results page that is focused on providing additional functionalities to users to view, copy, and share the original URL instead of Google's own AMP URL while also providing true origin of the content appearing on the AMP results. The new changes will start showing up on the Android Google app in the coming weeks. On Android, Google app will share the original URL of a document when users tap on the app's share button. Notably, this functionality is already available on the iOS Google app. The move to show publisher's own link is said to be due to backlash from publishers that alleged Google stole mobile traffic, as pointed by TechCrunch. Google explains why AMP documents used to show three different kinds of URLs, which actually made it worse for publishers. The original URL was the publisher's document written in the AMP format; AMP Cache URL was the document served through an AMP Cache though most users never saw this URL, and lastly, Google AMP viewer URL, which displayed in an AMP viewer or on the search result page. Google however defended its decision to stick with three URL formats. It said that the different URLs existed for caching and pre-rendering. To provide appropriate attribution of content, Google will add a header bar that displays the "true" origin of a page. "On the web, a lot - URLs and origins represent, to some extent, trust and ownership of content. When you're reading a New York Times article, a quick glimpse at the URL gives you a level of trust that what you're reading represents the voice of the New York Times. Attribution, brand, and ownership are clear," said Alex Fischer, Software Engineer, Google Search in a new blog post. Google will be also adding support for access, copy, and share the canonical URL of a document which the company says was requested by publishers. The new feature will allow users to use their browser's native share functionality by long-tapping on the link that is displayed. "Today [Monday], we're adding a feature to the AMP integration in Google Search that allows users to access, copy, and share the canonical URL of an AMP document," further said Fischer. Google started India rollout of Accelerated Mobile Pages for mobile search results last year.

Google has been working on tools including spam detection and 'Safe Browsing' measuring billions of signals across sites and apps to make the web and the constellation of Android apps as well as devices safer, he added. 'Safe Browsing' feature warns users against unsafe websites found infected with malware, virus or a phishing trap. Google has also developed the 'app analyser', a modified version of 'Safe Browsing' that specifically hunts for dangerous apps in Google Play, other app stores, and on the web, and warns users on identifying any unsafe application. As an effort to promote digital literacy and spread awareness around internet safety, Google India on the occasion of 'Safer Internet Day' distributed awards among the winners of the second edition of the Web Rangers initiative in India. As part of this Web Rangers contest, young kids were asked to create and run their own online safety campaigns in the form of social campaigns, posters, videos and apps. "Google remains committed to providing all users a safe online experience, and help make the broader web of sites and apps more secure as well," said Sunita Mohanty, Director (Trust and Safety) Google India. Google executives present on the occasion suggested that users should take quick Security Checkup -- an easy way to review and manage Google Account's security settings and keep the Google Account more secure.

EPA/Drew Angerer/pool Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn In 1996, when the web was in its infancy, the American technology writer Nicholas Negroponte predicted that the coming digital revolution would facilitate a “cottage industry of information and entertainment providers”. Twenty years on and the story of “fake news”, which had wide currency during the US election, and was found emanating from basements, cafes and computer labs in the small Macedonian city of Veles would appear to prove Negroponte correct. Except that we are living in an era when vast sections of our media, both “old” and “new”, are controlled by a tiny number of giant corporations, most of which dominate their particular sectors and face minimal competition. Take the local news sector which only recently argued that an arbitration system as proposed by Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act would undermine plucky community-based titles and weaken local democracy. The problem is that five conglomerates account for 80% of all local newspaper titles while the remaining 58 publishers account for just 20% of titles. Or take the UK’s supposedly competitive national newspaper market where five companies – largely presided over by tax exiles and media moguls – control 90% of daily circulation. If you take online readership into account, which bumps the Guardian up the rankings, then six companies fall into this category. The situation is even more dire when it comes to the increasingly profitable digital world. Yes, it’s possible to argue that there is a cottage industry of, for example, app and video game developers. But distribution – the means by which content actually becomes available to consumers – is subject to serious bottlenecks because of the grip exerted by dominant companies. So while there may be thousands of digital start-ups, they have to face the fact that Apple and Spotify alone account for 63% of the global streaming market and that Facebook is fast becoming the most popular digital platform for news. Meanwhile Google has some 90% of global desktop search and Google and Facebook together account for around two-thirds of all digital advertising in the US. According to the Financial Times, 85 cents of every dollar spent on digital advertising in America went to those two companies in the first quarter of last year – evidence of “a concentration of market power in two companies that not only own the playing field but are able to set the rules of the game as well”. Setting the agenda One of the great misconceptions, however, is that the bewildering market power wielded by the likes of Google and Facebook has come at the expense of the mainstream press and broadcasters. Established, reputable, professional news organisations and the “real news” that they produce, are apparently losing the ever evolving struggle for eyeballs. It is a misconception because it conflates decline in the traditional market for news with a weakening of gate-keeping and the influence of editorial agendas. Although commercialism and agenda have always been closely intertwined, they have never been the same thing. Ironically, the power vacuum left by evaporating profits and retreating corporate investors in news publishers has put many newsrooms back in the hands of extremely wealthy individuals, from local oligarchs in Eastern Europe like Lajos Simicska in Hungary to dot.com billionaires such as Jeff Bezos. Mainstream press dominated by six big companies who control 85% of uk circulation. Lenscap Photography The missing piece of the puzzle is the complex ways in which Google, Facebook and Twitter are, if anything, reinforcing the agenda-setting power of the mainstream news brands. Google’s news algorithm, for instance, gives priority weighting to news providers with scale, volume and those who cover topics that are widely covered elsewhere. The problem with fakery is not so much the cottage news industry, but dominant algorithms and ideologically polarised audiences that are supposedly enabling it to flourish. It is, after all, nothing new: the tabloid press will certainly not be remembered for being champions of truth-telling. The problem is more to do with the failure of those very news brands that Google considers “reliable sources” to offer a meaningful corrective to fakery – and, worse, their tendency to amplify it. As for the post-truth politics of Trump, it wasn’t his provocative and offensive “tweets” that enabled him to burst on to the mainstream political scene, but the way in which mainstream news networks were, from the outset, hanging on his every word. The more offensive, provocative, outlandish the comment – the bigger the lie – the more newsworthy it became. Twitter gave him a platform, but mainstream news provided the microphone, and it is amplification – the ability to be heard – that is the major currency of agenda power. Media elite We are, therefore, witnessing not the demise of concentrated “voice”, but its resurgence in more subtle ways. What can be done about this? We can hardly rely on our elected governments when they seem more comfortable to bow down to digital giants and media barons than to challenge them. For example, the latest research carried out by the Media Reform Coalition and the campaign group 38 Degrees shows that there has been an increase in the number of private meetings between representatives of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire and government ministers ahead of Murdoch’s bid to take full control of Sky, the UK’s largest broadcaster. In September 2016 alone, News Corp’s chief executive, Robert Thompson, had back-to-back meetings with the prime minister, Theresa May, the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, and the culture secretary, Karen Bradley. May even found time to meet with Murdoch that month during a one night trip to New York. The major problem facing our democracy isn’t the subterranean digital activities of Macedonian teenagers corrupting a supposedly pure news environment. Instead, it’s the fact that we have a media culture that is dominated by billionaire proprietors and elite insiders and a political culture that is too fearful of this media power ever to challenge it. “Fake news” may be grabbing the headlines but we shouldn’t forget about the concentrated market power that has allowed it to thrive.

On one hand, there's no other country with more users of the company's mobile operating system. On the other, the vast majority of the Chinese devices running the OS don't contain any of Google's apps and services. That's what makes a fresh report about talks to launch Google Play in China intriguing. Though such a deal wouldn't amount to a full return of Google's services to the Middle Kingdom, and although local app store competition abounds, the need for the company to have a meaningful app distribution channel in China has never been higher. Sources tell The Information that Chinese online gaming/content provider NetEase (NTES) has approached Google about launching Google Play in China through a JV. The site cautions it's unclear if the talks will lead to a deal, and that past discussions between Google and Chinese tech companies haven't resulted in anything. Reports that Google wants to launch a Chinese app store go back as far as 2014. As far as partners go, Google could do worse than NetEase, which for years has teamed with game publisher Activision (ATVI) to offer World of Warcraft in China. A booming Chinese app store market provides Google with a fresh incentive to do a local Google Play launch. Research firm App Annie believes publisher revenue stemming from Apple's (AAPL) Chinese iOS App Store more than doubled annually in the fourth quarter to over $2 billion, leading it to surpass the U.S. as the world's most lucrative App Store market. Revenue numbers are harder to come by for China's fragmented Android app store market, but with Android accounting for over 80% of Chinese smartphone sales, it's a safe bet that the total market is substantial. China now has close to 600 million smartphone users, and the lion's share are on Android. A Chinese Google Play would also provide Google with a means of distributing some of its many mobile apps within the country. It's unlikely to include Google Search -- AWOL in China since 2010, after Google chose to shut down its local search engine rather than continue censoring its results -- or YouTube. But apps and services for which censorship is less of a concern, such as Google Maps, Apps, Photos and (assuming a third-party search engine is integrated) Chrome, could be easier to provide. In addition, bringing Google Play to China would help Google make inroads with Chinese developers at a time when many of them are at the vanguard of creating cutting-edge mobile apps and services, particularly related to messaging, payments and e-commerce. Forging direct ties with more of these developers could lead a greater number of them to do overseas Android app launches. Google could also cross-sell developers on its mobile ad services. Though many of its core services remain blocked in China, Google still does a fair amount of business selling ads in the country through its ad networks. It could both pitch developers on monetizing their apps using its AdMob mobile ad network, and on promoting their apps via AdMob, Google Play and (for apps available overseas) Google Search. Google would face no shortage of local app store competition. Chinese search giant Baidu  (BIDU) and messaging/gaming giant Tencent each have high-profile Android app stores, as do Qihoo 360 and smartphone maker Xiaomi. Several other phone vendors also offer app stores that they pre-install on their devices. But between the company's own apps and services, its ties with Chinese developers that have done overseas app launches and the near-ubiquitous support Google Play has among big developers outside of China, Google still has the means to make its presence felt. And it certainly has a lot of incentives to do so. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money. Click the "+Follow" next to my byline to this article.

Arnav Nagpal (14, Gurgaon), Ashutosh Sahni (17, Jalandhar), Krishna Pandit (14, Noida), Nitika Gadura (13, Bangalore) and Sarthak Gupta (13, New Delhi) were chosen as the top five national winners among thousands of entries received from students across the country. Winners will receive Chrome books and tablets as their winning prize. As part of this contest, young kids were asked to create and run their own online safety campaigns in the form of social campaigns, posters, videos and apps. Winning entries were judged and selected based on creativity, reach and impact. "Many of the internet users in India are coming online for the first time. We need to simplify and amplify ways by which they can stay safe. Safer Internet Day provides for an important opportunity to engage and encourage young users across the country to learn more about keeping themselves as well as their peers and families safe online," said Chetan Krishnaswamy, Director, Public Policy, Google India. In order to ensure a safe online experience, Google has been consistently working on systems and tools including spam detection and Safe browsing measuring billions of signals across sites and apps to make the web and the constellation of Android apps as well as devices safer. Safe Browsing feature warns users against unsafe websites found infected with malware, virus or a phishing trap. Google shows tens of millions of safe browsing warnings every week on more than 2 billion devices, across a variety of web browsers. "Google remains committed to providing all users a safe online experience, and help make the broader web of sites and apps more secure as well. We're constantly improving our automatic protections, but we also want to make sure our users are empowered with the controls to adjust their security settings to ensure a safe experience," said Sunita Mohanty, Director, Trust and Safety, Google India. Google has developed the App Analyser, a modified version of Safe Browsing that specifically hunts for dangerous apps in Google Play, other app stores, and on the web, and warns users on identifying any unsafe application. In addition, Verify Apps, a separate protection, runs directly on Android devices, proactively checking more than six billion apps and 400 million devices every day. Launched in 2015, Web Ranger's Program aspires to empower young Indians to make responsible choices online and provide them with the right tools and knowledge to make these choices. The program has already reached more than 25,000 students ambassadors and teachers covering 12 states and 90 cities across the country. These participants have been trained on Internet safety to further spread the message and empower young minds and encouraging young people in their schools and communities to consider issues such as the effects of cyber bullying, managing one's own digital footprint and online tricks and scams. The contest, announced in November 2016, saw wide enthusiasm among kids from all around the country including young kids representing government schools to become 'Web Rangers- Guardians of the Internet galaxy'.

The talking computer HAL 9000 from the film 2001: a Space Odyssey - perhaps the proto chatbot Photograph: Allstar/MGM/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Jason Orlovich Tuesday 7 February 2017 04.00 EST Last modified on Friday 10 February 2017 11.47 EST Odds are you talked to a robot last month. Artificial intelligence in the form of retail chatbots capped a huge year for e-commerce over the festive season, from supermodel personal shoppers to customer service. What seemed like a fun curio when IBM’s Watson was winning game shows only five years ago is now the “secret sauce” in a massively changing ecosystem. But one conversation that seems to have been remarkable absent from this revolution is any popular discussion around how, why and what we name these tools. Especially as the semantics around such technology is upending the very foundation of language: who knew you could order a pizza without words? Michael Mauldin coined the term “chatterbot” to describe these conversational programs in 1994. He also named the first verbot (or verbal robot), Julia, while a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. HAL, Siri, Alexa, Cortana: We’ve been creating avatars in our likeness ever since. Today, more than 34,000 chatbots exist on Facebook Messenger since the company opened the platform to outside developers in April, including one from the Guardian. Now a few of those language designers have begun breaking down this odd human-computer relationship – and yes, it’s still a little wonky. From weapons to healthcare, we shape technology in our image – even though, as many point out, these bots don’t care what we call them. “Giving something a human name is a way of exerting control over it,” writes Adrienne LaFrance in The Atlantic, “a reminder that it works for you, that it exists within a human construct, even when the machine itself is wholly indifferent.” Expressing our trust through a wholesome moniker says nothing about AI’s effectiveness and everything about our comfort with the software, she says. So the robots are coming, and how we embrace that future will depend on how much we see ourselves in the technology. In fact, naming your bot is the first big question for any technologist, according to Dennis Mortenson, the founder of x.ai, whose popular assistant programs are called Amy and Andrew Ingram (initials AI, of course). Designers like Jacqueline Feldman at Kasisto (responsible for the bot Kai) have written about the more problematic aspects of personifying these tools, while giants like Google still decline to discuss the process publicly. LaFrance says the origin stories of popular bots like Siri usually say more about the engineer (or Silicon Valley culture) and basic market research – a female voice is less offensive; removing the name and first person pronoun improves user feedback, apparently – than any evil conditioning agenda. Only now our tools are talking back. It’s also worth noting that Google’s new AI assistant is simply called, well, Google. Does that make you feel any better? Or how about Facebook’s recently leaked messaging assistant, M? Even as companies de-gender and refine their products, the future looks the same: these are tools to entice and comfort with an “identity” we all recognize. We are increasingly anthropomorphizing our technology, but how are we defining ourselves in this new era? As a journalist, I hear enough jargon and wordplay to keep a running log. One phrase in particular gets me every time: “I’m sorry, I don’t have the bandwidth.” In other words: I’m too busy, distracted, overwhelmed to sufficiently address your question. More recently, it’s the variant: “I’m sorry, I’m at capacity.” My reaction is always the same: please, you’re not a router. And that seems to me the real frontier with AI semantics: if chatbots don’t care what we call them, what does it say when technology starts naming us? Or more accurately, we start assuming the names and attributes of our brave new world? It seems benign, but not having the bandwidth says I’m too busy to engage like a human. “Hey, it’s not personal,” the logic goes, but that’s exactly where we’re headed. Google’s one-word solution squares its ambition with a growing sophistication; it wants to build an individual Google for each of us. Is it so crazy then to think that we’re giving our machines human names and “personalities” to appear more relatable, to make us more comfortable, only to simultaneously use the language of technology to replace actual human emotions? Just say you’re busy next time. Sure, you might be swamped this week, but you’re not a piece of hardware. I’d argue it’s not cute nor particularly healthy to align our emotional states with this stuff – unless we’re ready for what that means. As one designer notes, her success is making technology disappear, to make these AI tools “quieter” so we humans can use them more intuitively. But if intuition is the opposite of conscious reasoning that doesn’t sound very helpful to me. We have a choice to engage in the world we create despite the ubiquity of the tools we share. It’s why that robot didn’t just buy the shirt for you. It’s a subtle but profound reality that still exists, from the margins of my notebook to the Internet of Things all around us. Language is a tool, after all. Let’s use it.

Although the companies are risking a backlash from customers who side with Trump, they say the pushback is necessary for an industry dependent on thousands of highly skilled foreign workers. About 58 percent of the engineers and other high-skill employees in Silicon Valley were born outside the U.S., reports the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, an industry trade group. “Immigration and innovation go hand in hand,” said Carl Guardino, the group’s CEO. “This cuts so deeply into the bone and marrow of what fuels the innovation economy that very few CEOs feel the luxury of sitting on the sidelines. So people are going to stand up and speak up.” The tech industry contends there aren’t enough Americans with the specialized skills these companies need. The ban, tech companies say, would make hiring even tougher and pressure them to move some operations abroad. “A lot of these companies will really struggle if all of a sudden we turn off the spigot,” said Greg Morrisett, dean of Cornell University’s Computing and Information Science school. In a court filing Sunday against the ban, 97 companies, including Google, Apple, Microsoft, eBay, Netflix, Facebook and Twitter, also spoke of the entrepreneurial spirit of “people who choose to leave everything that is familiar and journey to an unknown land to make a new life.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella both came from India. Google co-founder Sergey Brin is a Russian refugee who moved to the U.S. as a boy. The father of Apple’s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, immigrated from Syria. The Silicon Valley Leadership Group estimates that half the companies in the region were co-founded by an immigrant or are now led by a CEO from outside the U.S. In signing an executive order Jan. 27 that would temporarily ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries, Trump said he was trying to protect Americans by preventing terrorists from slipping into the country. The administration says the president has the constitutional authority to decide who can enter. Several companies ran Super Bowl ads that promoted diversity and inclusion, as marketers tried to reach both sides of a consumer base roiled by the election. One of the most overtly political was from Airbnb, a company that matches travelers with places to stay. The San Francisco company showed close-ups of people with different ethnicities. A narrator says: “We believe, no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept.” Airbnb followed up with a campaign to provide short-term housing over the next five years for 100,000 people in need, starting with refugees, disaster survivors and relief workers. The company also said it will donate $4 million over four years to the International Rescue Committee. Meanwhile, Google set up a $4 million “crisis fund” in January to support organizations that help immigrants and refugees, while ride-hailing service Lyft pledged $1 million over the next four years to the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups challenging the ban. And workers from Google and Comcast have staged walkouts over the restriction. “I wouldn’t be where I am today or have any kind of life that I have today if this was not a brave country that really stood out and spoke for liberty,” Brin told a crowd of Google employees who walked out in protest last week. Tech companies risk alienating the many Americans who support Trump and his policies. But their risk is lower than that of, say, a company that makes consumer products with plenty of alternatives. It’s much harder to boycott a Facebook or Google, where you have friends or your email address, said digital marketing analyst Rebecca Lieb. She added that people are less likely to toss out a $2,000 laptop or pricey mobile phone than change soft drinks. In fact, the anti-Trump side might worry tech companies more. Last week, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit Trump’s council of business leaders after an outcry from Uber customers and employees who were upset about the ban. In addition, most tech companies have operations around the world and risk alienating customers abroad if they stay silent. “We interact with a large global ecosystem and our businesses would not be here or be able to thrive without it,” said Aaron Levie, CEO of Box Inc., an online storage service. “So our businesses are extremely sensitive, by default, to things that affect immigration and things that affect our relationship with the broader world.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Google Not Giving Up on Plans to Launch Play Store in China GO Google might partner with NetEase in China Feb 7, 2017 08:48 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Owners of Android-running smartphones from many countries around the world rely mainly on Google’s Play Store for downloading various applications and getting updates. But the situation is strikingly different in China, where the Play Store seems to be blocked. A new report from The Information reveals that Google hasn’t given up on plans to make the Play Store available to people in China and the tech giant is reportedly in talks with Chinese Internet technology company NetEase. At this point, there’s no guarantee that a deal will be made between the two companies, but Google would surely be a valuable partner for NetEase. In addition, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt did say that Google needs a business ally in order to negotiate with the Chinese government on restrictions for making the Play Store available in the country. Google would have to make some comprises in China China’s business section is met with many government-imposed restrictions and it wouldn’t be surprising if Google had to make some tweaks to the Play Store before making it available to the Chinese people. It’s actually very likely, considering that Apple was forced to pull certain applications from the App Store, as per a request from Chinese government censors. Apple recently pulled the New York Times app from the store in China, and it would be interesting to see which apps Google will have to pull from its Play Store. Google would also have to host app data in China, which is one of the main requirements for app developers in the country. Currently, Chinese users of Android smartphones rely on third-party sources like Alibaba and Tencent to get apps and updates. In terms of smartphones, China is one of the biggest markets out there, which means it’s a big market for app developers too. Access to the Play Store in China would not only benefit Google, but also app developers who could make their product available to a larger number of people. #Google#Play Store#China#Alphabet#NetEase subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Releases February Security Update for Pixel and Nexus Devices Google Redesigns Maps for Android, Adds Quick Access to Commuting Info Google Play Store vs Apple’s App Store - A Comparison Google Now Launcher to Be Discontinued by the End of March Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Larger Samsung Galaxy S8 to be Dubbed S8+, Leaked Logo Reveals Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One    Google logo on headquarters New Android APKs HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments BlackBerry Releases New Teaser for Mercury Announcement Ahead of MWC more on: BlackBerry i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Supported devices should already start to see an over-the-air (OTA) update rolling out to Nexus and Pixel phones. The device firmware images have also been released to the Google Developer site. The wave of updates contains previous fixes as well as patches for a large number of other vulnerabilities. Luckily none of them seem to be currently exploited in the wild, although Google did note that: "The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files." So as always, it's a good idea to update straight away. 2017-02-01 security patch level—Vulnerability summary Security patch levels of 2017-02-01 or later must address the following issues. Issue CVE Severity Affects Google devices?

The security patches have also been made available as part of the Android Open Source Project so that third party manufacturers can publish their own system updates. While Nexus and Google Pixel users can expect the OTA to start arriving on their phones right now, everyone else will have to wait for their respective manufacturer to test and roll out the patch level. You can check if there's an update by going into Settings > About phone > Check for update.

Here is a section: When Netflix started creating its own content, in 2013, it shook the industry. The scariest part for entertainment executives wasn’t simply that Netflix was shooting and bankrolling TV and film projects, essentially rendering irrelevant the line between the two. (Indeed, what’s a movie without a theater? Or a show that comes available in a set of a dozen episodes?) The real threat was that Netflix was doing it all with the power of computing. Soon after House of Cards’ remarkable debut, the late David Carr presciently noted in the Times, “The spooky part . . . ? Executives at the company knew it would be a hit before anyone shouted ‘action.’ Big bets are now being informed by Big Data.” Carr’s point underscores a larger, more significant trend. Netflix is competing not so much with the established Hollywood infrastructure as with its real nemeses: Facebook, Apple, Google (the parent company of YouTube), and others. There was a time not long ago when technology companies appeared to stay in their lanes, so to speak: Apple made computers; Google engineered search; Microsoft focused on office software. It was all genial enough that the C.E.O. of one tech giant could sit on the board of another, as Google’s Eric Schmidt did at Apple. These days, however, all the major tech companies are competing viciously for the same thing: your attention. Four years after the debut of House of Cards, Netflix, which earned an astounding 54 Emmy nominations in 2016, is spending $6 billion a year on original content. Amazon isn’t far behind. Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat are all experimenting with original content of their own. Microsoft owns one of the most profitable products in your living room, the Xbox, a gaming platform that is also a hub for TV, film, and social media. As The Hollywood Reporter noted this year, traditional TV executives are petrified that Netflix and its ilk will continue to pour money into original shows and films and continue to lap up the small puddle of creative talent in the industry. In July, at a meeting of the Television Critics Association in Beverly Hills, FX Networks’ president, John Landgraf, said, “I think it would be bad for storytellers in general if one company was able to seize a 40, 50, 60 percent share in storytelling.”   Eoin Treacy's view The march of technology enabled content creation is undeniable and irreversible. The simple reason from a business perspective is that relying on human beings to be individually creative is fraught with uncertainty, ambiguity and time management issues. Computers on the other hand excel at getting the job done on time and within budget. The challenge has always been to try and teach computers how to be creative.   Email of the day - on nickel's underperformance Do you know why Nickel is not joining in the commodity boom and whether eventually it might? Wonderful service   Eoin Treacy's view Thank you for your kind words and this question which may be of interest to other subscribers. Indonesia has historically been the primary supplier of nickel but from 2014 it toyed with banning exports of ore in an effort to stimulate domestic production of refined metal This article from Stratfor, dated October 12th carries some additional detail. Here is a section:  The decision to delay the ban once again, announced by the acting chief of the Energy and Metals Resources Ministry on Oct. 4, comes as little surprise. Though foreign investors have committed some $12 billion to build 27 smelters nationwide in the past four years, anecdotal reports and trade data indicate that much of that money has yet to generate higher exports of refined metal products. In one example, the value of Indonesian exports of raw nickel ore — of which the country was once the world's largest producer — has collapsed. In 2013, the year before the first ban took effect, it stood at $1.65 billion, but by 2014 that figure had dropped to $85 million; by 2015, it had fallen to zero. Though exports of refined nickel products rose in 2014 from 2013, they, too, plunged in 2015 and continued to decline in value through the first four months of 2016. Nickel is not unique in this respect, either: The value of metal ore exports as a whole has collapsed, and that of most refined metal products has stagnated or declined. The 2014 ban came on the heels of a slowdown in China's economy and a dip in metals prices, caused in part by the increasing ore supplies of key competitors such as the Philippines. Low prices then undercut investor interest in building smelting facilities, as did uncertainty surrounding the status of Indonesia's regulations. Meanwhile, the lack of even minimal support infrastructure for construction operations meant that the companies that agreed to build smelters often found themselves responsible for building and funding roads, power generators and other basic utilities to support them. Nevertheless, despite these headwinds, many smelting projects are still underway or in the planning stages.

Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons during Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium in Houston on Feb. 5. (Photo: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports) 672 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Terry Bradshaw had yogurt for breakfast on Monday morning. He says he was careful not to get any on his clothes. “Hey, you know what?” he says suddenly. “I do have coffee on my shirt — I just noticed.” And then Bradshaw lets out a guffaw, long and loud, just like the one you know from FOX NFL Sunday where he yuks it up with Howie and Jimmy and Michael and Curt, men’s men who love to laugh. “When I have to go wash this shirt I’m going to get my Tide out,” Bradshaw tells USA TODAY Sports. “And here we go, you know what I mean?” You do if you watched the Super Bowl. That’s where Bradshaw appeared on the broadcast and in one of the day’s most-liked commercials. In fact, at one point it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began, a meta moment for the digital age. Bradshaw and Curt Menefee appeared in a quick spot to promote the halftime show and Bradshaw had a big barbecue stain on his white dress shirt. The internet almost short-circuited. A couple of commercial breaks later, all was made clear. The stain was the beginnings of a clever commercial for Tide. AD METER: WATCH ALL THE COMMERCIALS USA TODAY Watch all the 2017 Super Bowl commercials USA TODAY Hyundai's 'live' commercial puts deployed soldiers at Super Bowl with families Menefee points to the stain. Bradshaw vamooses to get it clean. He runs across the field as the game goes on. He exits the stadium in a golf cart, gets forced off the highway by a truck and crashes into the front yard of Jeffrey Tambor, who uses Tide to get the stain out — and his basset hound face to mine for more laughs. Oh, and that stain? It was the real deal. “No watercolor or anything,” Bradshaw says. “It was real barbecue sauce, Jack. I tasted it.” The surprise 60-second spot finished fifth in USA TODAY’s Ad Meter, an annual consumer vote. “I haven’t been top 5 in anything in my life,” Bradshaw says. “How cool is that?” This from a man who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1970 NFL draft and won four Super Bowls. That was the quarterback record, shared with Joe Montana and Tom Brady, until Brady won his fifth on Sunday. “I’m so fine with this,” Bradshaw says. “I was so happy for him. I had my moment. I could have gotten my five or six, but I didn’t. He did — and in such dramatic fashion. I harbor no jealousy. You have to admire this and put it in its proper category.” That category is greatest quarterback of all time. Bradshaw says he loves Montana but Brady is the best. “They can’t find his jersey,” Bradshaw says. “You know where his jersey is? I got it. I’m washing it right now with my Tide, right here in the laundry room. I’m going to send it back to him after I get it clean.” You could say Brady and Bradshaw won the Super Bowl, one on the field and the other in the ads. “Well, I got fifth,” Bradshaw says, then reconsiders. “Wait, there you go. There’s my fifth ring right there — a ring around the collar.” PHOTOS: BEST OF THE SUPER BOWL FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Patriots win Super Bowl LI with epic rally  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
